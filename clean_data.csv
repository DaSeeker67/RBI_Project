https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_SpeechesView.aspx?Id=1397,Date Changing Paradigms in the Financial Landscape,Distinguished guests Good evening First of all let me thank the Indian Banking Association IBA and FICCI for inviting me over to deliver this address today Its a pleasure to be here amidst such a gathering of important stakeholders across the spectrum of our financial landscape In a very short span of time FIBAC has achieved a prominent status for being a premier brainstorming event on emerging themes of relevance to the financial world I am sure that you have had an open and insightful discussions on several important issues over last two days The theme for FIBAC 2023 winning in the uncertain times is very apt in the current scenario Therefore my remarks today would centre around this theme ie managing the uncertainties that we are living with and those which lurk on the horizon and later dwell upon how we could navigate such uncertain times Prudent Risk Management When we think of uncertainty we immediately think of risk and risk management The people in the field of finance often have a lovehate relationship with risk While most entities are willing to assume risks on their balance sheets sometimes there are reservations to plan and provide for it often due to costs involved While there are obvious incentives for taking risks an overdose of risk in a leveraged entity like a bank or a finance company can be disastrous if not managed efficiently Therefore the regulators and policymakers endeavour to make policies to facilitate overall financial stability and occasionally give out didactic fiats and guidance stressing on importance of systemic resilience To give you an analogy the prudential guidelines are akin to a diet plan given by the physician If you stick to them your balance sheets would look healthy Then as the supervisor RBI also conducts annual health checkups in the form of onsite visits to see that what looks healthy from outside reflects the position accurately with no hidden illness If indeed there are symptoms of illness medication in terms of timebound action plan to not only treat the symptoms but to address the root cause is prescribed In a way prevention is better than cure is an apt mantra in the financial world too Drawing a reference to the five natural elements which human body is composed of let me outline my version of five elements make the foundation of a robust and resilient financial system These are a Strong governance and management b Sound regulatory principles c Adequate capital and liquidity d Strong supervisory and risk management practices and e Effective crisis management and resolution frameworks I do not think that I need to elaborate on these as these elements will be quite familiar to this audience Our microprudential risk management framework revolves around two very simple yet powerful measures provisioning and capital requirement one for anticipated loss component of the asset portfolio at risk and another for unexpected loss component The third component ie liquidity has been under lot of discussion in global forums of late However it may yet be worth reiterating that in India we implemented the Statutory Liquidity Ratio SLR way back in 1949 which required the banks to maintain a level of high quality liquid assets mostly in the form of government securities to essentially address this concern The importance of these measures have been reinforced repeatedly through the frequent international episodes of financial crises Perhaps the higher quantum and better quality regulatory capital requirements have helped the financial system around the globe to navigate the turbulence in the wake of Covid and other crises that we experienced of late A resilient financial system is one that can withstand and quickly recover from the episodes of financial shocks and crises Such a financial system also requires early identification of vulnerabilities and risk buildup within each entity as well as at the system level and initiation of appropriate corrective actions So it is of utmost importance that banks as well as other financial entities are always vigilant regarding buildup of risk pockets in their balance sheets and operations adopt prudent risk management practices and are transparent in disclosing risks to the regulator and other stakeholders Changing paradigms in banking The recent crisis episodes in the US and Europe have brought back the question of robust and sustainable business models again to the fore The business models of the banks have evolved depending on the roles they have played throughout the history with the current focus being on the intermediation paradigm ie acceptance of deposits and credit creation However this approach needs to change with newer players entering the financial service space and disrupting the traditional rules of the game In the newer paradigm markets are likely to become the central point for intermediation where banks may become but one amongst the host of other entities interacting in the marketplace The traditional banking business model needs to pivot to address this evolving paradigm Another important transition which is underway is the changing consumer preferences While this customer driven evolution is often slow its mostly definitive and nonreversionary The future of banking cannot be imagined without visualizing the needs of post Generation Z consumers those that are yet to be tagged by an alphabet The future generation of customers are likely to consume financial service in the same way that they consume other products and service and banks may have to be prepared to make that transition Therefore let me imagine the contours around a few aspects of where we would likely see banking in the next decade or so under the marketplace based and consumer preference driven paradigm Let me emphasize here that what I am going to tell lies in future more in the realm of the probable but the undercurrents of this transition are already visible i The first point is that the banks will have to transition from a sectoral approach to an ecosystem approach The oftrepeated pitch is that all the banks of future will actually be technology companies also undertaking business of banking While its difficult to be certain that this will indeed be the case it is likely that the era of exclusiveness of providing banking services by banks are over With BankingasaService BaaS model making steady and silent inroads the banks have to operate as a part of the larger ecosystem with good number and varieties of nonbank players in the mix A lot of these transformations are already becoming visible Banks and NBFCs are partnering with FinTechs to deliver financial products and services by deploying innovative methods and technological solutions ii Second the banking of future is going to be hyperpersonalised and banks may have to shift from isolated service provisions to hyperpersonalised embedded banking In future probably banking may cease to be a separate service Instead banking would be embedded in all the products and services which consumers are expected to avail Embedded finance is the integration of financial services or tools within the products or services of a nonfinancial organisation So in future customer may not have to visit a bank branch to avail a home loan For example when you login on the builders app to book a flat the app could be integrated to the banks app or to a fintechs platform and when you enter your KYC identifier the loan eligibility would be automatically calculated using your consent to pull your financial and nonfinancial information through account aggregator Digi Locker and loan would get disbursed All this would take place within few minutes if not seconds Technological solutions would allow banks to offer prices that could continuously adjust to customer behavior and preferences while responding to supply and demand position margin requirements and competition All this hyperpersonalisation would become possible as we increase our digital footprints and banks or their partnering digital companies learn how to get AIML based decision outputs from this data iii Third the current form of business segmentation may give way to customer preferencesbased verticals The focus of tomorrows banks has to go beyond just its business to better meet customers needs Hence the segmentation will be based on homogenous customer groups and all products would be designed to serve these segments Hence the core strength of the successful banks would be customer segment specific Even now some banks often in partnership with fintechs are trying to target some specific segments such as MSMEs Women Senior Citizens millennials etc We already have examples elsewhere that where the traditional banks have failed to innovate and adapt to the new needs of the customers disruptors such as Nu Bank in Brazil have come in and captured the market filling the vacuum and offering products and services that were demanded by the customers iv Finally the traditional breakup of assets and liabilities may likely undergo drastic changes Currently the balance sheet of Indian Banks is dominated by loans on the assets side and deposits in liabilities side We could expect transformation of composition of bank balance sheets during the forthcoming decade driven by the natural progression of the Indian economy This transformation will be further propelled by the widespread integration of technology into business operations and decisionmaking It is possible that customer preferences in future may shift from the passive saving products like a fixed deposit to more esoteric and market linked investment products Alternate avenues will compete to tap the depositors money on account of better returns and convenience of a finance super app to meet all financial needs may become the norm Tokenisation of assets and liabilities using the power of DLT may change the way bank balance sheet is structured All these changes would mean adjustments to the traditional assetliability structure of banks So given these risks and changing paradigms let me share a few thoughts so as to how we will have to manage these challenges As the bank balance sheet transforms we and when I say we it means both RBI and banks would have to refocus our priorities from a risk management perspective From the regulatory side we may have to relook at the risk management frameworks especially for liquidity and market risk From the banks side active monitoring of deposit concentration and diversification of funding sources may become even more important As the March 2023 banking crisis in the United States and the events at Credit Suisse showed despite having capital and liquidity comparable or in some cases better than the industry levelpeer levels the banks failed Therefore to address these concerns we may have to look at qualitative metrices such as enhanced disclosures strong code of conduct and clear governance structures Simultaneously the selfregulation by the industry through SelfRegulatory Organization SROs needs strengthening to promote responsible conduct and innovation We have to focus on fortifying cyber security and prevention of cyber frauds in the hyperpersonalised and techbanking environment The banking landscape is fast evolving with increase in financial inclusion customer access product choices and convenience However the risks to the consumer have also increased There are increasing instances of frauds and data breaches Customer today are facing threat from technology induced frauds such as fraudulent apps breach of privacy and deep fakes Even misselling has emerged in a digital avatar now called Dark Patterns Dark patterns are design interfaces and tactics used to trick users into desired behaviour such as availing highcost shortterm consumer credit masquerading as an instant loan We must work hard work smart and work together to protect customer from these threats to retain and strengthen their trust A key element of protecting customers is to provide them an efficient prompt and cost effective grievance redress mechanism Unfortunately it appears that the efforts of the banks to provide timely solutions to customer grievances have not kept pace with explosion in technology and products While banks are hugely invested in forging new and innovative ways of customer acquisition very little thought seems to be going on improving the customer grievance redress mechanisms To me this seems very odd for a sector which prides itself on being a service industry We definitely wish to see more serious thought and intent emerging from the Boards and top executives on quality of grievance redressal instead of just monitoring TAT and MIS on complaints A related point which would help banks in winning the customer segmentation paradigm is bringing in greater empathy into their services products and operations For example there is a need for greater effort to provide safe and friendly techbanking to senior citizens Banks must require their employees to treat senior citizens people with special needs those that are technologically challenged or someone who may need help otherwise with special care and empathy The Boards must ensure that their access points branches websites and apps are user friendly and convenient for the customers with special needs From the regulatory side we are taking up these subjects more vigorously in our interaction with the industry but there is also a need for a cultural and attitudinal change within the fraternity that I would like to emphasise Conclusion To conclude Over the course of time it has been said several times that we need banking but not banks This prophecy is yet to become true I am certain that banks will continue to be the primary drivers of Indias growth story but the trajectory that the banks would adopt during this transition will determine how the banking landscape will look in the next decade As far as regulations are concerned they have to keep in view of the overall financial system stability ensure resilience of the institutions and attempt to bridge the information asymmetry While we laud the fact that nextgen banking is fast becoming a reality aided by innovations in the fintech space we also need to continuously work to redefine the regulations and the regulatory frameworks to support these innovations and deliver on our mandate of financial stability while protecting the customers At the same time the innovations and collaborations need to be well thought out risks properly analysed and mitigation plans put in place before offering them to customers Thank you once again for this opportunity to share my thoughts with you 1 The inputs provided by Rupesh Kumar Kanaujiya Saurabh Pratap Singh Peshimam Khabeer

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_SpeechesView.aspx?Id=1396,Date Winning in Uncertain Times The Indian Experience,I am thankful to FICCI and IBA for once again inviting me to this FIBAC Conference1 As momentous changes are taking place in the financial and business landscape events like this provide an opportunity to industry leaders bankers and policymakers to deliberate on issues of our times and crystallise our thoughts for future guidance Today the world is grappling with an unending string of challenges since 2020 Geopolitical conflicts geoeconomic fragmentations volatile commodity prices uncertainty in trajectory of monetary policies and their macrofinancial implications increasing frequency and ferocity of climate shocks all these prevailing together present a very complicated or should I say deadly mix of challenges Historical regularities are looking improbable and policymakers are being put to test In this backdrop the theme of todays conference winning in uncertain times aptly captures the longstanding quest of humanity to make progress against all odds and challenges I am an optimist and I remain confident that we can work together and navigate through this stormy weather 2 In tune with the theme of the conference I would like to touch upon the Reserve Banks policies and actions in the last one and half years to maintain macroeconomic stability I would then proceed to talk about Indias growth drivers and emerging opportunities that can be harnessed to enhance Indias potential growth In the end I propose to highlight certain key issues which merit the attention of banks NBFCs financial sector entities and even businesses The Conduct of Monetary Policy in the Year Gone By 3 The monetary policy actions of the Reserve Bank over the last one and half years consisting of prioritisation of inflation ahead of growth narrowing the Liquidity Adjustment Facility LAF corridor increasing the policy repo rate by 250 bps draining out excess liquidity together with supply side measures by the Government have facilitated significant softening of headline inflation to 49 per cent in October 2023 The moderation in core inflation in particular is noteworthy 4 There is also recent evidence of household inflation expectations becoming more anchored2 Headline inflation however remains vulnerable to recurring and overlapping food price shocks coming from global factors and adverse weather events The frequency and intensity of such shocks have increased in recent period Monetary policy in such a scenario needs to remain watchful and actively disinflationary while supporting growth 5 I must add that our actions over the past one and a half years did not engender any financial stability risks as witnessed in some advanced economies in the early part of 2023 This may be attributed to the regulatory requirements prescribed by the Reserve Bank which banks are expected to follow to manage their interest rate risk These requirements act as safeguards for future stress that may arise when the upturn of the interest rate cycle takes place3 6 On the exchange rate front the Indian rupee INR has exhibited low volatility and orderly movements relative to peers despite elevated US treasury yields and a stronger US dollar4 Movements in the INR are consistent with the strength of the underlying macrofundamentals and the reassuring availability of buffers Growth Drivers and Opportunities 7 As many business leaders are present here let me now dwell upon Indias growth drivers and the opportunities that lie ahead The Indian economy rebounded strongly from the COVIDinduced contraction of 58 per cent in 202021 to a growth of 91 per cent in 202122 and 72 per cent in 202223 Indias real GDP is expected to grow by 65 per cent in both 202324 and 202425 making it one of the fastest growing large economies in the world5 In fact India is already the third largest economy in the world in terms of purchasing power parity PPP Despite global slowdown the Indian economy has remained resilient and continued to grow due to its higher reliance on domestic demand which enabled the economy to weather multiple global headwinds Although India has made rapid strides in external openness through trade and financial channels and gained competitiveness its dependence on domestic demand provides a cushion against external shocks At the same time various structural reforms implemented in areas of banking taxation inflation management and manufacturing sector etc over the last few years have laid the foundation for sustainable and higher growth 8 We have moved from an era of twin deficit and twin balance sheet stress to the current period of twin balance sheet advantage6 While balance sheets of banks witnessed significant improvement on the back of improved asset quality and profitability corporates also display stronger financials having deleveraged their balance sheets The improved health of the banks and corporates is also reflected in their recent second quarter results of 202324 The corporate performance parameters based on 1501 listed nongovernment nonfinancial companies suggest strong growth in profitability and staff costs in Q2202324 The Reserve Banks latest industrial outlook survey indicates that business outlook further improved with manufacturing firms being optimistic about demand condition in Q3202334 Capacity utilisation CU in the manufacturing sector on a seasonally adjusted basis continues to trend up which augurs well for investment activity The continued thrust on capex by the government is also favourable for investment activity It is now for corporates and other businesses to evaluate the current situation and future potential of India and move forward 9 On the supply side the agriculture sector has kept good momentum over the last few years and its performance is expected to remain stable during 202324 despite uneven southwest monsoon and lower kharif production Production of foodgrains as well as horticulture have reached record levels year after year The diversification of exports both in terms of products and destinations is enhancing the economys capacity to withstand shocks The agricultural sector continues to provide employment to a large part of our workforce 10 There are however several challenges relating to productivity gaps water usage and irrigation facilities shifting consumer preferences and sudden weather events All these require heavy investments in infrastructure and innovation to modernise the agricultural sector and realise its true potential for achieving higher productivity more efficient access to markets maximising farmers income and increasing its contribution to GDP As a nation we must find a way of carrying out certain reforms especially in the area of agricultural marketing and the connected value chains These reforms are critical not only for sustained high growth but also for durable price stability and to mitigate the frequency and intensity of food price shocks It is important that private sector comes forward in a big way and becomes a crucial partner in this journey There are opportunities for the private sector to invest in strategic areas of agriculture and allied activities such as supply chains food processing involving variety of fruits vegetables and food grains scaling up dairy poultry and fishing and creating marketing infrastructure Private sector can accelerate farmfirm ie agriindustry linkage and improve the efficiency of the entire value chain right up to the end customer 11 As regards the manufacturing sector even as its share in the economy has been around 1718 per cent over the years it has potential to accelerate its contribution to growth and employment Indias demographic advantage with its young labour force also presents a unique opportunity to become a key player in global manufacturing It is important for us to be part of the global supply chains which are undergoing realignments in the fragmented global economy Initiatives like the productionlinked incentive PLI scheme create conducive conditions to enhance the share of manufacturing in our GDP Sectors such as smart phones largescale electronics pharma food processing auto and auto components have recorded good performance under the PLI scheme There is also huge potential in emerging areas such as aerospace and defence lowcarbon technologies electric vehicles and semiconductors Our efforts towards building robust public digital infrastructure which is fostering digitisation and ease of doing transactions across the spectrum will continue to provide strong fillip to technology adoption and productivity 12 At present the services sector contributes the largest share in Indias GDP and remains an anchor of overall growth The Indian services sector is fast adopting new technologies such as artificial intelligence internet of things cloud computing and data analytics to improve service delivery reach and competitiveness The newly emerging startups are also largely concentrated in the services sector There is a steady shift from lowskill consumeroriented services towards more technologyenabled business services Indeed there is a case for Indian businesses to recognise this undercurrent and work towards upscaling their activities to meet the external demand in this sector 13 In fact India commands a strong external position thanks to the strength of our services exports which have largely remained resilient They have supported Indias current account deficit even as merchandise exports have been under pressure in the face of weakening global demand The current account deficit to GDP ratio has remained under 2 per cent for almost 10 years Indias services exports are diversifying from information technology IT related services to other professional services such as business development research and development professional management accountancy and legal services 14 Overall Indias growth journey with active participation of manufacturing and services sectors and dependence on domestic demand could be selffulfilling in the years to come Some Reflections on Financial Sector Issues 15 Let me now turn to the financial sector As the Indian economy strives to grow in an evolving and uncertain global environment it is imperative that our financial sector remains strong The Indian banking system continues to be resilient backed by improved capital ratios asset quality and robust earnings growth The financial indicators of nonbanking financial companies NBFCs are also in line with that of the banking system as per the latest available data While banks and NBFCs are showing good performance now sustaining it requires concerted efforts In good times like these banks and NBFCs need to reflect and introspect as to where potential risks could possibly originate Now is the time for them to further strengthen their risk management practices and build additional buffers to face the situation if the business cycle turns adverse 16 On our part the Reserve Bank of India has significantly strengthened its regulation and the supervision of banks NBFCs and other regulated entities in recent years We have also very recently announced a few macro prudential measures in the overall interest of sustainability These measures are preemptive in nature They are calibrated and targeted It may be relevant to note that major growth drivers like loans for housing vehicles and MSME sector have been excluded from these measures We continue to focus on strengthening governance and assurance functions ensuring effective risk management and robust lending practices We are monitoring the supervised entities through various onsite and offsite tools stress testing vulnerability assessments thematic studies data dump analysis etc as part of our proactive and forwardlooking supervisory approach Banks NBFCs and other financial entities must continue to do stress testing of their books In fact there is a strong case for companies in the real sector also to stress test their businesses and balance sheets Many of them may already be doing so but it would be desirable that many more also do this 17 At the current juncture there may not be any immediate cause for worry but to remain on top of things Banks and NBFCs would be well advised to take certain precautionary measures In this context I would like to highlight four points 18 First while credit growth is accelerating in the current period banks and NBFCs may take due care to ensure that credit growth at the overall sectoral and subsectoral levels remain sustainable and all forms of exuberance are avoided Expansion of the credit portfolio itself and pricing of the same should be in sync with the risks envisaged Banks and NBFCs also need to further strengthen their asset liability management They may give greater attention to their liabilities side In certain cases we have observed increased reliance on high cost short term bulk deposits while the tenure of the loans both in retail and corporate loans is getting elongated 19 Second given the increasing importance of nonbank financial companies NBFCs in the financial system7 the increasing interconnectedness between banks and nonbanks merits close attention NBFCs are large net borrowers of funds from the financial system with their exposure from the banks being the highest Banks are also one of the key subscribers to the debentures and commercial papers issued by NBFCs NBFCs also maintain borrowing relationships with multiple banks simultaneously Needless to state that such concentrated linkages may create a contagion risk Though the banks are well capitalised they must constantly evaluate their exposure to NBFCs and the exposure of individual NBFCs to multiple banks The NBFCs on their part should focus on broad basing their funding sources and reducing overdependence on bank funding 20 Third microfinance has emerged as an important financial conduit to foster financial inclusion As Micro Finance Institutions MFIs are catering to the marginalised clientele they have to bear in mind the affordability and repayment capacity of the borrowers Though the interest rates are deregulated certain NBFCsMFIs appear to be enjoying relatively higher net interest margins It is indeed for micro finance lenders to ensure that the flexibility provided to them in setting interest rates is used judiciously They are expected to ensure that interest rates are transparent and not usurious 21 Fourth the increased collaboration of Banks and NBFCs with FinTechs is facilitating introduction of innovative products and services and new business models Digital technologies are offering a powerful medium to access banking and financial services This has also brought down the operational costs and helped in enhancing the reach of financial services providers An important aspect that merits attention in this context is with regard to modelbased lending through analytics Banks and NBFCs need to be careful in relying solely on preset algorithms as assumptions based on which the models are operated These models should be robust and tested and retested periodically They may require to be calibrated and recalibrated from time to time based on the changing contours of the financial ecosystem and fresh information It is necessary to be watchful of any undue risk build up in the system due to information gaps in these models which may cause dilution of underwriting standards Concluding Observations 22 We are living in highly uncertain times in an interconnected world New risks are emerging from time to time New sources of risk are also coming up In such a scenario building up further on resilience would be the best insurance against shocks and uncertainties This holds good for all businesses and financial entities As I see many banking and corporate leaders in the audience let me also stress that new opportunities are knocking at our doors It is for us to capitalise on them There has to greater focus on investment in capacity building skilling of human resources and adoption of newer technology by all players The international confidence on Indias prospects is at a new high it is an opportune time to make this Indias moment and work towards strong sustainable and inclusive growth Thank you Namaskar 1 Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry FICCI and Indian Banks Association IBA 2 Mooring of household inflation expectations has been underway since September 2022 Inflation expectations for three months ahead fell by 90 bps from 100 per cent July 2023 round to 91 per cent September 2023

scheduled commercial banks irrespective of their asset size and exposure Investment fluctuation reserves IFR have also been created in the banks Valuation guidelines on available for sale AFS category of investment are stringent and follow a conservative approach 4 As of November 20 2023 the INR had depreciated on calendar year basis by 07 per cent against the dollar performing well when compared to its EME peers including the Chinese yuan the Thailand baht the Vietnamese dong Argentine peso and the Malaysian ringgit It had appreciated by 124 per cent against the Japanese yen while it depreciated by 27 per cent against Euro and by 37 per cent against the UK pound 5 According to the International Monetary Fund IMF India will become the thirdlargest economy before 2030 with its GDP projected to surpass both Japan and Germany by 2026 and 2027 respectively India is already the third largest economy in the world in terms of purchasing power parity PPP with a share of 7 per cent of global GDP after China and the USA Source IMF World Economic Outlook WEO database 6 While twin deficit refers to the situation when an economy suffers from both the fiscal deficit and the current

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=56750,Date RBI Bulletin November 2023,Today the Reserve Bank released the November 2023 issue of its monthly Bulletin The Bulletin includes five speeches four articles and current statistics The four articles are I State of the Economy II Reading the Markets Mind Decoding Monetary Policy Expectations from Financial Data III Transitioning Indias Power Sector Repurposing of CoalFired Power Plants IV Monetary Policy Transmission in India Recent Dynamics I State of the Economy The global economy shows signs of slowing down in the final quarter of 2023 as manufacturing languishes while services sector activity appears to have reached the end of its postpandemic expansion Going forward tightening financial conditions is a significant risk to the global outlook In India the momentum of the change in GDP is sequentially expected to be higher in Q3202324 with festival demand remaining ebullient Investment demand appears to be resilient with the governments infrastructure spending an uptick in private capex automation digitalisation and indigenisation providing a boost Headline inflation came down to 49 per cent in October from the average of 67 per cent in 202223 and 71 per cent in JulyAugust 2023 II Reading the Markets Mind Decoding Monetary Policy Expectations from Financial Data By Joice John Bhimappa A Talwar Priyanka Sachdeva and Indranil Bhattacharyya This article uses the Overnight Index Swaps OIS rate to decode the nearterm market expectations of changes in the monetary policy rate during 2016 to 2023 Further this article also analyses the impact of anticipated and unanticipated changes in the policy rate on interest rates across market segments and maturities Highlights During 20162023 unanticipated changes in policy rate or monetary policy surprises have been rare suggesting that the RBIs communication has been effective in guiding market expectations The anticipated changes in policy rate are found to have no immediate impact on longer term interest rates as those were already factored in by the markets In contrast the few instances of monetary policy surprises had an instantaneous impact across market segments and maturities on the day of the policy announcement III Transitioning Indias Power Sector Repurposing of CoalFired Power Plants By Brij Raj and Amit Kumar As India navigates the dual challenge of balancing its growing energy demands with environmental sustainability this article explores the potential risks associated with stranded assets in the coal and fossil fuel sectors as well as their probable impact on banks and financial institutions FIs that have exposure to these sectors Highlights Globally there is an observable trend of tightening financing conditions for coal projects reflecting a heightened awareness of risks associated with the energy transition Repurposing coalfired power plants is a complex endeavor but emerging climate finance tools like coal transition mechanisms can expedite the shift towards cleaner energy despite being in a nascent stage Banks and FIs can contribute to the decarbonization of the power sector by improving their Environmental Social and Governance ESG practices and providing transition financing to help producers meet environmental and emission norms A balanced approach is recommended for a smooth transition from coal and fossil fuel financing considering Indias developmental requirements IV Monetary Policy Transmission in India Recent Dynamics By Yuvraj Kashyap Avnish Kumar Anand Prakash and Shubhangi Latey Against the backdrop of the shift in the monetary policy cycle this article reviews recent monetary policy transmission dynamics in India It estimates the degree of passthrough to lending and deposit rates and attempts to delineate the potential determinants of the passthrough Highlights The external benchmarkbased lending rate EBLR system of loan pricing calibrated normalisation of surplus liquidity and robust credit growth strengthened transmission during the current tightening phase although it is still not complete The transmission to term deposit rates has been strong while savings deposit rates have remained largely unchanged Therefore the pace of increase in deposit rates term deposits and savings account deposits taken together has lagged the pace of increase in lending rates in the current tightening cycle which is reflected in an improvement in NIMs of banks during 202223 An empirical banklevel analysis in a panel framework indicates that surplus liquidity in the banking system and a higher share of CASA deposits in total deposits has a softening impact on lending rates The passthrough to lending rates is found to be higher during the tightening cycle High creditdeposit CD ratio raises deposit and lending rates Surplus liquidity and excess SLR lower the passthrough to deposit rates The views expressed in the Bulletin articles are of the authors and do not represent the views of the Reserve Bank of India Yogesh Dayal Chief General Manager Press Release 202320241300

https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_SpeechesView.aspx?Id=1395,Date Emerging India A Land of Stability and Opportunities,I am delighted to participate in this symposium on Indian Economy organised by the Institute of Indian Economic Studies IIES Tokyo I understand this event is being organised by the IIES after a gap of 3 years due to the intervening period of the COVID19 pandemic Earlier this year in March 2023 Prof Sakakibara and Mr Sugaya had visited the Reserve Bank of India in Mumbai when we discussed about my participation in this symposium I would like to convey my sincere thanks and gratitude to Prof Sakakibara and the IIES for inviting me to participate in this event today 2 The global economy continues to face multiple macroeconomic and geopolitical shocks The prediction of a global recession has not come true but there are indications that global growth is slowing down amid tightening financial conditions and still elevated inflation Even as the fallouts of the pandemic the war in Ukraine and the unprecedented tightening of monetary policy reverberate across the world the recent developments in West Asia have added to the litany of challenges for the global economy Policymaking in this scenario becomes extremely challenging with difficult tradeoffs growth versus inflation price stability versus financial stability and current exigency versus future sustainability There is always a risk of doing too little or doing too much In such a scenario I would like to start with the Reserve Bank of Indias approach to policy making during this turbulent period Our Approach 3 To protect the economy from the relentless shocks in the recent period our endeavour has been to remain proactive pragmatic and prudent in our policy response We were conscious of the fact that an overdose of monetary medicine while relieving the pain in the short run could give rise to increased vulnerability and fragility over a period of time Following the onset of the COVID19 pandemic we injected liquidity but almost every measure of liquidity injection was for a limited period and was targeted By doing so we avoided the pitfall of a liquidity trap Further our lending standards were not diluted in terms of our counterparties banks and collateral requirements for onlending to stressed entities or sectors 4 On the regulatory side also our actions were measured We allowed lenders to offer moratorium on loan repayments and interest payments We put in place loan resolution frameworks for the COVID19 related stressed assets thereafter These loan resolution frameworks were not open ended but subject to achievement of certain financial and operational parameters The idea was to avoid the phenomenon of moral hazard and other pitfalls typically associated with open ended restructuring of loans 5 We are acutely aware that a healthy and efficient banking and financial system is the primary stabilising force against various shocks Mindful of this we have carried out a series of reforms in our regulatory and supervisory architecture We have come out with certain governance guidelines for banks and introduced a scalebased regulation for nonbank financial companies NBFCs based on the size and complexity of their businesses The process of supervision of banks NBFCs and other financial entities has also been substantially strengthened with the focus being on early detection and preemptive correction rather than reacting to the symptoms of weaknesses 6 Thanks to a confluence of factors including to a large extent the steps taken by the Reserve Bank the Indian economy has emerged as an epitome of stability and opportunity We have not only kept our house in order against large and overlapping global shocks but also improved our macroeconomic fundamentals and buffers While growth remains on track inflation is on a path of moderation though it is still above the target The balance sheets of banks and corporates are healthiest in a long time and with the public investment push by the Government they create favourable conditions for a sustained revival in investment Consumer confidence as evident from our surveys is on a rising trajectory since the pandemic lows Our external sector inspires confidence as we are reaping export opportunities in the services sector our current account deficit remains eminently manageable and we have bolstered our forex reserves to deal with potential eventualities 7 Today India has become the new engine of global growth with its young demography1 improving physical and digital infrastructure and above all an enabling policy environment In this context Japan and India continue to be the natural partners We share deep historical ties The teachings of Gautama Buddha have inspired our shared ethos and cultures We look up to the Japanese Economic Miracle as a learning opportunity as we prepare the ground to uplift Indias growth trajectory Japan has played a critical role in infrastructure building in India through several public and private sector partnerships2 There are many collaboration opportunities in frontier technologies such as space technology artificial intelligence quantum computing rareearths extraction semiconductors and resilient supply chains and other areas Our partnership could also be potentially strengthened in the sphere of human resources I am sure the future offers limitless possibilities to deepen our engagements for the benefit our people and the entire world 8 It would be worthwhile here to look a little deeper into Indias growth drivers its experience of managing inflation since the pandemic and the emerging opportunities and challenges especially in the FinTech space Growth Drivers 9 Policy focus on strengthening macroeconomic fundamentals and continued structural reforms have made India distinct in terms of growth outcomes This was reflected in the rebound in GDP growth after the pandemic from a contraction of 58 per cent in 202021 pandemic year to a growth of 91 per cent in 202122 and 72 per cent in 202223 The GDP grew by 78 per cent in the first quarter of 202324 and the available high frequency indicators suggest continuation of this momentum For the full year 202324 real GDP growth is projected at 65 per cent by the Reserve Bank 10 The innate resilience of the Indian economy could be attributed to its well diversified economic structure Although India has made rapid strides in external openness through trade and financial channels and gained competitiveness its core dependence for growth continues to be its domestic demand which also provides a cushion against external shocks Among the constituents of aggregate demand private consumption accounts for over half of GDP around 570 per cent average share during 201112 to 202223 followed by fixed investment and government consumption During the postpandemic recovery private consumption contributed an average of 660 per cent to GDP growth during 202122 and 2022233 At the same time structural reforms related to banking digitalisation taxation manufacturing etc have laid the foundation for a strong and sustainable growth over the medium and long term 11 On the supply side while the agricultural and the industrial sectors are maintaining their underlying momentum with renewed focus on manufacturing a major part of the Indias growth is coming from the services sector which again largely depends on domestic demand With crucial transformations underway Indias services sector is expected to lift its future trajectory of growth with a major impetus coming from rapid digitalisation of the economy which could be a gamechanger for economic development The external demand for Indias services is also increasingly gaining significance with services exports growing rapidly on the back of rising competitiveness in niche areas Indias services exports are diversifying from information technology IT related services to other professional services such as business development research and development professional management accountancy and legal services Domestic services are also undergoing a steady shift from lowskill consumeroriented services towards more technologyenabled business services The newly emerging startups are largely concentrated in the services sector Capitalising on Indias impressive public digital infrastructure4 many of these startups function as service providers for other businesses by offering services ranging from facilitating digitization and improving access to credit Managing Inflation 12 As in the case of growth there are some nuances in Indias experience in managing inflation visvis other countries The nature of inflation shocks throughout much of 2020 and 2021 in India were largely supply side shocks coming from COVID19 lockdowns and adverse weather events As lockdowns were withdrawn and the impact of weather disturbances waned forces of inflation correction began to operate The monetary and fiscal support provided during the pandemic were measured and targeted Consequently demandled inflation pressures in India were much less compared to several other economies The monetary policy committee MPC of the Reserve Bank was therefore able to look through the intermittent higher inflation prints with the aim of supporting economic growth during and in the aftermath of the COVID19 pandemic The MPC took the considered view that policy tightening in such a scenario would only accentuate the growth slowdown and impart higher volatility without being able to properly address the firstround effects of temporary supply side shocks This approach was in consonance with the flexibility embedded in our flexible inflation targeting framework wherein the primary objective of monetary policy is to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth 13 In early 2022 with the waning of COVID19 shocks on inflation gradual easing of supply bottlenecks and forecast of a normal monsoon inflation was expected to witness a significant moderation to the target rate of 4 per cent by Q3202223 These expectations were completely overturned by the war in Ukraine Initially the shocks came from the spike in global fuel and food prices which got further accentuated by local adverse weather events These shocks got transmitted to the retail prices of goods and services as domestic economic recovery and rising demand enabled passthrough of the large pentup input costs This also imparted stickiness to underlying core inflation The result was a generalized inflationary impulse 14 In the period that followed the Ukraine war in 2022 what stood out in India was the coordinated monetary and fiscal policy response to tame the inflationary pressures The MPC quickly changed gears by prioritising inflation over growth while changing its stance from being accommodative to withdrawal of accommodation in April 2022 The MPC then went on to increase the policy repo rate by 250 bps cumulatively between May 2022 and February 2023 to keep inflation expectations anchored break the core inflation persistence and contain second round effects 15 Looking back there were several aspects in our conduct of policy that helped in taking decisive and timely action during the heightened inflation pressures seen in 202223 First prudence was the cornerstone of the monetary policy response to the COVID19 shock with most of the extraordinary liquidity injection measures being targeted with preset end dates This ensured an orderly unwinding of the monetary stimulus as growth recovered Second the Government also adhered to fiscal prudence with actual fiscal deficit for 202223 kept in line with the Budget Estimates Third complementing the monetary policy measures were a series of proactive and targeted supply side measures by the Government5 All these factors put together proved to be critical in moderating the price pressures 16 As things stand today the MPC in its October 2023 meeting has projected CPI inflation at 54 per cent for 202324 a moderation from 67 per cent in 202223 Headline inflation however remains vulnerable to recurring and overlapping food price shocks The core inflation has also moderated by 170 basis points since its recent peak in January 2023 In these circumstances monetary policy remains watchful and actively disinflationary to progressively align inflation to the target while supporting growth FinTech Space 17 The advent of FinTechs has transformed the landscape of traditional financial services This has tremendously improved the delivery of financial services by making them faster cheaper efficient and more accessible India is currently the worlds third largest FinTech ecosystem in terms of the number of FinTechs operating in India It is growing at a robust pace and is projected to generate around US200 billion in revenue by the year 20306 contributing to approximately 13 per cent of the global FinTech industrys total revenue in 2030 The defining feature of the Indian model of digitisation is the lead taken by the Government and the Public Sector in building infrastructures on top of which innovative products are created by private sector FinTech firms and startups7 The JAM trinity a combination of bank accounts Jan Dhan Aadhaar Indias biometric identity system that provides a single and portable proof of identity and Mobile phone numbers has revolutionised Indias FinTech ecosystem in terms of financial inclusion digitisation of financial services and overall service delivery 18 On top of this the Unified Payments Interface UPI has played a phenomenal role in the FinTech revolution in India Its success story has in fact become an international model Its ability to instantly transfer money between bank accounts through mobile applications has transformed the way people make digital transactions The interoperability of UPI across banks and payments systems has created a unified payment ecosystem It has facilitated digital payments even for small businesses and street vendors leading to greater financial inclusion UPI has also spurred development of new payment related products and services8 Further linking of the UPI with fast payment systems of other countries is also being undertaken Linkage of fast payment systems of India and Japan may also be explored to leverage the power of fintech and make crossborder payments more efficient and less costly9 19 The Reserve Bank has also commenced pilot runs of Indias central bank digital currency CBDC the eRupee for specific use cases in both wholesale and retail segments Our approach to FinTech ecosystem is customercentric focus on good governance ensuring effective oversight ethical conduct and risk management and encouraging selfregulation by the FinTechs themselves through a SelfRegulatory Organization SRO 20 Although financial innovation enhances ease of payment and lowers its cost they also pose risks and challenges to the financial system These risks have a bearing on overall financial stability and market integrity We therefore intend to play a dual role of acting as promoter of innovation as well as being the regulator While promoting innovation our focus is on ensuring a wellregulated ecosystem that addresses systemic risks and challenges Concluding Observations 21 It is a matter of satisfaction that the Indian economy has sailed through the turbulent waters smoothly during the recent years Driven by its inherent dynamism and supported by a prudent policy mix growth is getting stronger foothold while inflation is also coming under control Our economic performance also owes a lot to the very calibrated focused and targeted monetary and fiscal responses since the pandemic 22 I must add that in the current uncertain environment it is best to avoid any sense of complacency We remain agile and continue to fortify our macroeconomic fundamentals and buffers Today the confidence and trust in Indias prospects are at an alltime high To seize the moment India looks at Japan as a close partner to usher in a new era of growth and prosperity for both our countries We will be celebrating the festival of lights Deepavali in a few days in India With Japan as our close partner I am sure the land of the rising sun will further light up our spirits to take our economies and wellbeing of our people to greater heights Thank you Namaskar 1 India is endowed with a great demographic dividend as 68 per cent of the total

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_SpeechesView.aspx?Id=1394,Date Towards A Greener Cleaner India Inaugural Address by Dr Michael Debabrata Patra Deputy Governor RBI at the New York Fed Central Banking Seminar organised by the Federal Reserve Bank New York on October 9 2023 at New York,Good Morning to you all I am delighted to be here again at the prestigious Annual Central Banking Seminar a flagship event of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for which it has earned global renown It is truly an honour to interact with central bankers from around the world our community of tomorrow You embody the theme of Indias G20 Presidency Vasudhaivya Kutumbakam the world is one family The Climate is Striking Back In my past interactions in this Seminar I have dwelled on macroeconomic stability price stability exchange rate stability financial stability all essentially issues centered around the core competence of conservative central bankers from which we are reluctant to stray After all central banks stand for stability Today however I will venture to address a theme which threatens to overwhelm all these aspects of stability the sum of all fears to borrow the name of a gripping 2002 movie starring Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman It is a theme about which several central banks have expressed reservations about engaging in order to avoid mission creep while others have expressed inability in view of lacking the instruments to deal with it The stark ominous reality is that the climate is striking back Central banks cannot be immune or inactive any longer Climate change is not new The earths climate has changed in the past and quite drastically The Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History has released findings about the earths temperature over the last 500 million years2 They show warm temperatures dominating most of the time with global temperatures repeatedly rising above 266 degree Celsius C and even above 32C much too warm for ice sheets or perennial sea ice In fact polar caps cannot exist when the temperature crosses 18C This is the fever line About 250 million years ago it was too hot for even swamps to exist In the last 100 million years global temperatures have peaked twice In fact during much of the Paleocene3 and early Eocene4 epochs 5556 million years ago the poles were free of ice caps and palm trees and crocodiles lived above the Arctic Circle About 60 million years ago the earths climate changed dramatically due to the devastating impact of a large asteroid colliding with the earth leading to the extinction of dinosaurs However one dinosaur survived the theropod group which included Trex It evolved into the birds that rule earths skies today Modern human civilisation which has developed over just the past 10000 years or so has seen a period of low temperatures and relative global climate stability Compared to most of the earths history this period has been cold at 148C known as the interglacial period5 The earths temperature has begun rising In September 2023 it averaged 164C degrees Celsius 175 degrees warmer than the preindustrial period of 18501900 World Meteorological Organisation WMO October 20236 The warming up of the climate can have cataclysmic consequences Climate Catastrophes Paralysing Earth Climate change is manifesting itself at an alarming scale and pace globally undermining livelihoods infrastructure and endangering health food energy and water security Humanity is imperilled and so is the future of the planet According to the World Meteorological Organisation WMO the period 201522 has been the warmest on record In the Northern hemisphere this years summer has been the hottest on record and the year 2023 is on its way to becoming the hottest ever7 Climatic disasters are occurring more frequently and across the globe The world recorded its warmest September on record in 2023 In the European Alps glacier melt records were broken in 2022 Switzerland lost about 6 per cent of its glacier ice volume For the first time in history there was no accumulation of fresh ice even at the very highest measurement sites according to the WMO Sea levels increased by about 5 millimetres during January 2021 August 2022 due to increasing ice melt During 2022 58 per cent of the ocean surface experienced at least one marine heat wave There was a drop in the Antarctic Sea ice extent to 192 million km2 which was the lowest level on record and was almost 1 million km2 below the longterm average This has been associated with increasing global surface temperatures droughts storms dangerous floods and heat waves of increased intensity and frequency around the world India faced its hottest February in 2023 since recordkeeping began in 19018 In March large parts of the country experienced hailstorms and torrents of unseasonal rain leading to extensive damage to standing crops According to Indias Centre for Science and Environment CSE the country experienced extreme weather events on 314 of 365 days of 2022 which claimed 3026 lives affected 196 million hectares of crop area and 423249 houses and killed over 69899 animals9 In 2023 April witnessed a recordbreaking heat wave in India and other parts of Asia May was the warmest since 1850 June and July were the hottest on record and August was the driest for India since 190110 In sharp contrast to the world India experienced among its wettest Septembers in 2023 This Time is Different Although temperature increases have been recorded during the course of earths history as I mentioned earlier the current episode of anthropogenic climate change is qualitatively different from the historical experience First changes in the earths climate that are underway are largely humaninduced as noted earlier while the earlier incidences were primarily the result of various natural factors Second the pace of climate change during the current phase is remarkably rapid it is unfolding over decades whereas earlier occurrences of climate change happened over centuries and millennia Third costs involved in the policy responses for adaptation to and mitigation of climate change related challenges are unprecedented Fourth the current experience with climate change is truly global in nature with accentuated regional implications Climate scientists recognise three anthropogenic or humaninduced drivers of climate change green house gas GHG emissions aerosols and land use and land cover Estimates show that the contribution of humancaused global surface temperature increase is 107C during 20102019 relative to 18501900 levels almost the entire increase in global temperature during this period11 The rise in extreme weather events has also increased the economic costs associated with such events Measuring Climate Change In order to comprehend what is going on and respond effectively it is important to first measure the phenomenon of climate change Climate scientists use many physical indicators including atmospheric oceanic and cryospheric to assess climate change only some of which I shall elaborate on in the interest of time Global mean surface temperature the average of land surface temperature LST and sea surface temperature SST apart from the secular rise in LST more than 90 per cent of the net energy or heat increase in the climate system is stored in oceans and over 60 per cent in the upper ocean 0700 metres In fact the heat absorbed in the upper layer of the ocean has increased causing thermal expansion melting of glaciers and ice caps rise in sea level and ocean acidification Each decade is becoming warmer than the previous one by around 02C since the 1980s The rise in surface temperatures is increasing evaporation which in turn is causing more overall precipitation and more frequent and more intense storms and floods On account of the unequal pattern of precipitation wet areas are getting wetter while dry land is becoming drier Uncertain rainfall patterns have increased the frequency of droughts and floods Unlike land or water surface ice reflects almost all the solar energy that falls on it When snow or ice melts in response to a rise in temperature it exposes open water or land surface that absorbs solar energy and raises temperature further in the atmosphere Furthermore the melting of glaciers and ice adds to sea level expansion Moreover snow and ice are potential sources of fresh water supply required for ecosystems agriculture recreation and livelihoods Losses of snow cover glaciers ice sheets and sea ice lead to increases in absorbed solar radiation and this in turn causes further warming as well as turbulent heat fluxes at the surface The cumulative glacier mass loss since the beginning of 1970 is more than 25 meters of water equivalent mwe The strong increase in ice glacier decline rates in each decade until the present day leaves no doubt about ongoing climate change While each indicator has its own relevance in explaining climate change the totality of what we face warrants a composite indicator that has been developed by using 11 key physical indicators12 in a dynamic factor model DFM framework The DFM extracts an unobserved or latent common factor from these indicators We call it the global climate change index or GCCI It shows an upward trend since the late 19th century following the Industrial Revolution The correlation between the GCCI and the total number of extreme weather events is 09 indicating a rise in the frequency of disaster events with climate change With the current state of climate policy action emissions an average of 38 giga tons of carbon dioxide equivalent will result in a rise in global temperature by 27C over the preindustrial average by 2100 Even if all pledges and targets announced so far are incorporated associated with an average 102 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent the global rise in temperature can reach a minimum of 19C above preindustrial levels under the most optimistic path of global emission reduction In order to achieve net zero by 2070 and the global temperature increase of 15 degrees Celsius emissions have to be reduced much lower Climate Change Global Actions Climate change has moved to the centre stage of the global public policy debate today While the growing recognition of the adverse effects of climate change has led to some recent actions that are weakening the correlation between carbon emissions and GDP growth globally an absolute decoupling is yet to happen Climate change can affect price stability through supply shocks such as food and energy shortages and through a decline in productive capacity Demand shocks can arise due to the loss of wealth of firms and households on account of frequent natural disasters Physical and transition risks can affect the balance sheets of financial institutions and banks limiting the flow of credit to the real economy These destructive forces interact with each other to form vicious feedback loops Hence almost all countries have committed to timelines for the transition to net zero emissions with the majority committing to achieve this target by 2050 While 23 per cent of the countries have made the target a legal obligation 18 per cent have proposed to make it into a legal obligation and the remaining 59 per cent have made their pledges in official policy documents All these countries together account for around 73 per cent of global CO2 emissions 59 countries have proposed actions or are in discussions Climate Change and India The Indian subcontinent has a diverse topography ranging from the snowclad Himalayas in the north the youngest and tallest mountains in the world fertile plains the worlds largest delta in the east the Thar desert in the northwest and a long coastline of more than 7500 kilometres Consequently the country is intrinsically exposed to different temperature and precipitation patterns More recently however India is becoming vulnerable to extreme weather events Coastal cities which are among the most densely populated regions of the world are becoming increasingly prone to cyclones flooding and salinisation of farmlands and freshwater supplies The Indian subcontinent receives about 75 per cent of its annual rainfall during the southwest monsoon SWM season from June to September This rainfall is crucial for the summer cropping season Over time the southwest monsoon SWM pattern has subtly changed with a rise in average annual rainfall At the same time dry periods have become more common while intense wet spells have also increased Overall risks to agricultural production and food price volatility have both increased significantly The past decade 20112021 has been the warmest on record with 11 of the 15 hottest years in India since 1901 the years 2022 and 2021 are ranked as the fifth and sixth warmest years respectively since 1901India Meteorological Department Extreme weather events including unseasonal rainfall cyclones and heatwaves have become more frequent Indias Energy Requirements The sectoral composition of Indias GDP is skewed towards services 60 per cent which is emissionlight with a relatively lower energy intensity of output a natural lid on emissions Although emissions from the industrial sector 16 per cent are higher the emission intensity of agriculture which involves both energy related emissions and nonenergy related emissions is in fact higher than certain industries such as textiles machinery and equipment as well as construction activity Energy production drives around threequarters of global GHG emissions In terms of the overall energymix fossil fuelbased energy sources viz coal oil and natural gas continue to dominate energy consumption in India The share of coal in Indias electricity production is around 70 per cent World Energy Outlook 2021 The War against Emissions The energy intensity of the economy is being reduced by moving from fossil to nonfossil fuels adopting energy efficiency measures employing new and improved technologies and increasing productivity The International Energy Agency IEA states that Indias energy intensity of GDP has been declining at an average rate of 3 per cent per year during the last three decades to 025 tonnes of CO2 per 1000 US dollars in 2021 indicating relative decoupling since the 1991 peak The Climate Change Performance Index CCPI published annually since 2005 by German Watch a nonprofit nongovernmental organisation that lobbies for sustainable development is an independent monitoring tool for tracking countries climate protection performance It increases transparency in national and international climate policy and enables comparison of individual countries climate protection efforts and progress India is among the high performing countries in the index India earns a high rating in the GHG emissions and energy use categories with a medium rating for climate policy and renewable energy The country is on track to meet its 2030 emissions targets compatible with a wellbelow 2C scenario Since the last CCPI India has updated its Nationally Determined Contributions NDCs and announced a net zero target for 2070 Green Initiatives in India By July 2023 renewable energy including hydro installed capacity stood at 177 giga watts GW accounting for 42 per cent of total installed capacity but renewable energy accounts for only 272 per cent of total generation Indias clean energy target is 500 GW by 2030 Capacity under construction is around 80 GW taking the total available capacity to about 250 GW The required capacity addition is another 250 GW by 2030India needs to add 25 GW of renewable energy capacity annually for the next eight years which would involve an investment of US 15 to 16 billion 125000 crore This implies that renewable energy including hydro installed capacity should increase at a rate of 164 per cent Globally the sales of electric vehicles EVs have crossed the 10 million mark in 2022 with a yearonyear yoy growth of 55 per cent The share of EVs in total new sales is rising rapidly in India and sales have crossed 1 million in 2022 Estimated GHG Emissions Under Alternative Growth Scenarios Emerging market and developing countries including India face a tradeoff they must continue to prioritise growth aspirations while pursuing climate related nationally determined goals Scenarios have been developed on Indias roadmap to net zero by 2070 conditional on different assumptions for real GDP growth the share of green energy in total energy demand and energy intensity of GDP In the baseline scenario the Indian economy grows at the rate of 66 per cent per year which is its average growth rate over the last decade but without taking actions to fulfil its environmental commitments A decline in energy usage per unit of economic activity by 23 per cent annually is assumed with steady carbon sequestration at 03 gigatonnes This scenario is associated with increasing emissions An alternate scenario retains the GDP growth assumption of 66 per cent per year It focuses on meeting immediate NDC objectives like reducing emission intensity and raising renewable energys share to 50 per cent in electricity generation by 2030 Achieving net zero emissions by 2070 would require even more energy efficiency with energy intensity declining to 50 per cent by 2070 Green energys share should reach 70 per cent by 2070 Under this scenario greenhouse gas emissions peak by 203233 and India reaches net zero by 2070 Energy consumption in 2070 is projected to be 18 times the level of 202122 compared to 72 times in the baseline scenario but it will be difficult to maintain the longterm growth rate of 66 per cent A second alternate scenario assumes that India would achieve annual real GDP growth of 96 per cent between 202324 to 204748 which is required for it to become an advanced economy by 2047 With respect to climate goals however the assumptions in this scenario are the same as in the baseline Higher growth would translate into even higher energy requirements and emissions The total primary energy requirement and net GHG emissions are estimated to be 125 times and 105 times higher respectively than their levels in 202122 The best scenario assuming a GDP growth of 96 per cent per annum over the period 202348 while adhering to the NDC commitments will require more aggressive efforts than the current NDC targets involving sharper declines in energy intensity and a higher proportion of green energy Energy intensity which has been steadily declining since the 1990s needs to decrease by 54 per cent annually and green energys share must rise to around 82 per cent by 2070 Energy consumption in 2070 would be 31 times higher than in 202122 Indias aspiration to become an advanced economy by 2047 would need to take into account these considerations India COP 26 and 27 In 2021 at COP26 India presented Panchamrit of Indias climate action Reach 500 GW nonfossil energy capacity by 2030 50 per cent of its energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030 Reduction of total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes from now to 2030 Reduction of the carbon intensity of the economy by 45 per cent by 2030 over 2005 levels Achieving the target of net zero emissions by 2070 India participated in COP27 in 2022 at Sharm El Sheikh Egypt with a focus on mainstreaming the theme of LiFE Lifestyle for Environment It highlighted the theme of LiFE everyone can contribute within ones capacity Green Initiatives by the RBI There is a growing recognition that even if governments are the most influential agency for climate change central banks and financial sector regulatorssupervisors are going to become the major stakeholders because 1 financial institutions play a key role in intermediation and hence have a more direct role in addressing climate change and 2 climate change is impacting the achievement of their mandates of price and financial stability In December 2007 the Reserve Bank mandated Corporate Social Responsibility Sustainable Development and Nonfinancial Reporting Role of Banks highlighting the importance of global warming and climate change in the context of sustainable development In 2015 loans for generation of renewable energy and public utilities run on nonconventional energy were made part of directed priority sector lending by banks In April 2021 the RBI joined the Network for Greening the Financial System NGFS to benefit from and contribute to the best practices in climate risk management and green finance In January 2022 the RBI conducted a Survey on Climate Risk and Sustainable Finance to assess the status of climate risk and sustainable finance in leading scheduled commercial banks In JanuaryFebruary 2023 the RBI issued sovereign green bonds worth US 22 billion 16000 crore in two tranches to mobilise resources for the Government for green infrastructural investments In April 2023 the RBI introduced a Framework for Acceptance of Green Deposits from June 01 2023 Conclusion Central banks generally pursue a relatively narrow mandate focused on stability Climate change is certainly not a part of it At least till now Yet as more evidence accumulates that climate change is overwhelming the earth due to human activity we cannot remain silent spectators So in the RBI we began from scratch and immersed ourselves in the economics of climate change Uncharacteristically we pooled all that we could gather on the climate and put it into our flagship publication The Report on Currency and Finance This is our small contribution towards a greener cleaner India To conclude climate change threatens to overwhelm the earth but we can reverse it because we have induced it The time to act is now on several fronts Development and climate change are not necessarily pitted in a trade off sustainable development is key The climate is a global public good global action is needed for humanity to live in harmony with our planet And it is in our hands Thank you 1 Inaugural Address delivered by Michael

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_SpeechesView.aspx?Id=1393,Date Governor Shri Shaktikanta Dass interaction during the Business Line Changemaker of the Year Award to Reserve Bank of India on November 3 2023 Edited excerpts,Raghuvir Srinivasan Editor Business Line Recognition of the Reserve Banks adroit handling of monetary policy and regulations over the last three years especially since the interest rate cycle turned a year and a half ago I would like to ask you two or three questions very quickly The first is you will go down in history as the only Governor of the Reserve Bank of India who had the job to guide the country and the economy during a calamity that the country faced Now I would like to understand your thought process when you were so super active during the COVID period The moment COVID was announced you opened up communication with the markets and with the press very quickly going in front of the cameras and addressing people Now what was your thought process when you went through that difficult period helming the RBI Shaktikanta Das Good evening and thank you Raghuvir Ji for asking me that question But before that with the permission of the dignitaries I would like to say that I am receiving this award on behalf of more than 13000 employees and officers of the Reserve Bank of India During the most turbulent period when we had multiple crises coming one after the other and some of the crises overlapping with each other it was teamwork at its best in the Reserve Bank of India I am receiving this with a sense of deep gratitude and it is a great honour for us from the Reserve Bank of India to receive this award I would like to thank the members of the jury the Hindu Business Line for conferring this award on the Reserve Bank I would also like to thank the Honorable Minister for being here to give this award and before I move to a reply to the question I would just like to draw a reference to what the Managing Director Amul said about two people being visible on the road in the morning now what was invisible at that time was that they were either carrying cash or their mobile through which they were making digital payments That is something on which a great amount of the share of that work goes to the Reserve Bank of India But coming back to your question when COVID hit and before the lockdown was announced by the Honorable Prime Minister we already had reports that this was going to be a kind of major crisis which the world has not seen What we had done was that even before the lockdown was announced we had set up a quarantine facility with about 200250 of our employees and service providers We hired a hotel on the outskirts of Mumbai We converted one of our large data centres into a quarantine facility We hired a bus which was also quarantined These members of the staff were put in that quarantine facility and all money market operations whether it is a debt market or the other segments of the money market have to function 365 days 24x7 so we had housed all these activities in a quarantine facility and ensured the continuity of the money market operations I would like to mention here that this facility continued for more than one year and our senior officers including myself kept on talking to them through the video facility because it was at the beginning of the pandemic The Honorable Prime Minister announced the lockdown on March 25 but we had set up this quarantine facility 45 days before that After two or three months when I asked the employees through the video conference I understand that you have problems we are looking after your family members Do not worry your family members are our responsibility We had given that confidence but after three months when I asked them how many of you would like to go back to your families because I understand that you have been there for three months so we would like to change please take it from me Almost all of them said Sir we will continue That is the kind of dedication Throughout this period of the entire teamwork in the RBI many of these suggestions came What was challenging right at the beginning was that we had decided to close down our office We myself the deputy governors and some of the senior officers decided that let us not wait for a problem to arise and then respond to it Let us try and anticipate problems and announce measures The first set of measures we announced on the 27th of March thereafter almost every month we were announcing new measures to deal with the emerging challenges If I can just sum it up and capture in three words our endeavour was to be proactive to be decisive and to weigh the risks in full Somebody was asking me just now whether we were encouraging our team members to discuss that if we are going to take a particular innovative measure what can be the worst possible consequence of it What can be the worst downside of it and then we were weighing whether the worst consequence of our decision whether it is something worth the risks whether it is something which we can manage or it is something uncontrollable The moment we were convinced that something was still manageable even if there was a 20 chance that we would be able to manage the worst possible consequences then we were decisive and we took that risk and announced those measures So our endeavour was to be proactive endeavour was to be decisive and endeavour was also to weigh all possible risks before making the decision I am happy to mention that the entire RBI team rose to the occasion The crisis period is not over We are still having other challenges coming up every day but I would like to say in this august gathering that the RBI remains committed to maintain the financial stability of our country to ensure that the economy continues to do well Raghuvir Srinivasan That is an amazing story I am sure every single person here will join me in thanking you from their hearts You and your staff who put themselves at risk during the COVID period and went away from their families for the cause of the nation They are no less than the armed forces soldiers of this country Congratulations and thanks The second question I would like to go to is you are an exbureaucrat a seasoned person who has held very high positions in the government and now you are the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India How has been the transformation from being a bureaucrat to a central banker Did having been a bureaucrat help you in understanding the governments thinking or when a Finance Ministry official or a Ministry say something to understand where they are coming from so you had prior intelligence on how the mind works Was that a help to you Shaktikanta Das What matters is the overall understanding of the economy The government whether it is the Finance Ministry or the overall government their objective is to do something good for the economy and this is the case everywhere in the world central banks across the world also have a responsibility to the economy and to the financial sector Both institutions are working for the people of the country and the welfare of the country So there has to be proper coordination and proper exchange of views between the government and the central bank everywhere I have always believed that good cooperation between the central bank and the government is absolutely essential to ensure that policy measures whether taken by the government or by the central bank are effective I can tell you that there has been excellent coordination and cooperation between the government and the central bank There was a thinking in some parts of the world that the government and the central banks should function in watertight compartments Now there is a growing realization that each of these institutions needs each other In the central bank we need the support of the government to make many legislative changes and amendments to the Reserve Bank of India Act giving us additional powers to regulate the cooperative banks to regulate the NBFC sector So we need certain additional powers for which we go to the government to get the acts amended The government also needs the support of the central bank to deal with the kind of crisis we faced in our country the fallout of COVID the fallout of the Ukraine war the inflation and other things What perhaps might have helped me is that I have seen both sides I had prior knowledge of how the Reserve Bank works because while being in the government I was a member of the Central Board of the Reserve Bank The fact that I was earlier in government and also had some idea about the Reserve Banks functioning and then moved to RBI which did help me Somebody may say that you were trying to keep both your feet in two separate boats but it is not so The idea is that even if you have your one foot here and other foot there in my case of course it was not both my feet were in one boat when I went to the Reserve Bank of India You must know how the other wheel of the system is moving so that there is coordination That is something which might have helped in my case But ultimately I would give the credit to the teamwork at the Reserve Bank of India and I say with all seriousness that there has been a fantastic and great contribution of many of my colleagues in the Reserve Bank to what the Reserve Bank as an institution has been able to achieve Raghuvir Srinivasan Perfect The Reserve Bank is a standing example of an institution of excellence in this country There is one If I had asked you three important qualities that a central banker should have what would those be Shaktikanta Das These are questions which should be asked when one demits office But since you have asked let me try and reply The first is to have a strong common sense That applies to every responsibility and more so for a central banker It is essential to have that strong common sense and to be able to visualise how monetary policy measures or other regulatory or financial sector measures are going to affect the real economy That is something which a strong common sense can give A strong common sense can confide that is the first requirement Second of course is the capability to keep an open mind keep your eyes open ears open and have the capacity also to smell a crisis I keep on telling my colleagues in the RBI that it is not just enough that we keep an open mind listen to everyone and keep our eyes and ears open It is a challenge for each of us easier said than done One must try and develop the capacity to smell a crisis before it comes up Now this may sound very esoteric and philosophical but essentially what I am trying to say is that there should be capacity to anticipate a potential problem a potential challenge and be ready to deal with it be ready to defend the financial sector and the institutions And the third will be a general point the teamwork especially for the leadership of any institution like the Reserve Bank of India which is spread all over the country We have regional offices everywhere and there is a lot of talent available down the road Internally within the organisation there should be active consultation and decisionmaking should be a kind of collective process in which the leader of course takes the final decision but each decisionmaking should be the outcome of a collective process These are the three aspects which I would like to mention Raghuvir Srinivasan Thank you One last question I cannot help but ask you this Shaktikanta Das Do not ask me about the next monetary policy other than that you can ask me anything Raghuvir Srinivasan If you notice I have stayed away from anything that is sensitive This question is about your style For every monetary policy statement we can see that you end with a quote from Mahatma Gandhi Now what is the thought process behind that You affect a 50basis points hike and then end with a Mahatma Gandhi quote So what is the thought process behind that Shaktikanta Das I will tell you how it started When the COVID pandemic started lockdown was announced There was a lot of anxiety among the people The anxiety was not just in the financial markets among the major players in our economy there was a lot of anxiety among the people A lot of people were shaken out there All of us just did not know where it was going to end what kind of damage it would cause to us how the family members and all of us were going to come out of it and when it would end So there was that kind of anxiety all over the world It was not just in India but all over the world So it was necessary to give confidence to the markets and give confidence to the people That is the time when we started making these monetary policy statements on television for half an hour Before that the monetary policy statement was about 15 minutes but we made it half an hour because there was no other communication There was no other interaction Just a few of us were attending the office all communications through the television through the YouTube channel of the RBI which many television channels picked up It was necessary to give confidence to the markets and the people We devised some of our own formulations If you refer to the earlier policy statements some statements we devised on our own and they have been accepted Some of us while discussing came across some quotations from Mahatma Gandhi which I recalled and some of my colleagues also recalled We found that they were very appropriate for that particular occasion I am not able to remember exactly the full words but it was like When the horizon is dark it is faith that keeps you going We started giving things like that and we found that it worked The feedback that we got from the market from others is that it really worked Initially it started with a sense of giving confidence to the markets and give confidence to the people and what better than using a quote from Mahatma Gandhi Since it worked we have continued with that thereafter There are appropriate quotes from Mahatma Gandhi for almost every occasion and there are quite a few of us in the RBI who have read Mahatma Gandhi to a great extent so we have some idea about it Raghuvir Srinivasan Thank you so much Sir Thanks for this session and my hearty congratulations to you and thank you once again for helming the country so well at the Reserve Bank Shaktikanta Das Thank you

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_SpeechesView.aspx?Id=1391,Date Reflections Challenges in Regulations,Ladies gentlemen and distinguished guests It is indeed a pleasure to be participating in this summit a gathering that is engaged to distill the essence of responsible stewardship in the corporate world Keeping up with the theme of this session The Challenge of Regulation I will reflect a bit on the dynamic landscape of regulations and regulation making its evolving nature and on the transformation underway in the financial sector Later I will also outline a few challenges and dilemmas encountered by the regulators in framing appropriate regulations to manage these transitions Do we need Regulations Many believe that minimal regulations is the best way to foster growth of the enterprise But history is replete with the examples of how minimal regulation coupled with lenient supervision and restrained enforcements have often led to financial crises In fact we would all agree that nothing could be more damaging to sustainable growth than a misfiring banking and financial sector While in an ideal scenario the invisible hand would ensure that the system functions flawlessly for the greater good with minimal regulatory oversight in reality it does not happen that way As such to control the irrational exuberance in the financial sector there is need for a regulator who sets the boundaries and also enforces them for ensuring a sound and robust set of financial institutions and there by promotes financial stability Regulations usually impose restrictions on the entry and operations of the entity while controlling the what and how of the business that is undertaken This process imposes opportunity cost on regulated entities to achieve the desired objectives However these are distributable costs to deliver a collective good Therefore regulations ensure that the overall financial system fulfils its supportive role to the real sector through efficient financial intermediation and its remains stable robust and responsive Moreover financial sector and banking industry is special The inherent ability of banks to generate leverage and the potential to trigger a domino effect in the financial system makes it unique Further banks are not just the custodians of the customers hardearned savings but also custodians of public trust It is RBIs responsibility to ensure that the trust reposed by the customers and depositors on banks is resolutely upheld Managing Transitions As we look at the challenges in the financial sector today it becomes important to address the profound structural shifts that are transforming the shape of the financial sector These transitions encompass a myriad of factors each with its own set of unique challenges These are also complex multifaceted issues that demand nuanced adaptable solutions Striking the right balance between encouraging innovation and maintaining the stability and security of the financial sector is always a formidable task Let me elaborate on few of such transitions which we are engaged with Climate Transition We are all aware of the global challenge that climate change poses to our planet and its impact which is felt across the world The transition to a more sustainable environmentally responsible financial sector is no longer an option but an imperative As societies demand greater commitment towards a cleaner greener environment regulators must undertake the task of integrating climate risks into the regulatory frameworks Ensuring that financial institutions consider the environmental impact of their actions while simultaneously managing the flow of credit demands a delicate balancing act and requires collaborative solutions The moot question which the regulators have to deliberate on is whether climate risk is a unique risk that need to be captured separately and thus requires a separate framework on a standalone basis or whether it transverses across credit market and operational risks and can be captured as a part of the existing risk frameworks Another point of debate is whether these risks need to be captured as combination of pillar 2 supervisory review and pillar 3 market discipline and disclosures requirements or is it better to capture the risk as part of pillar 1 capital and liquidity straight way Technology Transition Technology is reshaping the landscape of finance at an unprecedented pace and has emerged as a transformative force reshaping operations and customer experiences alike Digitalisation is helping to enlarge the options available to customers and lenders increase efficiency and competition in the provision of financial services and more importantly making these services available to larger segments of the population As we embrace these technological advancements it is imperative that regulatory frameworks evolve in tandem to ensure the security privacy and integrity of financial system In an era defined by data the protection of personal and financial information has come the fore In India the Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 DPDP Act has been recently enacted Such a legislation was necessary for safeguarding individuals rights and ensuring responsible handling of personal data Banks and other financial institutions as custodians of vast volumes of sensitive customer data must make the required efforts to adhere to the provisions of the Act and related regulations To manage this transition smoothly financial institutions must invest in robust data governance frameworks ensuring that they and their data processors collect process and store data in complete adherence to the law and the regulations Managing the transition to a more dataconscious and data cultured institution necessitates treading a delicate path The Digital Intermediation Transition Post the pandemic digital lending and emergence of digital platforms providing loans has seen an exponential rise in various emerging economies including India While this led to an increase in scale and velocity of credit in an increasingly digital environment it has raised a host of business conduct issues The questions for any regulator to consider are whether they should try to be ahead of the curve to ensure that financial innovations are enabled only after putting in place an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework or to follow a relaxed approach of allowing the markets to develop on its own By being more accommodating do the regulators then run the risk of having to deal with unanticipated business conduct concerns and in extreme cases confront and deal with potential events that could trigger systemic risks which may lead to outcomes that are difficult to anticipate and manage Nonetheless for a regulator inaction can never be an option The pace with which newer business models players and products are coming up with such entities often exploiting the gaps in existing regulations or conducting business operations that fall in a regulatory grey area continues to be a challenge The business models that are built to challenge the regulatory perimeters aggressive marketing strategies and those that are engaged in exploitation of gullible customers makes it clear that such issues need intervention But the dilemma lies in deciding the extent of regulatory intervention which will contain and restrict the customer abuse without significantly altering the nature of FinTech led innovation For example in the beginning of 2020 the lending activities of the new technology driven platforms involved small ticket size loans granted to a large number of borrowers mostly falling in the lower income strata of the society such as students retail businesses gig workers etc For these borrowers taking a loan at an exorbitant interest rate meant falling into a vicious debt trap What made the situation worse was the fact that borrowers were not even aware of such high interest rate or charges before taking the loan as these were not disclosed upfront there was no interface except the mobile app to raise their grievances and the recovery practices were harsh and unorthodox We had also observed that right from credit underwriting to recovery every activity was being outsourced with scant regard to customer privacy and protection Digital Lending was operating on a rent an RE model where the FinTech platform was undertaking all the lending activities on behalf of the regulated entity by posing itself as principal In many cases the customers were not even aware of the name of the bank or NBFC which had sanctioned the loan To tackle this issue the regulatory stance has converged on regulating the digital lending activity and the arrangements between regulated entities and FinTechs providing specified services to REs which were rechristened as Lending Service Proivers or LSPs RBIs digital lending regulations have laid down a broad regulatory framework under which FinTechs can become enabling partners with regulated entities These guidelines are a mix of reiteration of the extant guidelines like reporting to CICs conducting due diligence before engaging LSPs etc and some fresh ones with REs being the fulcrum around which digital lending activities are required to operate with the regulatory compliance being made their responsibility The Social Media Transition Social media has revolutionized the speed and scope of dissemination of information Information sharing has never been so quick and unhindered thus far But this also means that unsubstantiated rumors and false news can also spread equally quickly and can adversely affect financial institutions especially banks The recent banking turmoil in USA has jolted some of the widely held views regarding principles of liquidity management and nature and speed of bank runs The banking turmoil in the United States and Europe in early March 2023 has had a significant impact on the global financial system This episode has highlighted the need for a reassessment of global standards in financial sector regulations This episode has offered two important lessons First the trust is vulnerable to perceptions of weaknesses and misinformed social media commentary Second that in an age of social media and internet banking the speed with which bank runs occur is unprecedented and therefore the response time to handle any such crisis has telescoped to a fraction of what was hitherto considered acceptable To address these challenges constant and effective supervision complemented by ability of the bank concerned to monitor and prevent spread of misinformation over social media has become vital How is RBI Managing these Transitions RBIs approach has always been to foster and support innovations and dynamism while balancing it with financial stability considerations Therefore let me elaborate what are we doing to manage these transitions Simplifying Regulations The regulatory instructions have evolved over a period of time in consonance with the developmental trajectory of the financial system and institutions The regulatory perimeter has also expanded as the Indian financial system has ventured into newer business models product lines and geographical territories Over time this may have led to certain regulations becoming complex with concomitant increase in compliance burden Therefore a periodic stocktake is useful to review the regulatory instructions and compliance procedures with a view to streamlining rationalising them and making them more effective The RBI had setup Regulations Review Authority 20 RRA in 2021 following the RRA 1 set up in 1999 to undertake this task and ensuring simplicity of regulations that has become a priority for us In my view future regulations must be responsive to the evolving need of the financial system For this to happen we have adopted a fivepillar strategy First we are making sure that future regulations are forward looking and proactive Second we have become nimble in our approach This is critical as the pace of change has accelerated Third our approach to regulation making has become more data driven and impact assessment oriented This in turns has led to a more analytical decision making process and is helping in making provision for a suitable path for transition wherever warranted Fourth we have been adopting a more consultative approach to regulation making Prior consultation with stakeholders enables us to gather diverse viewpoints and incorporate them in the regulations This also makes implementation of regulations better The fifth and last pillar is collaboration We are engaging more and more with stakeholders government and with other regulators and industry to evolve a safe and resilient financial sector The Reserve Bank has been conferred upon the powers to make subordinate legislation under a wide spectrum of statutes This casts a responsibility upon RBI to ensure that its instructions are within the perimeters set by the statutory mandate clear in language appropriate and proportional Therefore we have increased our focus on providing suitable training and skills to our officers so that the regulations can be written in simple language and there is better clarity on the regulatory intent Bringing customer conduct into focus In whole scheme of things the customer should and must remain the centre The two primary objectives of regulation viz ensuring financial stability and protecting customer interest leads to two broad categories of regulations prudential regulations and conduct regulations Prudential regulation builds foundation for financial stability while conduct regulation lays the ethical foundation for maintaining customer trust together help in safeguarding the integrity of our financial system Accordingly our endeavour has been to inculcate responsible conduct on the part of the regulated entities We have asked banks to design suitability and performance requirements for financial products and financial services keeping in mind the interests of its customers This includes Board level oversight arrangements that a bank must put in place in order to meet these objectives As we further strengthen our approach towards addressing the concerns in the area of conduct based regulations the guiding philosophy would be to set certain minimum regulatory expectations with the option for entities to adopt higher standards depending upon their size proportionality and customer focus The ultimate message is that the regulated entities should treat all customers big or small urban or rural educated or less educated in a transparent and ethical manner Principle Based vs Rule Based Regulations There is an ongoing debate of whether a principle based approach is preferable or whether a rulebased approach to regulations is the better option At different points in time one approach has influenced the policymakers more than the other The benefit of rulesbased regulations is that it provides certainty and firm guidance on what regulated entities are required to do and from the regulators point of view the measurable and explainable regulatory targets and responsibilities that can be easily monitored and enforced But in a prescriptive approach to regulation the rules might end up becoming more important than the intended outcome for which they were designed leading to a culture of box ticking compliance In contrast principlebased regulation is more like a compass providing regulated entities with a general direction without specifying the precise route to be taken The principles are crafted to be suitable for a wide array of situations and emphasize on desired outcomes They grant regulated entities the flexibility to adapt to evolving circumstances and to innovate however it also requires them to exercise prudent judgment and make responsible decisions But often to make the regulatory expectations clear principlebased regulations are required to be supplemented with clarifications illustrations and guidance notes So where do we stand in the continuum of rulebased and principlebased regulatory approach The Reserve Bank as a matter of policy has been gradually giving banks greater operational freedom to conduct their business operations within the overarching regulatory framework We are thus moving at a good pace towards making our regulations increasingly principlebased Maintaining a Level Playing Field A level playing field ensures that all participants operate within a fair and consistent regulatory framework where the potential risks and rewards of the financial system are evenly balanced There is widespread agreement that a level playing field is a key condition for a competitive financial sector As a regulator we are following the principle of same activity same risk same regulation This approach can be seen in the case of our guidelines on Digital lending first loss default guarantee FLDG and microfinance sector However maintaining a level playing field has to be counter balanced by ensuring regulations that are proportionate to the risks posed by the firm to the financial system We are quite mindful of the need to ensure that the regulatory burden on an entity should be proportionate to the risks posed by it to the financial system and to the size of its operation This thought has underscored our revised scalebased regulatory approach to NBFCs and revised regulatory framework for UCBs It however must also be appreciated that limiting the potential for regulatory arbitrage and establishing a level playing field for market participants is an important objective for regulators but it is not the overriding one To ensure efficient market functioning and more broadly to safeguard the public interest policymakers may at times need to treat different players differently Conclusion Let me conclude Framing regulations in todays dynamic and interconnected world is a challenging task but it is a challenge that we are fully committed to overcoming As a regulator our most important contribution to the society is that we do our job by making forward looking riskbased and proportionate regulations and implement them in a consistent manner At the same time we are conscious that process of regulation making must yield a net surplus for the financial system Even as we move forward on these lines we need to remain steadfast in our dedication to

economies Improvement in manufacturing labour markets and retail sales powered strong recoveries in some countries whereas in others a rise in new infections prompted a slower pace of unlocking or reimposition of restrictions which in turn stalled the upturn Generally investment has remained in retrenchment while consumption and exports have started to improve Massive policy support across all countries has prevented a deeper downslide providing a floor underneath employment household incomes and businesses Financial conditions continue to remain benign 5 The Indian economy is entering into a decisive phase in the fight against the pandemic Relative to preCOVID levels several highfrequency indicators are pointing to the easing of contractions in various sectors of the economy and the emergence of impulses of growth Rather than enumerating them I have in the interest of time set them out in an Annex to this statement By all indications the deep contractions of Q1202021 are behind us silver linings are visible in the flattening of the active caseload curve across the country Barring the incidence of a second wave India stands poised to shrug off the deathly grip of the virus and renew its tryst with its preCOVID growth trajectory 6 In this environment the focus must now shift from containment to revival Undeterred by the pandemic the rural economy looks resilient Kharif sowing has already surpassed last years acreage as well as the normal sown area Improved soil moisture conditions along with healthy reservoir levels have brightened the outlook for the rabi season Early estimates suggest that food grains production is set to cross another record in 202021 Job creation under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act MNREGA has provided incomes and employment in rural areas Meanwhile migrant labour is returning to work in urban areas and factories and construction activity are coming back to life This is also reflected in rising levels of energy consumption and population mobility In cities traffic intensity is rising rapidly online commerce is booming and people are getting back to offices The mood of the nation has shifted from fear and despair to confidence and hope 7 Some of this optimism is being reflected in peoples expectations In the September 2020 round of the RBIs survey households expect inflation to decline modestly over the next three months indicative of hope that supply chains are mending Our projections indicate that inflation would ease closer to the target by Q4202021 Our other surveys also conducted in September indicate that consumer confidence is turning upbeat on the general economic situation employment and income over a one year ahead horizon While the current assessment of the overall business situation remains in contraction in Q2 it has moved up from a low in Q1 Forwardlooking business expectations are optimistic on the overall business situation production order books employment exports and capacity utilisation 8 The manufacturing purchasing managers index PMI for September 2020 rose to 568 its highest mark since January 2012 supported by acceleration in new orders and production The services PMI for September at 498 remained in contraction but has risen from 418 in August These expectations are also reflected in our growth projections which suggest that GDP growth may break out of contraction and turn positive by Q4 9 There is currently an animated debate about the shape of the recovery Will it be V U L or W More recently there has also been talk of a Kshaped recovery In my view it is likely to predominantly be a threespeed recovery with individual sectors showing varying paces depending on sectorspecific realities Sectors that would open their accounts the earliest are expected to be those that have shown resilience in the face of the pandemic and are also labourintensive Agriculture and allied activities fast moving consumer goods two wheelers passenger vehicles and tractors drugs and pharmaceuticals and electricity generation especially renewables are some of the sectors in this category In several of these areas reforms such as in agricultural marketing and value chains encompassing cold storage transport and processing changes in labour laws and creation of capacity for production and distribution of vaccines have already opened up new vistas for fresh investment to step in 10 The second category of sectors to strike form would comprise sectors where activity is normalising gradually The third category of sectors would include the ones which face the slog overs but they can rescue the innings These are sectors that are most severely affected by social distancing and are contactintensive 11 The modest recovery in various highfrequency indicators in September 2020 could strengthen further in the second half of 202021 with progressive unlocking of economic activity Agriculture and allied activities could well lead the revival by boosting rural demand Manufacturing firms expect capacity utilisation to recover in Q3202021 and activity to gain some traction from Q3 onwards Both private investment and exports are likely to be subdued especially as external demand is still anaemic For the year 202021 as a whole therefore real GDP is expected to decline by 95 per cent with risks tilted to the downside If however the current momentum of upturn gains ground a faster and stronger rebound is eminently feasible Financial Market Guidance 12 Over the last few weeks there has been some disconnect between the rationale underlying the RBIs debt management and monetary operations on the one hand and expectations in the market on the other I thought I should take this opportunity to address these issues squarely so that market participants and the RBI share a common set of expectations which in turn should engender orderly market conditions 13 As the monetary policy authority with the responsibilities for development and regulation of financial markets and the management of public debt the RBI has prioritised the orderly functioning of markets and financial institutions easing of financing conditions and the provision of adequate systemlevel as well as targeted liquidity This is important from the point of view of smooth and seamless transmission of monetary policy impulses as well as the completion of market borrowing programmes of the centre and states in a nondisruptive manner with a normal evolution of the yield curve Since February 2020 the RBI has taken a series of measures in this direction The RBI stands ready to undertake further measures as necessary to assure market participants of access to liquidity and easy financing conditions 14 Notwithstanding an augmented market borrowing programme for 202021 the issuances for the first half of the year have been seamlessly managed both for the centre and the states The weighted average cost of borrowings by the central government during the first half of 202021 at 582 per cent is the lowest in the last 16 years The weighted average maturity of the outstanding stock of the centre has also been the highest so far The RBI has assured that the borrowing programme of the centre and states for rest of 202021 will be completed in a nondisruptive manner without compromising on price and financial stability In pursuit of this objective the limit for Ways and Means Advances WMA for the centre has been kept higher at 125 lakh crore compared to 35000 crore in H2 of the previous year Similarly the 60 per cent increase in WMA limit for states in the first half of 202021 has been extended for a further period of 6 months till March 31 2021 15 Market participants should be assured that in keeping with the monetary policy stance announced today the RBI will maintain comfortable liquidity conditions and will conduct market operations in the form of outright and special open market operations In response to feedback from market participants the size of these auctions will be increased to 20000 crore It is expected that the market participants will respond positively to this initiative 16 Yields in the government securities gsec market both primary and secondary segments also need to evolve in alignment with the comfortable liquidity conditions This is important for those segments of the financial markets that rely on the gsec yield curve as a benchmark for pricing financial instruments so as to benefit from the easy financing conditions engendered by the RBIs policy measures and operations 17 Financial market stability and the orderly evolution of the yield curve are public goods and both market participants and the RBI have a shared responsibility in this regard The augmented borrowing programme for 202021 has been necessitated due to the exigencies imposed by the pandemic in the form of the fiscal stimulus and the loss of tax revenue While this has imposed pressures on the market in the form of expanded supply of paper the RBI stands ready to conduct market operations as required through a variety of instruments to assuage these pressures dispel any illiquidity in financial markets and maintain orderly market conditions Market participants on their part need to take a broader time perspective and display bidding behaviour that reflects a sensitivity to the signals from the RBI in the conduct of monetary policy and debt management We look forward to cooperative solutions for the borrowing programme for the second half of the year It is said that it takes at least two views to make a market but these views can be competitive without being combative 18 In this context it is appropriate that I set out our assessment of underlying inflation dynamics and the outlook Abstracting from the period AprilMay 2020 when imputations imposed a break in the CPI inflation series headline inflation has moved up from March 2020 levels and has persisted above the tolerance band of the target Our assessment is that it will remain elevated in the September print but ease gradually towards the target over Q3 and Q4 Our analysis suggests that supply disruptions and associated marginsmarkups are the major factors driving up inflation As supply chains are restored these wedges should dissipate Meanwhile aggregate demand remains subdued and there is evidence of considerable resource slack Large excess supply conditions characterise food grains and horticulture production and the outlook for agriculture is bright Crude prices remain rangebound The MPC has hence decided to look through the current inflation hump as transient and address the more urgent need to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID19 This has provided the space for continuing with the accommodative stance with forward guidance as set out in the MPCs resolution Additional Measures 19 Against this backdrop and to provide impetus towards reviving the economy certain additional measures are being announced today These measures are intended to i enhance liquidity support for financial markets ii regulatory support to improve the flow of credit to specific sectors within the ambit of the norms for credit discipline iii provide a boost to exports and iv deepen financial inclusion and facilitate ease of doing business by upgrading payment system services i Liquidity Measures a On Tap TLTRO 20 The focus of liquidity measures by the RBI will now include revival of activity in specific sectors that have both backward and forward linkages and multiplier effects on growth Accordingly it has been decided to conduct on tap TLTRO with tenors of up to three years for a total amount of up to 100000 crore at a floating rate linked to the policy repo rate The scheme will be available up to March 31 2021 with flexibility with regard to enhancement of the amount and period after a review of the response to the scheme Liquidity availed by banks under the scheme has to be deployed in corporate bonds commercial papers and nonconvertible debentures issued by entities in specific sectors over and above the outstanding level of their investments in such instruments as on September 30 2020 The liquidity availed under the scheme can also be used to extend bank loans to these sectors Moreover banks that had availed of funds earlier under targeted longterm repo operations TLTRO and TLTRO 20 will be given the option of reversing these transactions before maturity In view of the borrowing requirements of the centre and states in the second half of 202021 and the likely pickup in demand for credit as the recovery gathers strength on tap TLTROs are intended to enable banks to conduct their operations smoothly and seamlessly without being hindered by illiquidity frictions The objective is to ensure that liquidity in the system remains comfortable b SLR Holdings in Held to Maturity Category 21 On September 1 2020 the RBI increased the investments permitted to be classified as Held to Maturity HTM from 195 per cent to 22 per cent of NDTL in respect of SLR securities acquired on or after September 1 2020 up to March 31 2021 In order to provide certainty to banks as regards their investments and to foster orderly market conditions while ensuring congenial financing costs it has been decided to extend the dispensation of the enhanced HTM limit of 22 percent up to March 31 2022 for securities acquired between September 1 2020 and March 31 2021 It is expected that banks will be able to plan their investments in SLR securities in an optimal manner c Open Market Operations OMOs in State Development Loans SDLs 22 In order to impart liquidity to SDLs and thereby facilitate efficient pricing it has been decided to conduct open market operations OMOs in SDLs as a special case during the current financial year This would improve secondary market activity and rationalize spreads of SDLs over central government securities of comparable maturities This measure along with the extension of HTM till March 2022 should ease concerns about illiquidity and absorptive capacity for the total government borrowing in the current year ii Export Support Review of systembased automatic Caution Listing of Exporters 23 Exports have been adversely impacted by the pandemicrelated contraction in external demand In this environment it is crucial to provide flexibility to exporters in the realisation of export proceeds and to empower them to negotiate better terms with overseas buyers In order to facilitate the same and make the cautionlisting process exporterfriendly and equitable it has been decided to discontinue the systembased automatic cautionlisting The RBI will henceforth undertake cautionlisting on the basis of casespecific recommendations of the Authorised Dealer AD banks iii Regulatory Measures 24 At the current juncture the financial sector has a crucial role in leading the nascent economic revival It is in this context that the RBI is announcing certain measures aimed at catalysing augmented credit flows to the productive sectors of the economy a Revised Regulatory Limits for Retail Portfolio of Banks 25 Under the extant framework the maximum aggregated retail exposure to one counterparty should not exceed the absolute threshold limit of 5 crore In order to facilitate higher credit flow to this segment which mainly consists of individuals and small businesses ie with turnover of upto 50 crore and in harmonization with the Basel guidelines it has been decided to increase this threshold to 75 crore in respect of all fresh as well as incremental qualifying exposures This measure is expected to expand credit flow to small businesses b Rationalisation of Risk Weights on Individual Housing Loans 26 Under the extant regulations differential risk weights are applicable to individual housing loans based on the size of the loan as well as the loantovalue ratio LTV In recognition of the role of the real estate sector in generating employment and economic activity it has been decided to rationalise the risk weights and link them to LTV ratios only for all new housing loans sanctioned up to March 31 2022 This measure is expected to give a fillip to the real estate sector iv Financial Inclusion Review of the Coorigination Model 27 In 2018 the RBI put in place a framework for coorigination of loans by banks and a category of Non Banking Financial Companies NBFCs for lending to the priority sector subject to certain conditions Based on the feedback received from stakeholders it has been decided to extend the scheme to all NBFCs including HFCs in respect of all eligible priority sector loans and allow greater operational flexibility to the lending institutions This CoLending Model is expected to leverage the comparative advantages of banks and NBFCs in a collaborative effort and improve the flow of credit to the unserved and underserved sectors of the economy v Payment and Settlement Systems a RoundtheClock Availability of Real Time Gross Settlement RTGS System 28 In December 2019 the RBI made available the National Electronic Funds Transfer NEFT system on a 24x7x365 basis and the system has been operating smoothly since then In order to facilitate swift and seamless payments in real time for domestic businesses and institutions it has been decided to make available the RTGS system round the clock on all days from December 2020 India will be among very few countries globally with a 24x7x365 large value real time payment system This will facilitate innovations in the large value payments ecosystem and promote ease of doing business b Perpetual Validity for Certificate of Authorisation CoA issued to Payment System Operators PSOs 29 Under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007 the RBI currently gives on tap authorisation to payment system operators PSOs for limited periods of up to five years In order to obviate licensing and business uncertainty for PSOs it has been decided to grant authorisation for all PSOs new applicants as well as existing PSOs on a perpetual basis subject to certain conditions This will reduce compliance costs and create a climate conducive for investment activities increased employment and infusion of new talent and technologies into value chains Conclusion 30 COVID19 has tested and severely stretched our resources and our endurance Our travails are not over yet and a renewed rise in infections remains a serious risk We have however come far on an untravelled road with selfbelief and the courage of hope We will reach deep into our fortitude and inner strength to overcome whatever formidable challenges COVID19 may unleash going forward If we have the resolve to be steadfast till we emerge victorious I am confident we will muster the forces needed to subdue the pandemic In the words of Mahatma Gandhi and I quoteif I have the belief that I can do it I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it1 Against all odds we shall strive and revive Thank you Stay safe and stay well Namaskar 1 The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi Electronic Book New Delhi Publications Division

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_SpeechesView.aspx?Id=1099,Date It is Time for Banks to Look Deeply Within Reorienting Banking PostCovid,1 The COVID19 pandemic still continues to keep the world on the edge The pandemic has so far infected more than 23 crore people and has claimed more than 8 lakh lives worldwide The world is struggling to find a vaccine andor a cure to the deadly virus In India also the spread of pandemic continues unabated though the fatality rate is much lower 2 As the pandemic ravages on the economic impact is hard to measure While there are green shoots and some businesses are getting back to prepandemic levels the uncertainty over the length and intensity of the pandemic and its impact on the economy continue to cause concern In the wake of the pandemic RBI has stepped forward and has so far announced various liquidity monetary regulatory and supervisory measures in the form of interest rate cuts higher structural and durable liquidity moratorium on debt servicing asset classification standstill and recently a special resolution window within our Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets 3 This framework is a well thought out decision taken in consultation with stakeholders and is aimed at striking a balance between protecting the interest of depositors and maintaining financial stability on one hand and preserving the economic value of viable businesses by providing durable relief to businesses as well as individuals affected by the Covid19 pandemic on the other We expect efficient and diligent implementation of the resolution plans by the banks keeping the above objectives in mind While the moratorium on loans was a temporary solution in the context of the lockdown the resolution framework is expected to give durable relief to borrowers facing Covid related stress 4 RBIs response to the situation arising out of Covid has been unprecedented The measures taken by the RBI are intended to deal with the specific situation of Covid and can not be permanent Post containment of COVID19 I repeat post containment of Covid a very careful trajectory needs to be followed for orderly unwinding of the various countercyclical measures taken by the RBI and the financial sector should return to normal functioning without relying on the regulatory relaxations and other measures as the new norm 5 In my address today I would like to dwell upon the following theme It is Time for Banks to Look Deeply Within Reorienting Banking PostCovid Just like boosting immunity of the population is the key to tackle pandemics the key to long term financial stability would be to foster tangible improvement in the inherent ability of the banks to withstand the exogenous shocks like the current pandemic As I have stated elsewhere the causes of weak banks can usually be traced to one or more of the following conditions an inappropriate business model given the business environment quality or the lack of governance and decision making misalignment of internal incentive structures with external shareholderstakeholder interests1 and other factors Accordingly the core of resilient banks is made up of good governance effective risk management and robust internal controls This is not to say that Indian banks do not have sound governance and risk management systems in place There is always scope for improvement and these are the areas which need greater attention going forward 6 In recent years the business landscape of banks has undergone significant change Today the banks need to look out for sunrise sectors while supporting those which have the potential to bounce back For instance Banks need to look at prospective business opportunities in the rural sector which remain unexplored despite efforts to support it They need to look at startups renewables logistics value chains and other such potential areas The banking sector has a responsible role to play not only as a facilitator of growth of the economy but also to earn its own bread Thus a complete relook at the business strategy and orientation is the immediate need of the hour 7 Scale ignites the volume effect in business turnover but that presupposes bigger size of the banks Despite several reforms in the banking sector since its nationalisation lot more needs to be done With change in time the nature of reforms needs to be reconfigured The current steps towards consolidation of public sector banks in line with the Narasimham Committee recommendation is a step in the right direction Indian banks this way can reap the benefits of scale and become partners in the newer business opportunities across the globe Larger and more efficient banks both in public and private sector can compete shoulder to shoulder with the global banks to get a decent space in the global value chains 8 Size is essential but efficiency is even more important Efficiency however is a much broader concept and requires several other factors to evolve and act along its side The prerequisite will be use of technology The quality and ingenuity of technology should match our aspirations of acquiring scale and diversion of business across the globe The focus of use of technology should shift from transactionsbased to businessoriented We have a pocket full of technological tools like bigdata artificial intelligence machine learning to leverage upon in order to be able to compete with the global players in reaping the benefits of creativity looming large all over 9 While introspecting on newer ideas to improve the health of banks and quality of banking it is fundamental to reform the culture of governance and risk management systems These two areas lend inherent strength to the business of banking and good amount of work has been done in this direction over the years The RBI has issued a discussion paper on Governance in Commercial Banks for comments from various stakeholders Ideally efficiency should be ownershipneutral While it is natural that the capitalproviders or investors would like to remain alive to the aspects of how exactly a bank is run it is worthwhile to allow sufficient leeway to the Board and management of a bank to run the affairs of a bank in a professional and autonomous manner A decent distance between the owner and the professionally sound management and Board would promote robustness of banking institutions 10 There will be newer risks with newer business models More so when banks get bigger and more connected across diverse jurisdictions High growth by virtue of newer business models can be achieved with clear understanding of ones own strengths and weakness Remaining overly riskaverse may seem to be a measure of selfimmunisation but will be selfdefeating as it would affect the bottom lines adversely Risk propensity should be in alignment with the individual banks measured riskappetite The risk management system should be sophisticated enough to smell vulnerabilities brewing within the various businesses well in advance and should be dynamic enough to capture looming risks in sync with the changes in external environment and best practices 11 One visible area of concern in the arena of risk management is the inability to manage the operational risks more particularly controlling the incidence of frauds both cyberrelated and otherwise The higher incidence of frauds which have come to light in the recent times have their origins in not so efficient risk management capacity of the banks both at the time of sanctioning of loans as well as in post sanction credit monitoring It is observed that it takes many months after a fraud is committed before it comes to light Banks need to tighten their underwriting and credit monitoring standards and ensure that incidences of frauds are reduced by early detection and are followed up by initiating appropriate legal action against the fraudsters Here too the need is to leverage on technology namely artificial intelligence to study the patterns of such incidences and the root cause behind their recurrence 12 An effective early warning system and forwardlooking stress testing framework should be an integral part of the risk management framework of the banks Banks should be able to pickup incipient signals of stress faced by their borrowers and take proactive remedial action which may include a viable resolution of the credit facilities aimed at preserving the value of the assets and not just aimed at reducing the short term burden on the balance sheet of the banks 13 In addition to a strong risk culture banks should also have appropriate compliance culture Cost of compliance should be perceived as an investment as inadequacy of the same will prove to be very costly The compliance culture of banks should ensure adherence to laws rules regulations and various codes of conduct Compliance should go beyond what is legally binding and attempt to embrace broader standards of integrity and ethical conduct2 The essential features of the compliance culture are broadly similar to the essential features of risk culture All these will also help to maintain a high degree of market reputation which is imperative for retaining customers and commanding a higher valuation amongst the investors 14 A good governance framework and effective risk and compliance culture should be complemented by a robust assurance mechanism by way of internal audit function This is an integral part of sound corporate governance which should provide an independent assurance to the Board of the bank as well as to external stakeholders that the operations of the entity are performed in accordance with the set policies and procedures 15 The competition in the Indian banking system has been increasing over the years and unless banks meet the expectations of their target customers even a well thought out business model may not succeed In this context quality of customer service and redress of customer grievances assume high importance We have to recognize that banks exist for customers viz both depositors and borrowers 16 Indias banking and financial system has displayed tremendous operational resilience in the face of Covid and lockdowns Going ahead financial institutions in India have to walk a tightrope of nurturing the recovery within the overarching objective of preserving longterm stability of the financial system The current pandemic related shock is likely to place greater pressure on the balance sheets of banks leading to erosion of their capital Proactive building of buffers and raising capital will be crucial not only to ensure credit flow but also to build resilience in the financial system resilience of individual banks and financial entities as well as resilience of the financial sector as a whole We have already advised all banks large nondeposit taking NBFCs and all deposittaking NBFCs to assess the impact of COVID19 on their balance sheet asset quality liquidity profitability and capital adequacy Based on the outcome of such stress testing banks and NBFCs should work out possible mitigation measures including capital planning capital raising and contingency liquidity planning among others Upfront capital infusion would also improve the sentiment of investors and other stakeholders alike for the sector to continue remaining attractive for investors both domestic and foreign over the medium to longterm Some of the banks have already either raised or announced capital raising This process needs to be carried forward vigorously by Banks and NBFCs both in the public and private sector 17 In conclusion I would like to say that Covid19 poses several challenges for banks and the financial sector Proactive action on various fronts some of which I have highlighted will enable us to deal with these challenges effectively and maintain the soundness of Indian banking system I am reminded here of a quote from Leo Tolstoy in War and Peace a battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it 1 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision July 2015 Guidelines for identifying and dealing with weak banks 2 Bank

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=50174,Date Governors Statement August 6 2020,The Monetary Policy Committee met on 4th 5th and 6th August for its second meeting of 202021 the 24th under its aegis completing four years of its operation under the new monetary policy framework The MPC sifted through domestic and global conditions and evaluated their unfolding impact on overall outlook for India and the world At the end of its deliberations the MPC voted unanimously to leave the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent and continue with the accommodative stance of monetary policy as long as necessary to revive growth mitigate the impact of COVID19 while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward The Marginal Standing Facility MSF rate and the Bank rate remain unchanged at 425 per cent The reverse repo rate stands unchanged at 335 per cent I thank the MPC members for their valuable contributions to the policy decision taken today 2 The Reserve Bank of India RBI is perhaps the only central bank in the world to have set up a special quarantine facility with its officers staff and service providers numbering about 200 for critical operations to ensure business continuity in banking and financial market operations and payment systems Other teams in the RBI have ensured availability of digital banking channels ATMs internet mobile banking cyber security redress of customer grievances and carried out sustained campaigns about safe use of digital transactions through RBI Kehta Hai Our teams have also provided logistical support and engaged in analysis and research to back the conduct of financial and monetary policies I am proud of all of them for their tireless commitment to public service I would also like to applaud all employees of banks and other financial entities for ensuring uninterrupted operations in these trying times Our gratitude also goes out to all COVID warriors medical and health personnel police and other law enforcement agencies authorities at various levels and others Assessment 3 In the MPCs assessment global economic activity has remained fragile and in retrenchment in the first half of 2020 A renewed surge in COVID19 infections in major economies in July has subdued some early signs of revival that had appeared in May and June Global financial markets however have been buoyant with the return of riskon sentiment inserting a disconnect from the underlying state of the real economy Portfolio flows to emerging markets have resumed and their currencies have appreciated 4 The global manufacturing purchasing managers index PMI and the global services PMI rose to 503 and 505 respectively in July moving back to the expansion zone The World Trade Organisation WTO has estimated that the volume of merchandise trade shrank by 30 per cent yearonyear in Q1 and early estimates suggest a fall of 185 per cent in Q2 CPI inflation remains largely subdued across major AEs primarily due to benign fuel prices and soft aggregate demand since March In most EMEs however CPI inflation after easing in AprilMay rose in June amidst costpush pressures Domestic food inflation remains elevated across most economies since the onset of the pandemic 5 The MPC noted that in India too economic activity had started to recover from the lows of AprilMay however surges of fresh infections have forced reclamping of lockdowns in several cities and states Consequently several high frequency indicators have levelled off The agriculture sectors prospects are strengthened by the progress of the southwest monsoon and expansion in the total area sown under kharif crops by 139 per cent up to July 31 over last year Industrial production remained in contraction albeit at a moderated pace in May The manufacturing purchasing managers index PMI shrank in July for the fourth consecutive month The PMI services remained in contractionary zone in July although the downturn eased relative to the June reading 6 Headline CPI inflation which was at 58 per cent in March 2020 was placed at 61 per cent in the provisional estimates for June 2020 Inflation pressures were evident across all subgroups Households one year ahead inflation expectations were lower than their three months ahead expectations in the July 2020 round of the Reserve Banks survey indicating their anticipation of lower inflation over the longer horizon Producers sentiments on input prices remained muted as their salary outgoes fell Their selling prices contracted in Q1 in the AprilJune round of the Reserve Banks industrial outlook survey 7 Indias merchandise exports contracted for the fourth successive month in June 2020 although the pace of fall moderated Imports fell sharply in June in a broadbased manner reflecting weak domestic demand and low international crude oil prices The merchandise trade balance recorded a surplus in June US 08 billion after a gap of over 18 years 8 On the financing side net foreign direct investment moderated to US 44 billion in AprilMay 2020 from US 72 billion a year ago In 202021 AprilJuly net foreign portfolio investment FPI in equities at US 53 billion was higher than US 12 billion a year ago In the debt segment however there were outflows of US 44 billion during the same period as against inflows of US 20 billion a year ago Net investment under the voluntary retention route increased by US 09 billion during the same period Indias foreign exchange reserves have increased by US 568 billion in 202021 so far AprilJuly to US 5346 billion as on July 31 2020 equivalent to 134 months of imports The ratio of foreign exchange reserves to external debt has gone up from 760 per cent at the March 2019 to 855 per cent at the end of March 2020 Outlook 9 Against this backdrop the MPC was of the view that supply chain disruptions on account of COVID19 persist with implications for both food and nonfood prices A more favourable food inflation outlook may emerge as the bumper rabi harvest eases prices of cereals especially if open market sales and public distribution offtake are expanded on the back of significantly higher procurement Nonetheless upside risks to food prices remain The abatement of price pressure in key vegetables is delayed and remains contingent upon normalisation of supplies Proteinbased food items could also emerge as a pressure point Higher domestic taxes on petroleum products have resulted in elevated domestic pump prices and will impart broadbased cost push pressures going forward Taking into consideration all these factors the MPC expects headline inflation to remain elevated in Q2202021 but likely to ease in H2202021 aided by favourable base effects 10 As regards the outlook for growth the MPC noted that the recovery of the rural economy is expected to be robust buoyed by the progress in kharif sowing Manufacturing firms expect domestic demand to recover gradually from Q2 and to sustain through Q1202122 On the other hand consumer confidence turned more pessimistic in July relative to the preceding round of the Reserve Banks survey External demand is expected to remain anaemic under the weight of the global recession and contraction in global trade Taking into consideration the above factors real GDP growth in the first half of the year is estimated to remain in the contraction zone For the year 202021 as a whole real GDP growth is also estimated to be negative An early containment of the COVID19 pandemic may impart an upside to the outlook A more protracted spread of the pandemic deviations from the forecast of a normal monsoon and global financial market volatility are the key downside risks 11 The MPC noted that in an environment of unprecedented stress supporting recovery of the economy assumes primacy in the conduct of monetary policy While space for further monetary policy action is available it is important to use it judiciously to maximise the beneficial effects for underlying economic activity At the same time the MPC is conscious of its medium term inflation target The headline inflation prints of AprilMay 2020 are obscured by a the spike in food prices and b costpush pressures Meanwhile the cumulative reduction of 250 basis points is working its way through the economy lowering interest rates in money bond and credit markets and narrowing down spreads Given the uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook and extremely weak state of the economy in the midst of an unprecedented shock from the ongoing pandemic the MPC decided to keep the policy rate on hold while remaining watchful for a durable reduction in inflation to use available space to support the revival of the economy 12 Living with the pandemic has improved the way we manage it working from home virtual meetings and contactless transactions Throughout this traumatic period one thing has stood out the indomitable spirit of humanity the inner conviction that whatever be the challenge we have the innate resilience to combat them overcome them and emerge victorious I continue to be an eternal optimist Mahatma Gandhi should inspire us If our resolve is firm and our conviction clear it would mean half the battle won1 Impact of the Monetary and Liquidity Measures taken by the RBI 13 Against this backdrop let me turn to the impact of the monetary and liquidity measures so far taken by the RBI to mitigate the negative fallout of COVID19 14 It may be noted that transmission of the rate cuts by the MPC would not have been possible to the extent achieved so far without creating comfortable liquidity conditions The overriding objective was to prevent financial markets from freezing up ensure normal functioning of financial intermediaries ease the stress faced by households and businesses and keep the life blood of finance flowing This is achieved by infusing large amounts of liquidity in and out of the system through injections and absorptions through the LAF In the process the easing of financial conditions has actually enhanced monetary transmission and thereby the effectiveness of the MPCs accommodative stance and actions What is more the injections of liquidity including through open market operations special operations and forex interventions are being fully sterilised by absorptions through the reverse repo while preventing a seizure of money markets under extreme risk aversion and uncertainty 15 Another aspect that needs to be recognised is that RBIs open market purchases are aimed at reducing funding costs for private sector entities that issue instruments in the market which are usually priced off the Gsec yield as the benchmark In fact it is worthwhile to see who is benefiting from RBIs actions Borrowing costs in financial markets have dropped to their lowest in a decade on the back of abundant liquidity Interest rates on instruments like the 3month Treasury bill commercial paper CP and certificates of deposit have fully priced in the reduction in the policy rate and are in fact trading below it in the secondary market CPs of NBFCs have softened to 380 per cent on July 31 2020 Rates have fallen to 340 per cent on July 31 2020 for nonNBFC borrowers 16 With illiquidity premia dissipating under the impact of Operation Twist and TLTRO 10 spreads of 3year AAArated corporate bonds over similar tenor government securities have also declined from 276 basis points on March 26 2020 to 50 basis points on July 31 2020 Spreads on AA rated bonds softened from 307 basis points to 104 basis points spreads on AA bonds narrowed from 344 basis points to 142 basis points over the same period Even for the lowest investment grade bonds BBB spreads have come down by 125 basis points as on July 31 2020 17 Lower borrowing costs have led to record primary issuance of corporate bonds of 209 lakh crore in the first quarter of AprilJune 202021 In particular market financing conditions for NBFCs which had become challenging have largely stabilised in the wake of targeted policy measures For AA rated 3year NBFC bonds spreads over similar tenor Gsecs have narrowed from 360 basis points on March 26 to 139 basis points on July 31 2020 18 Abundant liquidity has supported other segments of financial markets too In particular MFs have stabilised since the Franklin Templeton episode Assets under management of Debt MFs which fell to 1220 lakh crore as on April 29 2020 recovered and improved to 1389 lakh crore as on July 31 2020 19 At the same time financial conditions have improved in specific sectors Although nonfood bank credit has slowed to 56 per cent As on July 17 credit to NBFCs is growing at 257 per cent in June loans to services at 107 per cent and to housing at 125 per cent Monetary transmission has also improved considerably The weighted average lending rate WALR on fresh rupee loans sanctioned by banks declined by 162 basis points during February 2019June 2020 of which 91 basis points transmission was witnessed during MarchJune 2020 Additional Measures 20 With COVID19 infections rising unabated under fragile macroeconomic and financial conditions we propose to undertake additional developmental and regulatory policy measures to i enhance liquidity support for financial markets and other stakeholders ii further ease financial stress caused by COVID19 disruptions while strengthening credit discipline iii improve the flow of credit iv deepen digital payment systems v augment customer safety in cheque payments and vi facilitate innovations across the financial sector by leveraging on technology 21 In the worst peacetime health and economic crisis of the last 100 years that we face today the regulatory response has to be dynamic proactive and balanced While designing the major announcements that I am making today we have ensured that necessary safeguards are in place for preserving financial stability We are fully mindful of RBIs responsibility to maintain stability of the financial sector While I am outlining the main measures the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Measures addresses them in greater detail i Additional Special Liquidity Facility ASLF 22 Additional special liquidity facility of 10000 crore will be provided at the policy repo rate consisting of 5000 crore to the National Housing Bank NHB to shield the housing sector from liquidity disruptions and augment the flow of finance to the sector through housing finance companies HFCs and 5000 crore to the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development NABARD to ameliorate the stress being faced by smaller nonbank finance companies NBFCs and microfinance institutions in obtaining access to liquidity ii Resolution Framework for COVID19related Stress 23 The Prudential Framework on Resolution of Stressed Assets dated June 7 2019 provides a principlebased resolution framework for addressing borrower defaults Any resolution plan implemented under the Prudential Framework which involves granting of any concessions on account of financial difficulty of the borrower entails an asset classification downgrade except when accompanied by a change in ownership subject to prescribed conditions 24 The disruptions caused by COVID19 have led to heightened financial stress for borrowers across the board A large number of firms that otherwise maintain a good track record under existing promoters face the challenge of their debt burden becoming disproportionate relative to their cash flow generation abilities This can potentially impact their longterm viability and pose significant financial stability risks if it becomes widespread Accordingly it has been decided to provide a window under the June 7th Prudential Framework to enable lenders to implement a resolution plan in respect of eligible corporate exposures without change in ownership as well as personal loans while classifying such exposures as standard assets subject to specified conditions 25 In the light of past experience with regard to use of regulatory forbearance necessary safeguards have been incorporated including prudent entry norms clearly defined boundary conditions specific binding covenants independent validation and strict postimplementation performance monitoring The underlying theme of this resolution window is preservation of the soundness of the Indian banking sector 26 The Reserve Bank is constituting an Expert Committee Chairman Shri KV Kamath which shall make recommendations to the RBI on the required financial parameters along with the sector specific benchmark ranges for such parameters to be factored into resolution plans The Expert Committee shall also undertake a process validation of resolution plans for borrowal accounts above a specified threshold The details of the resolution framework are spelt out in Part B of the MPC resolution and the circular both of which will be issued immediately after this press statement iii Restructuring of MSME debt 27 A restructuring framework for MSMEs that were in default but standard as on January 1 2020 is already in place The scheme has provided relief to a large number of MSMEs With COVID19 continuing to disrupt normal functioning and cash flows the stress in the MSME sector has got accentuated warranting further support Accordingly it has been decided that stressed MSME borrowers will be made eligible for restructuring their debt under the existing framework provided their accounts with the concerned lender were classified as standard as on March 1 2020 This restructuring will have to be implemented by March 31 2021 iv Advances against Gold Ornaments and Jewellery 28 As per extant guidelines loans sanctioned by banks against pledge of gold ornaments and jewellery for nonagricultural purposes should not exceed 75 per cent of the value of gold ornaments and jewellery With a view to mitigating the impact of COVID19 on households it has been decided to increase the permissible loan to value ratio LTV for such loans to 90 per cent This relaxation shall be available till March 31 2021 v Banks Investment in Debt Mutual Funds and Debt Exchange Traded funds Capital Charge for Market risk 29 As per RBIs extant Basel III guidelines if a bank holds a debt instrument directly it would have to allocate lower capital as compared to holding the same debt instrument through a Mutual Fund MFExchange Traded Fund ETF It has been decided to harmonise the differential treatment existing currently This will result in substantial capital savings for banks and is expected to give a boost to the corporate bond market vi Review of Priority Sector Lending Guidelines 30 With a view to aligning the guidelines with emerging national priorities and bring sharper focus on inclusive development the Priority Sector Lending PSL guidelines have been reviewed An incentive framework is now being put in place for banks to address the regional disparities in the flow of priority sector credit While higher weightage will be assigned for incremental priority sector credit in the identified districts having lower credit flow a lower weightage would be assigned in identified districts where the credit flow is comparatively higher PSL status is also being given to startups and the limits for renewable energy including solar power and compressed biogas plants are being increased vii Other measures that are being announced today include 31 a Introduction of an automated mechanism in eKuber system to provide banks more flexibilitydiscretion in managing their liquidity and maintenance of cash reserve requirements b While permitting lenders to provide relief to the borrowers through various measures it is also considered necessary to take appropriate measures for strengthening credit discipline In view of the concerns emanating from use of multiple operating accounts by borrowers both current accounts as well as cash credit CCoverdraft OD accounts it has been decided to put in place certain safeguards for opening of such accounts for borrowers availing credit facilities from multiple banks c The Reserve Bank has constantly endeavoured to encourage responsible innovation by entities in the financial services sector In order to further promote and facilitate an environment that can accelerate innovation across the financial sector Reserve Bank will set up an Innovation Hub in India Further details about the Innovation Hub would be announced in due course d To enhance safety of cheque payments it has been decided to introduce a mechanism of Positive Pay for all cheques of value 50000 and above This will cover approximately 20 per cent and 80 per cent of total cheques by volume and value respectively Operational guidelines in this regard will be issued separately e A scheme of retail payments in offline mode using cards and mobile devices and a system of on online dispute resolution ODR mechanism for digital payments will also be introduced Concluding Remarks 32 At this juncture the war against COVID19 is most intense and the world is bracing up for a second wave as it cautiously opens up The pandemic poses a challenge of epic proportions but our collective efforts intrepid choices innovations and true grit will eventually take us to victory As Mahatma Gandhi had said Patience and perseverance if we have them overcome mountains of difficulties2 The challenges of today will only strengthen our resilience and selfbelief We shall remain alert and watchful and collectively do whatever is necessary to revive the economy and preserve financial stability Courage and conviction will conquer Covid19 Thank you Press Release 20202021148 1 Mahatma Gandhi Harijan July 21 1940 2 Mind of Mahatma Gandhi Eds Prabhu

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/bs_viewcontent.aspx?Id=3859,abc,It is when the horizon is the darkest and human reason is beaten down to the ground that faith shines brightest and comes to our rescue1 As a nation we must have faith in Indias resilience and capacity to overcome all odds COVID19 a virus of the size of 012 microns has crippled the global economy with more than 300000 dead and economic activity across the world stalled Once again central banks have to answer the call to the frontline in defence of the economy 2 The recent release of macroeconomic data that for the first time revealed the damage wrought by COVID19 brought forward the need for an offcycle meeting of the monetary policy committee MPC in lieu of the scheduled meeting during June 3 to 5 2020 Over the last three days ie 20th 21st and 22nd May 2020 the MPC reviewed domestic and global developments and their implications for the outlook After extensive discussions the MPC voted unanimously for a reduction in the policy repo rate and for maintaining the accommodative stance of monetary policy as long as necessary to revive growth mitigate the impact of COVID19 while ensuring that inflation remains within the target On the quantum of reduction the MPC voted with a 51 majority to reduce the policy rate by 40 basis points from 44 per cent to 40 per cent Consequently the Marginal Standing Facility MSF rate and the Bank rate stand reduced to 425 from 465 The reverse repo rate stands reduced to 335 from 375 3 Before I lay out the backdrop the rationale and expected outcomes of the MPCs decision I wish to thank the Committee members for their valuable contributions to the work of the Committee in the monetary policy decision taken today I would also like to thank my colleagues in the RBI who have been working tirelessly in our fight against COVID19 My gratitude goes out to our teams for their intellectual support analytical work and logistical arrangements A special word of praise for our team of over 200 officers staff and service providers who are working unstinted 24X7 in isolation in order to keep essential RBI services available to the nation I wish to express our admiration for doctors healthcare and medical staff police and law enforcement agencies functionaries and personnel in the government the private sector banks and other financial institutions who have risen to the call of duty day after day through the pandemic to ensure continuity in the provision of all essential services Our deepest gratitude to their families too I Assessment 4 By all counts the macroeconomic and financial conditions are austere The global economy is inexorably headed into recession The global manufacturing purchasing managers index PMI contracted to an 11year low in April 2020 The global services PMI recorded its steepest decline in the history of the index Among advanced economies AEs that have released GDP readings for Q1 2020 contractions were in the range of 34 per cent to 142 per cent qoq annualised for emerging market economies EMEs the growth rate ranged between 29 per cent and 68 per cent year on year basis EMEs face additional pressures in the form of capital outflows and asset price volatility from the bouts of turbulence afflicting financial markets The plunge in crude prices has dried up budgetary revenues for oil exporters on the other hand oil importers have been denied terms of trade gains by the crushing blow to demand delivered by the pandemic According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD the value of global trade contracted by 30 per cent in Q12020 The volume of world trade can shrink by 1332 per cent in 2020 as projected by the World Trade Organisation WTO World services trade deteriorated in the first quarter of 2020 due to a broadbased loss of momentum in passenger air travel container shipping financial and ICT services While commodity prices have eased on large demand shocks amidst widespread lockdowns food price pressures are visible in inflation prints due to supply disruptions especially in countries where food is a prominent item of households consumption expenditure Global financial markets have calmed after a turbulent period in March and volatility has ebbed but markets have generally been disconnected from real economy developments 5 Relatively unsung the global policy response by central banks and governments has been unprecedented 6 Let me now turn to domestic developments Domestic economic activity has been impacted severely by the 2 months lockdown The top 6 industrialised states that account for about 60 per cent of industrial output are largely in red or orange zones High frequency indicators point to a collapse in demand beginning in March 2020 across both urban and rural segments Electricity and petroleum products consumption indicators of day to day demand have plunged into steep declines The double whammy in terms of losses of both demand and production has in turn taken its toll on fiscal revenues Investment demand has been virtually halted by a decline of 36 per cent in the production of capital goods in March which was coincident with a contraction of 27 per cent in imports of capital goods in March and 575 per cent in April This is also evident in a fall of 91 per cent in finished steel consumption in April and a 25 per cent shrinkage in cement production in March The biggest blow from COVID19 has been to private consumption which accounts for about 60 per cent of domestic demand The production of consumer durables fell by 33 per cent in March 2020 accompanied by a 16 per cent decline in the output of nondurables Similar indications are reflected in surveys of the fast moving consumer goods space 7 In the production sectors industrial production shrank by close to 17 per cent in March 2020 with manufacturing activity down by 21 per cent The output of core industries which constitutes about 40 per cent of overall industrial production contracted by 65 per cent The manufacturing PMI for April recorded its sharpest deterioration to 274 spread across all sectors The services PMI plunged to an all alltime low of 54 in April 2020 8 Amidst this encircling gloom agriculture and allied activities have provided a beacon of hope on the back of an increase of 37 per cent in foodgrains production to a new record as per the third advance estimates of the Ministry of Agriculture released on May 15 2020 A ray of hope also comes from the forecast of a normal southwest monsoon in 2020 by the India Meteorological Department IMD By May 10 2020 up to which latest information is available kharif sowing was higher by 44 per cent over last years acreage Rabi procurement is in full flow in respect of oilseeds pulses and wheat benefiting from the bumper harvest These developments will support farm incomes improve the terms of trade facing the farm sector and strengthen food security for the country Going forward these would also have a salutary effect on food price pressures 9 The inflation outlook has become complicated by the release of partial information on the consumer price index CPI by the National Statistical OfficeNSO obscuring a comprehensive assessment of the price situation From the incomplete data that have been made available food inflation which had eased from its January 2020 peak for the second successive month in March suddenly reversed and surged to 86 per cent in April as supply disruptions took their toll immune to the ongoing demand compression Prices of vegetables pulses edible oils milk and cereals emerged as pressure points2 10 In the external sector Indias merchandise exports and imports suffered their worst slump in the last 30 years as COVID19 paralysed world production and demand Indias merchandise exports plunged by 603 per cent in April 2020 while imports contracted by 586 per cent The trade deficit narrowed to US 68 billion in April 2020 lowest since June 2016 On the financing side net foreign direct investment inflows picked up in March 2020 to US 29 billion from US 08 billion a year ago In 202021 so far till May 18 net foreign portfolio investment FPI in equities has also increased to US 12 billion from US 08 billion a year ago In the debt segment however there were portfolio outflows of US 38 billion during the same period as against outflows of US 14 billion a year ago By contrast net investment under the voluntary retention route increased by US 07 billion during the same period Indias foreign exchange reserves have increased by US 92 billion in 202021 so far up to May 15 to US 4870 billion equivalent to a years imports II Outlook 11 Against this backdrop the MPC assessed that the inflation outlook is highly uncertain The supply shock to food prices in April may show persistence over the next few months depending upon the state of lockdown and the time taken to restore supply chains after relaxation Among the pressure points the elevated level of pulses inflation is worrisome and warrants timely and swift supply management interventions including a reappraisal of import duties Immediate stepup of open market salesPDSofftake by the FCI to offload some part of excess stocks can cool down cereal prices and also create room for rabi procurement Given the current global demandsupply balance international crude oil prices metals and industrial raw material prices are likely to remain soft This would ease input costs for domestic firms Deficient demand may hold down pressures on core inflation although persisting supply dislocations impart uncertainty to the near term outlook Much will depend on the shape of the recovery after COVID Accordingly the MPC is of the view that headline inflation may remain firm in the first half of 202021 but should ease in the second half aided also by favourable base effects By Q3 and Q4 of FY2021 it is expected to fall below target Thus the MPCs forward guidance on inflation is directional rather than in terms of levels Going forward as and when more data are available it should be possible to estimate the path of inflation with greater certainty 12 It is in the growth outlook that the MPC judged the risks to be gravest The combined impact of demand compression and supply disruption will depress economic activity in the first half of the year Assuming that economic activity gets restored in a phased manner especially in the second half of this year and taking into consideration favourable base effects it is expected that the combination of fiscal monetary and administrative measures being currently undertaken would create conditions for a gradual revival in activity in the second half of 202021 Nonetheless downside risks to this assessment are significant and contingent upon the containment of the pandemic and quick phasing out of social distancinglockdowns Given all these uncertainties GDP growth in 202021 is estimated to remain in negative territory with some pickup in growth impulses from H2 202021 onwards The endMay 2020 release of NSO on national income should provide greater clarity enabling more specific projections of GDP growth in terms of both magnitude and direction Much will depend on how quickly the COVID curve flattens and begins to moderate As the nation prepares for this future the words of Mahatma Gandhi should inspire us to fight on We may stumble and fall but shall rise again3 13 The MPC is of the view that that the macroeconomic impact of the pandemic is turning out to be more severe than initially anticipated Beyond the destruction of economic and financial activity livelihood and health are severely affected Judging that the risks to growth are acute while the risks to inflation are likely to be shortlived the MPC believes that it is essential now to instil confidence and ease financial conditions further This will facilitate the flow of funds at affordable rates and rekindle investment impulses It is in this context that the MPC voted to reduce the policy repo rate by 40 basis points from 44 per cent to 40 per cent If the inflation trajectory evolves as expected more space will open up to address the risks to growth III Regulatory and Developmental Measures 14 I now turn to the various regulatory and developmental measures being announced today to complement and amplify the reduction in the policy rate decided by the MPC While doing so let me spend a little time on the policy actions already taken by the RBI their rationale and their likely impact In my statement at the time of the MPCs meeting in February 2020 I had pointed out the increasing downside risks to global growth in the context of the outbreak of the coronavirus the full effects of which were still uncertain and unfolding Since then the RBI has proactively managed liquidity conditions expanding its array of measures both conventional and unconventional to augment systemlevel liquidity both in rupees and forex as also to channel liquidity to specific sectors facing funding constraints These liquidity measures are intended to keep the financial system and financial markets functioning as normally as possible under the circumstances so that financial conditions do not freeze up 15 In the meantime monetary policy transmission to banks lending rates has continued to improve The 1 year median marginal cost of fundsbased lending rate MCLR declined by 90 bps February 2019May 15 2020 The weighted average lending rate WALR on fresh rupee loans has cumulatively declined by 114 bps since February 2019 of which 43 bps decline occurred in March 2020 alone The WALR on outstanding rupee loans declined by 29 bps during October 2019March 2020 Domestic financial conditions have also eased as reflected in the narrowing of liquidity premia in various market segments After April 17th when I last spoke to you interest rates on 3month CPs 3month CDs 5year AAA corporate bonds 91day Treasury Bills 5year and benchmark 10year government paper have softened by 220 bps 108 bps 48 bps 71 bps 59 bps and 66 bps respectively by May 15 2020 16 The decision of the MPC to reduce the policy repo rate and maintain the accommodative stance of monetary policy provides the opportunity for the RBI to announce certain additional measures against the backdrop of a deteriorating outlook for economic activity These policy actions complement and strengthen each other in intent and reach The measures being announced today can be broadly delineated under four categories A measures to improve the functioning of markets and market participants B measures to support exports and imports C efforts to further ease financial stress caused by COVID19 disruptions by providing relief on debt servicing and improving access to working capital and D steps to ease financial constraints faced by state governments A Measures to Improve the Functioning of Markets Refinancing Facility for Small Industries Development Bank of India SIDBI 17 The RBI had earlier announced a special refinance facility of 15000 crore to SIDBI at RBIs policy repo rate for a period of 90 days for onlendingrefinancing In order to provide greater flexibility to SIDBI it has been decided to roll over the facility at the end of the 90th day for another period of 90 days Investments by Foreign Portfolio Investors FPIs under the Voluntary Retention Route VRR 18 Since its introduction the VRR scheme has evinced strong investor participation with investments exceeding 90 per cent of the limits allotted under the scheme In view of difficulties expressed by FPIs and their custodians on account of COVID19 related disruptions in adhering to the condition that at least 75 per cent of allotted limits be invested within three months it has been decided that an additional three months time will be allowed to FPIs to fulfil this requirement B Measures to Support Exports and Imports 19 The deepening of the contraction in global activity and trade accentuated by the rapid spread of COVID19 has crippled external demand In turn this has impacted Indias exports and imports both of which have contracted sharply in recent months In view of the importance of exports and imports to the economy certain measures are being taken to support the foreign trade sector Export Credit 20 In order to alleviate genuine difficulties being faced by exporters in their production and realisation cycles it has been decided to increase the maximum permissible period of preshipment and postshipment export credit sanctioned by banks from the existing one year to 15 months for disbursements made up to July 31 2020 Liquidity Facility for Exim Bank of India 21 In order to enable EXIM bank to meet its foreign currency resource requirements it has been decided to extend a line of credit of 15000 crore to the EXIM Bank for a period of 90 days with rollover up to one year so as to enable it to avail a US dollar swap facility Extension of Time for Payment for Imports 22 With a view to providing greater flexibility to importers in managing their operating cycles in a COVID19 environment it has been decided to extend the time period for completion of outward remittances against normal imports ie excluding import of golddiamonds and precious stonesjewellery into India from six months to twelve months from the date of shipment for such imports made on or before July 31 2020 C Measures to Ease Financial Stress 23 The RBI had earlier on two separate occasions March 27 and April 17 2020 announced certain regulatory measures pertaining to a granting of 3 months moratorium on term loan installments b deferment of interest for 3 months on working capital facilities c easing of working capital financing requirements by reducing margins or reassessment of working capital cycle d exemption from being classified as defaulter in supervisory reporting and reporting to credit information companies e extension of resolution timelines for stressed assets and f asset classification standstill by excluding the moratorium period of 3 months etc by lending institutions 24 In view of the extension of the lockdown and continuing disruptions on account of COVID19 the above measures are being extended by another three months from June 1 2020 till August 31 2020 taking the total period of applicability of the measures to six months ie from March 1 2020 to August 31 2020 The lending institutions are being permitted to restore the margins for working capital to their original levels by March 31 2021 Similarly the measures pertaining to reassessment of working capital cycle are being extended up to March 31 2021 25 Additionally it has been decided to permit lending institutions to convert the accumulated interest on working capital facilities over the total deferment period of 6 months ie March 1 2020 up to August 31 2020 into a funded interest term loan which shall be fully repaid during the course of the current financial year ending March 31 2021 26 In view of the current difficulty in raising resources from capital markets the group exposure limit of banks is being increased from 25 per cent to 30 per cent of eligible capital base for enabling corporates to meet their funding requirements from banks The increased limit will be applicable up to June 30 2021 D Measures to ease financial constraints faced by State Governments Consolidated Sinking Fund CSF of State Governments Relaxation of Guidelines 27 In order to ease the bond redemption pressure on states it has been decided to relax the rules governing withdrawal from the CSF while at the same time ensuring that depletion of the Fund balance is done prudently Together with the normally permissible withdrawal this measure will enable the states to meet about 45 per cent of the redemptions of their market borrowings due in 202021 This change in withdrawal norms will come into force with immediate effect and will remain valid till March 31 2021 28 Detailed guidelines for all the above announcements will be issued separately Concluding Remarks 29 Central banks are typically seen as conservative institutions Yet when the tides turn and all the chips are down it is to them that the world turns for support As I have stated earlier the RBI will continue to remain vigilant and in battle readiness to use all its instruments and even fashion new ones as the recent experience has demonstrated to address the dynamics of the unknown future The goals as I have enunciated earlier are i to keep the financial system and financial markets sound liquid and smoothly functioning ii to ensure access to finance to all especially those that tend to get excluded by financial markets and iii to preserve financial stability It shall be our endeavour that RBIs actions and stance contribute to laying the foundations of a better tomorrow Todays trials may be traumatic but together we shall triumph Thank

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/bs_viewcontent.aspx?Id=3853,abc,Today humanity faces perhaps the trial of its time as COVID19 grips the world in its deadly embrace Everywhere as also in India the mission is to do whatever it takes to prevent epidemiological curve from steepening any further Human spirit is ignited by the resolve to overcome the pandemic It is during our darkest moments that we must focus on the light As Mahatma Gandhi said in his famous address at Kingsley Hall London in October 1931 In the midst of death life persists in the midst of untruth truth persists in the midst of darkness light persists 2 Before I begin I wish to place on record our gratitude to all functionaries and personnel in the government the private sector banks and other financial institutions who risk their lives on a daily basis by going to work or by working from home to fight the pandemic by keeping essential services operational Our deepest appreciation goes out to doctors healthcare and medical staff police and law enforcement agencies who are at the frontline In the RBI I would like to specially commend and thank our team of 150 officers staff and service providers who are in quarantine away from families and are at work 24X7 to keep essential services such as currency in circulation retail and wholesale payment and settlement systems reserve management financial markets and liquidity management financial regulation and supervision and a host of other services available so that the nation may survive COVID19 Banks and financial institutions have risen to the occasion and have ensured normal functioning Their efforts are praiseworthy I would also like to thank my colleagues in the RBI who set aside personal health concerns and join me in fashioning the array of measures taken by the RBI in the context of COVID19 I also thank our teams for their intellectual support analytical work and logistical arrangements I Assessment of the Current Economic Situation 3 Since March 27 2020 when I spoke to you last the macroeconomic and financial landscape has deteriorated precipitously in some areas but light still shines through bravely in some others On April 14 the IMF released its global growth projections revealing that in 2020 the global economy is expected to plunge into the worst recession since the Great Depression far worse than the Global Financial Crisis The IMFs Economic Counsellor has named it the Great Lockdown estimating the cumulative loss to global GDP over 2020 and 2021 at around 9 trillion US dollars greater than the economies of Japan and Germany combined Within this downturn the projections are replete with even sharper declines in output in various countries India is among the handful of countries that is projected to cling on tenuously to positive growth at 19 per cent In fact this is the highest growth rate among the G 20 economies The World Trade Organisation sees global merchandise trade contracting by as much as 1332 per cent in 2020 Global financial markets remain volatile and emerging market economies are grappling with capital outflows and volatile exchange rates Crude oil prices remain in a state of flux despite the agreement on production cuts by OPEC plus countries For 2021 the IMF projects sizable Vshaped recoveries close to 9 percentage points for global GDP India is expected to post a sharp turnaround and resume its preCOVID preslowdown trajectory by growing at 74 per cent in 202122 4 Over the last three weeks there have been a few data releases on domestic developments but they are too disjointed to allow a comprehensive assessment of the state of the economy Yet there are a few slivers of brightness amidst the encircling gloom In my statement of March 27 I had referred to the continuing resilience of agriculture and allied activities on the back of alltime highs in the production of food grains and horticulture with huge buffer stocks of rice and wheat far in excess of the buffer norms By April 10 premonsoon kharif sowing had begun strongly with acreage of paddy the principal kharif crop up by 37 per cent in comparison with the last season1 States such as West Bengal Telangana Odisha Assam Karnataka and Chhattisgarh are leading in sowing activity despite the lockdown On April 15 the India Meteorological Department IMD forecast a normal south west monsoon for the 2020 season with rainfall expected to be 100 per cent of the long period average These early developments bode well for rural demand supported as they are by accelerating fertiliser production up to February 2020 The robust growth of 213 per cent in tractor sales up to February 2020 as against a contraction of 05 per cent in AprilFebruary last year may provide an offset to farm labour shortages on account of the lockdown 5 In other production sectors the situation is more sombre On April 9 the index of industrial production for February was released showing that industrial output accelerated to its highest rate in seven months The impact of COVID19 is not yet captured in these prints More tellingly however the revival in electricity generation a coincident indicator of demand that had commenced from January 2020 has been halted by a sharp fall in daily demand in the range of 2530 per cent after the lockdown announcement on March 25 2020 Automobile production and sales and port freight traffic declined sharply in March as recently released data indicate The manufacturing purchasing mangers index PMI for March 2020 which was released on April 2 was the lowest in the last four months Notably suppliers delivery time lengthened for the first time in five months indicating supply disruptions The April 6 release showed that the services PMI declined into contraction in March 2020 pulled down by a sharp downturn in export business new domestic orders and employment 6 In the external sector the contraction in exports in March 2020 at 346 per cent has turned out to be much more severe than during the global financial crisis Barring iron ore all exporting sectors showed a decline in outbound shipments Merchandise imports also fell by 287 per cent in March across the board barring transport equipment Consequently the trade deficit declined to US 98 billion in March 2020 from US 110 billion a year ago Net foreign direct investment inflows amounted to US 406 billion during 201920 AprilFebruary up from US 299 billion a year ago In February net FDI was of the order of US 29 billion as compared with US 19 billion a year ago Net foreign portfolio investment in equities recorded inflow of US 04 billion during 202021 till April 9 as against the inflow of US 02 billion a year ago Portfolio debt investment recorded an outflow of US 07 billion as against net outflow of US 09 billion a year ago In addition net investment by FPIs under voluntary retention route VRR was US 01 billion during the same period The level of foreign exchange reserves continue to be robust at US 4765 billion on April 10 2020 equivalent to 118 months of imports 7 Turning to the status of banking operations since the nationwide lockdown was imposed by the Government of India from March 25 2020 the RBI has taken a number of steps to ensure normal business functioning by the entire banking sector As a result the payment infrastructure is running seamlessly Banks have been required to put in place business continuity plans to operate from their disaster recovery DR sites andor to identify alternate locations for critical operations so that there is no disruption in customer services Our data show that there was no downtime of internet or mobile banking On an average ATM operations stood at over 91 per cent of full capacity The average availability of Business Correspondents BCs is over 80 per cent Regional offices of the RBI have supplied fresh currency of 12 lakh crore from March1 till April 14 2020 to currency chests across the country to meet increased demand for currency in the wake of the COVID19 pandemic Banks have risen to the occasion by refilling ATMs regularly despite logistical challenges 8 In my statement of March 27 I had indicated that together with the measures announced on March 27 the RBIs liquidity injection was about 32 per cent of GDP since the February 2020 MPC meeting Since then surplus liquidity in the banking system has increased sharply in the wake of sustained government spending Systemic liquidity surplus as reflected in net absorptions under the LAF averaged 436 lakh crore during the period March 27 April 14 2020 As announced on March 27 the RBI undertook three auctions of targeted long term repo operations TLTRO injecting cumulatively 75041 crore to ease liquidity constraints in the banking system and destress financial markets Another TLTRO auction of 25000 crore will be conducted today April 17 In response to these auctions financial conditions have eased considerably as reflected in the spreads on money and bond market instruments Moreover activity in the corporate bond market has picked up appreciably with several corporates making new issuances There are also indications that redemption pressures faced by mutual funds have moderated II Additional Measures 9 Against this backdrop and based on our continuing assessment of the macroeconomic situation and financial market conditions we propose to take further measures to i maintain adequate liquidity in the system and its constituents in the face of COVID19 related dislocations ii facilitate and incentivise bank credit flows iii ease financial stress and iv enable the normal functioning of markets IIA Liquidity Management 10 The RBI has moved in a calibrated fashion to ensure conducive financial conditions and normalcy in the functioning of financial markets and institutions The initial efforts to provide adequate system level liquidity are reflected in the sizable net absorptions under reverse repo operations With this achieved the RBI has undertaken measures to target liquidity provision to sectors and entities which are experiencing liquidity constraints andor hindrances to market access Long term repo operations LTROs to ensure adequate liquidity at the longer end of the yield curve exemptions from the cash reserve ratio for the equivalent of incremental credit disbursed by banks as loans in certain select areassegments and targeted LTROs or TLTROs fall in this class of sectorspecific measures It is however observed that the deployment of TLTRO funds so far has largely been to bonds issued by public sector entities and large corporates especially in primary issuances The disruptions caused by COVID19 have however more severely impacted small and midsized corporates including nonbanking financial companies NBFCs and micro finance institutions MFIs in terms of access to liquidity Targeted Long Term Operations TLTRO 20 11 Accordingly it has been decided to conduct targeted longterm repo operations TLTRO 20 for an aggregate amount of 50000 crore to begin with in tranches of appropriate sizes The funds availed by banks under TLTRO 20 should be invested in investment grade bonds commercial paper and nonconvertible debentures of NBFCs with at least 50 per cent of the total amount availed going to small and midsized NBFCs and MFIs The guidelines will spell out the details These investments have to be made within one month of the availment of liquidity from the RBI As in the case of TLTRO auctions conducted hitherto investments made by banks under this facility will be classified as held to maturity HTM even in excess of 25 per cent of total investment permitted to be included in the HTM portfolio Exposures under this facility will also not be reckoned under the large exposure framework Notification for the first TLTRO 20 auction will be issued today Refinancing Facilities for All India Financial Institutions AIFIs 12 All India financial institutions AIFIs such as the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development NABARD the Small Industries Development Bank of India SIDBI and the National Housing Bank NHB play an important role in meeting the longterm funding requirements of agriculture and the rural sector small industries housing finance companies NBFCs and MFIs These All India Financial Institutions raise resources from the market through specified instruments allowed by the Reserve Bank in addition to relying on their internal sources In view of the tightening of financial conditions in the wake of the COVID19 pandemic these institutions are facing difficulties in raising resources from the market Accordingly it has been decided to provide special refinance facilities for a total amount of 50000 crore to NABARD SIDBI and NHB to enable them to meet sectoral credit needs This will comprise 25000 crore to NABARD for refinancing regional rural banks RRBs cooperative banks and micro finance institutions MFIs 15000 crore to SIDBI for onlendingrefinancing and 10000 crore to NHB for supporting housing finance companies HFCs Advances under this facility will be charged at the RBIs policy repo rate at the time of availment Liquidity Adjustment Facility Fixed Rate Reverse Repo Rate 13 As I have mentioned earlier the surplus liquidity in the banking system has risen significantly in the wake of government spending and the various liquidity enhancing measures undertaken by the RBI On April 15 the amount absorbed under reverse repo operations was 69 lakh crore In order to encourage banks to deploy these surplus funds in investments and loans in productive sectors of the economy it has been decided to reduce the fixed rate reverse repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility LAF by 25 basis points from 40 per cent to 375 per cent with immediate effect The policy repo rate remains unchanged at 440 per cent and the marginal standing facility rate and the Bank Rate remain unchanged at 465 per cent Ways and Means Advances for States 14 On April 1 2020 the RBI had announced an increase in the ways and means advances WMA limit of states by 30 per cent It has now been decided to increase the WMA limit of states by 60 per cent over and above the level as on March 31 2020 to provide greater comfort to the states for undertaking COVID19 containment and mitigation efforts and to plan their market borrowing programmes better The increased limit will be available till September 30 2020 IIB Regulatory Measures 15 On March 27 2020 the Reserve Bank had announced certain regulatory measures to mitigate the burden of debt servicing brought about by disruptions on account of COVID19 and to ensure the continuity of viable businesses Based on a review of the rapidly evolving situation and consistent with the globally coordinated action committed to by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to alleviate the impact of Covid19 on the global banking system additional regulatory measures are being announced today Asset Classification 16 Economic activity has come to a standstill during the period of the lockdown with consequential lingering effects which have unambiguously affected the cash flows of households and businesses On March 27 2020 the RBI had permitted lending institutions LIs to grant a moratorium of three months on payment of current dues falling between March 1 and May 31 2020 It is recognized that the onset of COVID19 has also exacerbated the challenges for such borrowers even to honour their commitments fallen due on or before February 29 2020 in Standard Accounts The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision BCBS has taken cognizance of the financial and economic impact of COVID19 and very recently announced that the payment moratorium periods Public or granted by banks on a voluntary basis relating to the COVID19 outbreak can be excluded by banks from the number of days past due in respect of NPA recognition 17 Therefore it has been decided that in respect of all accounts for which lending institutions decide to grant moratorium or deferment and which were standard as on March 1 2020 the 90day NPA norm shall exclude the moratorium period ie there would an asset classification standstill for all such accounts from March 1 2020 to May 31 2020 NBFCs which are required to comply with Indian Accounting Standards IndAS may be guided by the guidelines duly approved by their boards and as per advisories of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ICAI in recognition of impairments In other words NBFCs have flexibility under the prescribed accounting standards to consider such relief to their borrowers 18 At the same time we are cognizant of the risk buildup in banks balance sheets on account of firmlevel stress and delays in recoveries With the objective of ensuring that banks maintain sufficient buffers and remain adequately provisioned to meet future challenges they will have to maintain higher provision of 10 per cent on all such accounts under the standstill spread over two quarters ie March 2020 and June 2020 These provisions can be adjusted later on against the provisioning requirements for actual slippages in such accounts Extension of Resolution Timeline 19 Under RBIs prudential framework of resolution of stressed assets dated June 7 2019 in the case of large accounts under default Scheduled Commercial Banks AIFIs NBFCNDSIs and NBFCD are currently required to hold an additional provision of 20 per cent if a resolution plan has not been implemented within 210 days from the date of such default Recognizing the challenges to resolution of stressed assets in the current volatile environment it has been decided that the period for resolution plan shall be extended by 90 days Details will be spelt out in the circular Distribution of Dividend 20 It is imperative that banks conserve capital to retain their capacity to support the economy and absorb losses in an environment of heightened uncertainty It has therefore been decided that in view of the COVID19related economic shock scheduled commercial banks and cooperative banks shall not make any further dividend payouts from profits pertaining to the financial year ended March 31 2020 until further instructions This restriction shall be reviewed on the basis of the financial position of banks for the quarter ending September 30 2020 Liquidity Coverage Ratio 21 The Reserve Bank has been proactively taking measures to address the systemic liquidity issues through a slew of monetary and market operations In order to ease the liquidity position at the level of individual institutions the LCR requirement for Scheduled Commercial Banks is being brought down from 100 per cent to 80 per cent with immediate effect The requirement shall be gradually restored back in two phases 90 per cent by October 1 2020 and 100 per cent by April 1 2021 NBFC Loans to Commercial Real Estate Projects 22 In terms of the extant guidelines for banks the date for commencement for commercial operations DCCO in respect of loans to commercial real estate projects delayed for reasons beyond the control of promoters can be extended by an additional one year over and above the oneyear extension permitted in normal course without treating the same as restructuring It has now been decided to extend a similar treatment to loans given by NBFCs to commercial real estate This will provide relief to NBFCs as well as the real estate sector III Concluding Remarks 23 In conclusion I would like to review recent developments relating to inflation and the outlook without infringing in any way on the mandate of the monetary policy committee MPC The press release of the National Statistics Office NSO on April 13 2020 showed that CPI inflation for March 20202 declined by 70 basis points to 59 per cent This is however based on data gathered up to 19th March 2020 The data showed a softening of food inflation by around 160 basis points on account of the easing of prices of vegetables eggs meat fish pulses oils and fats fruits and sugar In other categories of the CPI inflation pressures remained firm Daily data on 22 essential food items covered by the Department of Consumer Affairs DCA suggest that food prices have increased by 23 per cent in April so far up to April 13 2020 in a broadbased manner though onion prices have continued to decline while PDS kerosene prices have slumped by 24 per cent in the first fortnight of April Domestic LPG prices also declined by 8 per cent These early developments suggest that inflation is on a declining trajectory having fallen by 170 basis points from its January 2020 peak 24 In the period ahead inflation could recede even further barring supply disruption shocks and may even settle well below the target of 4 per cent by the second half of 202021 Such an outlook would make policy space available to address the intensification of risks to growth and financial stability brought on by COVID19 This space needs to be used effectively and in time 25 The RBI will monitor the evolving situation continuously and use all its instruments to address the daunting challenges posed by the pandemic The overarching objective is to keep the financial system and financial markets sound liquid and smoothly functioning so that finance keeps flowing to all stakeholders especially those that are disadvantaged and vulnerable Regulatory measures that have been announced so far including those made today are dovetailed into the objective of preserving financial stability Although social distancing separates us we stand united and resolute Eventually we shall cure and we shall endure Thank you 1 Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare 2 Owing to nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of COVID19 the field work for price collection of Consumer Price Index CPI was suspended with effect from 19th March 2020 As a result only 66 per cent of price quotations were available for compiling the CPI for the month of March 2020
https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/bs_viewcontent.aspx?Id=3847,abc,In view of the COVID19 pandemic the Monetary Policy Committee MPC decided to advance its meeting scheduled for 31st March 1st and 3rd April 2020 It met on 24th 26th and 27th March and undertook a careful evaluation of the current and evolving macroeconomic and financial conditions and the outlook I wish to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to the MPC members for their swift response to the unprecedented situation and for their valuable contribution to the monetary policy decision taken today I also wish to thank our teams in the RBI for their continued highquality support to the MPCs work through their hard work research and logistics 2 After extensive discussions the MPC voted unanimously for a sizeable reduction in the policy repo rate and for maintaining the accommodative stance of monetary policy as long as necessary to revive growth mitigate the impact of COVID19 while ensuring that inflation remains within the target While there were some differences in the quantum of reduction the MPC voted with a 42 majority to reduce the policy rate by 75 basis points to 44 per cent 3 Simultaneously the fixed rate reverse repo rate which sets the floor of the liquidity adjustment facility LAF corridor was reduced by 90 basis points to 40 per cent thus creating an asymmetrical corridor The purpose of this measure relating to reverse repo rate is to make it relatively unattractive for banks to passively deposit funds with the Reserve Bank and instead to use these funds for onlending to productive sectors of the economy It may be recalled that during the month of March so far banks have been parking close to 3 lakh crore on a daily average basis under the reverse repo even as the growth of bank credit has been steadily slowing down 4 This decision and its advancement has been warranted by the destructive force of the corona virus It is intended to a mitigate the negative effects of the virus b revive growth and above all c preserve financial stability 5 We are living through an extraordinary and unprecedented situation Everything hinges on the depth of the COVID19 outbreak its spread and its duration Clearly a war effort has to be mounted and is being mounted to combat the virus involving both conventional and unconventional measures in continuous battleready mode Life in the time of COVID19 has been one of unprecedented loss and isolation Yet it is worthwhile to remember that tough times never last only tough people and tough institutions do 6 In the recent period the Reserve Bank has been in action on a daily basis with efforts to alleviate financial stress build confidence and keep the financial system sound and functioning Measures taken by the Reserve Bank are given below a cumulative reduction in the policy repo rate of 135 basis points accommodative stance of monetary policy as long as necessary to revive growth while keeping inflation within the target two USD buysell swap auction of USD 5 billion each conducted on March 26 and April 23 2019 injecting liquidity into the banking system amounting to 34561 crore and 34874 crore respectively seven open market purchases injecting 92500 crore into the system four simultaneous purchase and sale of government securities under Open Market Operations special OMOs or what is known as operation twist during December and January December 23 and 30 2019 and January 6 and 23 2020 to ensure better monetary policy transmission five long term repo operations LTROs between February 17 and March 18 2020 for oneyear and threeyear tenors amounting to 125000 crore of durable liquidity at reasonable cost fixed repo rate exemption on incremental credit disbursed by banks between January 31 July 31 2020 on retail loans for automobiles residential housing and loans to micro small and medium enterprises MSMEs from the maintenance of cash reserve ratio CRR two 6month US Dollar sellbuy swap auction providing dollar liquidity amounting to USD 271 billion finetuning variable rate repo auctions of 50000 crore and 25000 crore of 8 days and 3 days maturity on March 26 and March 31 respectively with standalone primary dealers SPDs allowed to participate finetuning variable rate Repo auctions of 16day maturity amounting to 77745 crore on March 2324 2020 7 Let me assure all that the Reserve Bank is at work and in mission mode monitoring the evolving financial market and macroeconomic conditions and calibrating its operations to meet any need for additional liquidity support as well as other measures as may be warranted It is our effort to ensure normal functioning of markets nurture the impulses of growth and preserve financial stability Incidentally we have quarantined 150 members of our staff and service providers together with the IT facilitators as a part of our Business Continuity Plan BCP The plan was prepared and executed in a matter of days 8 The MPC noted that global economic activity has come to a near standstill as COVID19 related lockdowns and social distancing are imposed across a widening swathe of affected countries Expectations of a shallow recovery in 2020 from 2019s decade low in global growth have been dashed The outlook is now heavily contingent upon the intensity spread and duration of the pandemic There is a rising probability that large parts of the global economy will slip into recession 9 Turning to growth in India the implied real GDP growth of 47 per cent for Q4201920 in the second advance estimates of the National Statistics Office released in February 2020 within the annual estimate of 5 per cent for the year as a whole is now at risk from the pandemics impact on the economy As regards the outlook for 202021 apart from the continuing resilience of agriculture and allied activities most other sectors of the economy will be adversely impacted by the pandemic depending upon I repeat its intensity spread and duration If COVID19 is prolonged and supply chain disruptions get accentuated the global slowdown could deepen with adverse implications for India The slump in international crude prices could however provide some relief in the form of terms of trade gains Downside risks to growth arise from the spread of COVID19 and prolonged lockdowns Upside growth impulses are expected to emanate from monetary fiscal and other policy measures and the early containment of COVID19 10 As regards inflation the prints for January and February 2020 indicate that actual outcomes for the quarter are running 30 bps above projections reflecting the onion price shock Looking ahead food prices may soften even further under the beneficial effects of the record foodgrains and horticulture production at least till the onset of the usual summer uptick Furthermore the collapse in crude prices should work towards easing both fuel and core inflation pressures depending on the level of the passthrough to retail prices As a consequence of COVID19 aggregate demand may weaken and ease core inflation further Heightened volatility in financial markets could also have a bearing on inflation Given this heightened volatility unprecedented uncertainty and extremely fluid state of affairs projections of growth and inflation would be heavily contingent on the intensity spread and duration of COVID19 Precisely for these reasons the MPC refrained from giving out specific growth and inflation numbers 11 The MPC noted that macroeconomic risks both on the demand and supply sides brought on by the pandemic could be severe The need of the hour is to do whatever is necessary to shield the domestic economy from the pandemic Central banks across the world have responded with monetary and regulatory measures both conventional and unconventional Governments across the world have unleashed massive fiscal measures including targeted health services support to protect economic activity from the impact of the virus The Government of India has yesterday announced a number of measures The MPC further noted that the Reserve Bank has taken several measures to inject substantial liquidity in the system Nonetheless the priority is to undertake strong and purposeful action in order to minimise the adverse macroeconomic impact of the pandemic It also underscored the need for all stakeholders to fight against the pandemic Banks and other financial institutions should do all they can to keep credit flowing to economic agents facing financial stress on account of the isolation that the virus has imposed Market participants should work with regulators like the Reserve Bank and the SEBI to ensure the orderly functioning of markets in their role of price discovery and financial intermediation Strong fiscal measures are of course critical to deal with the situation 12 To summarise COVID19 stalks the global economy and the outlook is highly uncertain and negative Several nations are battling its exponential contagion countries are shutting down to prevent being sucked into that black hole Authorities all over the world are mobilising on a massive scale to fight an invisible assassin India has locked down Economic activity and financial markets are under severe stress Finance is the lifeline of the economy Keeping it flowing is the paramount objective The time has come for the Reserve Bank to unleash an array of instruments from its arsenal to staunch and mitigate the impact of COVID19 revive growth and above all preserve financial stability The aggressive action and stance of the MPC provides a befitting launching pad In turn the configuration of initiatives unveiled in the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies which I am now going to announce amplify the MPCs decision and leverages on it as well Accordingly it is appropriate that the MPCs decision and the Reserve Banks actions be regarded as a comprehensive package with force multipliers 13 The developmental and regulatory policies can be broadly delineated under four categories 1 measures to expand liquidity in the system sizeably to ensure that financial markets and institutions are able to function normally in the face of COVID19 related dislocations 2 steps to reinforce monetary transmission so that bank credit flows on easier terms are sustained to all those who have been affected by the pandemic 3 efforts to ease financial stress caused by COVID19 disruptions by relaxing repayment pressures and improving access to working capital and 4 endeavor to improve the functioning of markets in view of the high volatility experienced with the onset and spread of the pandemic I Liquidity Measures 14 A multipronged approach comprising both targeted and systemwide liquidity provision has been adopted to ensure that COVID19 related liquidity constraints are eased Targeted Long Term Repo Operations TLTRO 15 Large selloffs in the domestic equity bond and forex markets have intensified redemption pressures Liquidity premia on instruments such as corporate bonds commercial paper and debentures have surged Financial conditions for these instruments which are used inter alia to access working capital in the face of the slowdown in bank credit have also tightened To mitigate the adverse effects on economic activity leading to pressures on cash flows across sectors the Reserve Bank will conduct auctions of targeted term repos of up to three years tenor of appropriate sizes for a total amount of up to 100000 crore at a floating rate linked to the policy repo rate Liquidity availed under the scheme by banks has to be deployed in investment grade corporate bonds commercial paper and nonconvertible debentures over and above the outstanding level of their investments in these bonds as on March 25 2020 Eligible instruments comprise both primary market issuances and secondary market purchases including from mutual funds and nonbanking finance companies Investments made by banks under this facility will be classified as held to maturity HTM even in excess of 25 per cent of total investment permitted to be included in the HTM portfolio Exposures under this facility will also not be reckoned under the large exposure framework The first auction of 25000 crore will be conducted today The relevant notification is being issued separately Cash Reserve Ratio 16 It is observed that despite ample liquidity in the system its distribution is highly asymmetrical across the financial system and starkly so within the banking system To help banks tide over the disruption caused by COVID19 it has been decided to reduce the cash reserve ratio CRR of all banks by 100 basis points to 30 per cent of net demand and time liabilities NDTL with effect from the reporting fortnight beginning March 28 2020 for a period of one year This reduction in the CRR would release primary liquidity of about 137000 crore uniformly across the banking system in proportion to liabilities of constituents rather than in relation to holdings of excess SLR 17 Furthermore taking cognisance of hardships faced by banks in terms of social distancing of staff and consequent strains on reporting requirements it has been decided to reduce the requirement of minimum daily CRR balance maintenance from 90 per cent to 80 per cent effective from the first day of the reporting fortnight beginning March 28 2020 This is a onetime dispensation available up to June 26 2020 Marginal Standing Facility 18 In view of the exceptionally high volatility in domestic financial markets which brings in phases of liquidity stress and to provide comfort to the banking system it has been decided to increase the accommodation under the marginal standing facility MSF from 2 per cent of the statutory liquidity ratio SLR to 3 per cent with immediate effect This measure will be applicable up to June 30 2020 This measure should provide comfort to the banking system by allowing it to avail an additional 137000 crore of liquidity under the LAF window in times of stress at the reduced MSF rate announced in the MPCs resolution 19 These three measures relating to TLTRO CRR and MSF will inject a total liquidity of 374 lakh crore to the system Widening of the Monetary Policy Rate Corridor 20 In view of persistent excess liquidity it has been decided to widen the existing policy rate corridor from 50 bps to 65 bps Under the new corridor the reverse repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility LAF would be 40 bps lower than the policy repo rate as against existing 25 bps The marginal standing facility MSF rate would continue to be 25 bps above the policy repo rate II Regulation and Supervision 21 Alongside liquidity measures it is important that steps are taken to mitigate the burden of debt servicing brought about by disruptions on account of COVID19 pandemic Such steps in turn will go a long way to prevent the transmission of financial stress to the real economy and ensure the continuity of viable businesses and provide relief to borrowers in these extraordinarily troubled times These measures include moratorium on term loans deferring interest payments on working capital easing of working capital financing deferment of implementation of the net stable funding ratio and the last tranche of the capital conservation buffer Moratorium on Term Loans 22 All commercial banks including regional rural banks small finance banks and local area banks cooperative banks allIndia Financial Institutions and NBFCs including housing finance companies and microfinance institutions lending institutions are being permitted to allow a moratorium of three months on payment of instalments in respect of all term loans outstanding as on March 1 2020 Deferment of Interest on Working Capital Facilities 23 In respect of working capital facilities sanctioned in the form of cash creditoverdraft lending institutions are being permitted to allow a deferment of three months on payment of interest in respect of all such facilities outstanding as on March 1 2020 The accumulated interest for the period will be paid after the expiry of the deferment period The moratorium on term loans and the deferring of interest payments on working capital will not result in asset classification downgrade Easing of Working Capital Financing 24 In respect of working capital facilities sanctioned in the form of cash creditoverdraft lending institutions are allowed to recalculate drawing power by reducing margins andor by reassessing the working capital cycle for the borrowers Such changes will not result in asset classification downgrade 25 The moratorium on term loans the deferring of interest payments on working capital and the easing of working capital financing will not qualify as a default for the purposes of supervisory reporting and reporting to credit information companies CICs by the lending institutions Hence there will be no adverse impact on the credit history of the beneficiaries Deferment of Implementation of Net Stable Funding Ratio NSFR 26 The Net Stable Funding Ratio NSFR which reduces funding risk by requiring banks to fund their activities with sufficiently stable sources of funding over a time horizon of a year in order to mitigate the risk of future funding stress was required to be introduced by banks in India from April 1 2020 It has now been decided to defer the implementation of NSFR by six months to October 1 2020 Deferment of Last Tranche of Capital Conservation Buffer 27 The capital conservation buffer CCB is designed to ensure that banks build up capital buffers during normal times ie outside periods of stress which can be drawn down as losses are incurred during a stressed period Considering the potential stress on account of COVID19 it has been decided to further defer the implementation of the last tranche of 0625 per cent of the CCB from March 31 2020 to September 30 2020 III Financial Markets 28 The measure for financial markets assumes importance in the context of the increased volatility of the rupee caused by the impact of Covid19 on currency markets Permitting Banks to Deal in Offshore Nondeliverable Rupee derivative Markets Offshore Rupee NDF Markets 29 The offshore Indian Rupee INR derivative market the NonDeliverable Forward NDF market has been growing rapidly in recent times At present Indian banks are not permitted to participate in this market although the benefits of their participation in the NDF market have been widely recognised The time is apposite to improve efficiency of price discovery Accordingly banks in India which operate International Financial Services Centre IFSC Banking Units IBUs are being allowed to participate in the NDF market with effect from June 1 2020 30 Since the last MPC meeting of February 2020 the Reserve Bank has injected liquidity of 28 lakh crore through various instruments equivalent to 14 per cent of our GDP Together with the measures announced today RBIs liquidity injection works out to about 32 per cent of GDP 31 The RBI will continue to remain vigilant and take whatever steps are necessary to mitigate the economic impact of COVID19 and preserve financial stability As I had stated earlier all instruments conventional and unconventional are on the table 32 Before I conclude let me reiterate that the Indian banking system is safe and sound In the recent past COVID19 related volatility in the stock market has impacted share prices of banks as well resulting in some panic withdrawal of deposits from a few private sector banks It would be fallacious to link share prices to safety of deposits As I have mentioned in my earlier interaction with the media depositors of commercial banks including private sector banks need not worry on the safety of their funds I would therefore urge members of public as well as the public authorities who have deposits in private sector banks not to resort to any panic withdrawal of their funds 33 In conclusion let me say that in spite of the very challenging environment I remain optimistic It is worthwhile bearing in mind that the macroeconomic fundamentals of the Indian economy are sound and in fact stronger than what they were in the aftermath of the global financial crisis the fiscal deficit and the current account deficit are now much lower inflation conditions are relatively benign and financial volatility measured by change in stock prices from recent peaks and average daily change in the exchange rate of the rupee is distinctly lower COVID19 is upon us but this too shall pass We need to remain careful and take all precautionary measures I leave you with this comforting thought Stay clean Stay safe Go digital

thresholds ceilings or floors as the case may be for each of the above key ratios that should be considered by the lending institutions in the resolution assumptions with respect to an eligible borrower are given in the Annex In respect of those sectors where the sectorspecific thresholds have not been specified lending institutions shall make their own internal assessments regarding TOLATNW and Total DebtEBITDA However the current ratio and DSCR in all cases shall be 10 and above and ADSCR shall be 12 and above 5 Lending institutions are free to consider other financial parameters as well while finalizing the resolution assumptions in respect of eligible borrowers apart from the above mandatory key ratios and the sectorspecific thresholds that have been prescribed The above requirements are applicable even in cases when there is only one lending institution with exposure to an eligible borrower 6 The ratios prescribed in paragraph 4 are intended as floors or ceilings as the case may be but the resolution plans shall take into account the preCovid19 operating and financial performance of the borrower and impact of Covid19 on its operating and financial performance at the time of finalising the resolution plan to assess the cashflows in subsequent years while stipulating appropriate ratios in each case 7 Given the differential impact of the pandemic on various sectorsentities the lending institutions may at their discretion adopt a graded approach depending on the severity of the impact on the borrowers while preparing or implementing the resolution plan Such graded approach may also entail classification of the impact on the borrowers into mild moderate and severe as recommended by the Committee 8 Lending institutions are expected to ensure compliance to TOLATNW agreed as per the resolution plan at the time of implementation itself Nevertheless in all cases this ratio shall have to be maintained as per the resolution plan by March 31 2022 and on an ongoing basis thereafter However wherever the resolution plan envisages equity infusion the same may be suitably phasedin over this period All other key ratios shall have to be maintained as per the resolution plan by March 31 2022 and on an ongoing basis thereafter 9 The compliance in regard to meeting the agreed ratios must be monitored as financial covenants on an ongoing basis and during subsequent credit reviews Any such breach not rectified within a reasonable period in terms of the loan contract will be considered as financial difficulty Other Clarifications Applicability of ICA and Escrow account 10 The various requirements of the Resolution Framework especially the mandatory requirement of ICA wherever applicable and maintenance of an escrow account after implementation of a resolution plan shall be applicable at the borroweraccount level ie the legal entities to which the lending institutions have exposure to which could include a special purpose vehicle having a legalentity status set up for a project 11 It is further clarified that signing of ICA is a mandatory requirement for all lending institutions in all cases involving multiple lending institutions where the resolution process is invoked and the requirement of additional provisions if the ICA is not signed within 30 days of invocation does not substitute for the mandatory nature of ICA Compliance with this regulatory requirement shall be assessed for all lending institutions as part of the supervisory review Yours faithfully Prakash Baliarsingh Chief General Manager

Small Finance Banks Local Area Banks and Regional Rural Banks All Primary Urban Cooperative BanksState Cooperative Banks District Central Cooperative Banks All AllIndia Financial Institutions All NonBanking Financial Companies including Housing Finance Companies Madam Dear Sir Resolution Framework for COVID19related Stress The Reserve Bank of India Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets Directions 2019 dated June 7 2019 Prudential Framework provides a principlebased resolution framework for addressing borrower defaults under a normal scenario Any resolution plan implemented under guidelines of Prudential Framework1 which involves granting of any concession on account of financial difficulty of the borrower entails an asset classification downgrade except when it is accompanied by a change in ownership which allows the asset classification to be retained as or upgraded to Standard subject to the prescribed conditions 2 The economic fallout on account of the Covid19 pandemic has led to significant financial stress for borrowers across the board The resultant stress can potentially impact the longterm viability of many firms otherwise having a good track record under the existing promoters due to their debt burden becoming disproportionate relative to their cash flow generation abilities Such wide spread impact could impair the entire recovery process posing significant financial stability risks 3 Considering the above with the intent to facilitate revival of real sector activities and mitigate the impact on the ultimate borrowers it has been decided to provide a window under the Prudential Framework to enable the lenders to implement a resolution plan in respect of eligible corporate exposures without change in ownership and personal loans while classifying such exposures as Standard subject to specified conditions The details of the facility are given in the Annex 4 The lending institutions shall ensure that the resolution under this facility is extended only to borrowers having stress on account of Covid19 Further the lending institutions will be required to assess the viability of the resolution plan subject to the prudential boundaries laid out in this Annex Towards this end each lending institution shall put in place a Board approved policy detailing the manner in which such evaluation may be done and the objective criteria that may be applied while considering the resolution plan in each case 5 Accounts which do not fulfill the required eligibility conditions to be considered for resolution under this framework may continue to be considered for resolution under the Prudential Framework or the relevant instructions as applicable to specific category of lending institutions where the Prudential Framework is not applicable 6 While the Prudential Framework is otherwise not applicable to certain categories of lending institutions to which this circular is addressed exposures of these lending institutions shall also be included for any resolution under this facility Consequently without prejudice to the specific conditions applicable to this facility all the norms applicable to implementation of a resolution plan including the mandatory requirement of InterCreditor Agreements ICA and specific implementation conditions as laid out in the Prudential Framework shall be applicable to all lending institutions for any resolution plan implemented under this facility Terms used in this document to the extent not defined herein shall have the same meaning assigned to them in the Prudential Framework Yours faithfully Saurav Sinha Chief General ManagerinCharge Annex Conditions for the Resolution Framework for COVID19related Stress 1 The framework shall be applicable to eligible borrowers corporate persons or otherwise subject to the conditions specified herein Part A of this Annex pertains to requirements specific to resolution of personal loans and Part B pertains to resolution of other eligible borrowers Part C prescribes the prudential treatment of the exposures in respect of which resolution plans are implemented under this facility while Part D lists the

covering circular is addressed 2 Without prejudice to the exceptions specified in paragraphs 2528 of the Prudential Framework the following categories of borrowers credit facilities shall not be eligible for a resolution plan under this framework MSME borrowers whose aggregate exposure to lending institutions collectively is 25 crore or less as on March 1 2020 Farm credit as listed in

resolution under this facility is provided only to the borrowers having stress on account of Covid19 The Board approved policy shall inter alia detail the eligibility of borrowers in respect of whom the lending institutions may be willing to consider the resolution and shall lay down the due diligence considerations to be followed by the lending institutions to establish the necessity of implementing a resolution plan in respect of the concerned borrower 4 The reference date for the outstanding amount of debt that may be considered for resolution shall be March 1 2020 A Resolution of Stress in Personal Loans 5 This part shall be applicable to resolution of personal loans3 sanctioned to individual borrowers by lending institutions However credit facilities provided by lending

classified as standard but not in default for more than 30 days with the lending institution as on March 1 2020 7 The eligible borrowers accounts should continue to be classified as Standard till the date of invocation of resolution under this framework For this purpose the date of invocation shall be the date on which both the borrower and lending institution have agreed to proceed with a resolution plan under this framework 8 Resolution under this framework may be invoked not later than December 31 2020 and must be implemented within 90 days from the date of invocation However the lending institutions should strive for early invocation 9 The resolution plans may inter alia include rescheduling of payments conversion of any interest accrued or to be accrued into another credit facility or granting of moratorium based on an assessment of income streams of the borrower subject to a maximum of two years Correspondingly the overall tenor of the loan may also get modified

regarding the request for resolution by the borrower may be taken by the lending institution as per the Board approved policy of the institution and within the contours of this framework For this purpose the date of invocation shall be the date on which both the borrower and lending institution have agreed to proceed with a resolution plan under this framework 15 If there are multiple lending institutions with exposure to the borrower the resolution process shall be treated as invoked in respect of any borrower if lending institutions representing 75 per cent by value of the total outstanding credit facilities fund based as well nonfund based and not less than 60 per cent of lending institutions by number agree to invoke the same 16 Resolution under this framework may be invoked not later than December 31 2020 and must be implemented within 180 days from the date of invocation 17 In all cases involving multiple lending institutions where the resolution process is invoked and consequently a resolution plan has to be implemented ICA shall be required to be signed by all lending institutions within 30 days from the date of invocation In case of housing finance companies this shall be applicable irrespective of whether the account has been rescheduled in terms of para 21zcii of the Master Circular The Housing Finance Companies NHB Directions 2010 18 In cases where the resolution process has been invoked but lending institutions representing not less than 75 per cent by value of the total outstanding credit facilities fund based as well nonfund based and not less than 60 per cent of lending institutions by number do not sign the ICA within 30 days from the invocation the invocation will be treated as lapsed In respect of such borrowers the resolution process cannot be invoked again under this framework 19 Lenders to the borrower which are other than the lending institutions as per this circular may also sign the ICA if they so desire If such lenders sign the ICA they shall be fully bound by the stipulations of the ICA 20 All disputes if any between signatories to the ICA regarding the resolution process shall be settled as per the provisions of the ICA and the Reserve Bank will not intermediate any such disputes Lending institutions shall ensure that the ICA contains such a dispute redressal mechanism that clearly lays down the recourse available to a signatory to the ICA who wants to raise a dispute 21 As the resolution process requirements and the prudential treatment subsequent to the implementation are applied collectively to all lenders including those to which the Prudential Framework is not applicable the ICA should provide for suitable mechanisms for information sharing amongst lending institutions during and after implementation of the resolution plan 22 If any of the above timelines are breached at any point the resolution process ceases to apply immediately in respect of the borrower concerned Any resolution plan implemented in breach of the above stipulated timelines shall be fully governed by the Prudential Framework or the relevant instructions as applicable to specific

detailing the duties and responsibilities of the escrow manager and the lending institutions as well as the enforcement mechanism that will be contractually available to the escrow manager to ensure that lending institutions service their disbursement obligations on a timely basis C Asset classification and provisioning 36 Additional finance to borrowers in respect of whom the resolution plan has been invoked if sanctioned even before implementation of the plan in order to meet the interim liquidity requirements of the borrower may be classified as standard asset till implementation of the plan regardless of the actual performance of the borrower with respect to such facilities in the interim 37 However if the resolution plan is not implemented within the stipulated timelines the asset classification of the additional finance sanctioned will be as per the actual performance of the borrower with respect to the additional finance or the rest of the credit facilities whichever is worse 38 If a resolution plan is implemented in adherence to the provisions of this facility the asset classification of borrowers accounts classified as Standard may be retained as such upon implementation whereas the borrowers accounts which may have slipped into NPA between invocation and implementation may be upgraded as Standard as on the date of implementation of the plan 39 In respect of personal loans where a resolution plan is implemented under this facility the lending institutions shall keep provisions from the date of implementation which are higher of the provisions held as per the

per cent of the debt on their books as on this date carrying debt or the provisions required as per extant IRAC norms whichever is higher Even in cases where the invocation lapses on account of the thresholds for ICA signing not being met in terms of clause 18 such lending institutions which had earlier agreed for invocation but did not sign the ICA shall also be required to hold 20 percent provisions on their carrying debt 42 The additional provisions maintained if any by lending institutions in terms of the circular DORNoBPBC632104048201920 dated April 17 2020 in respect of such borrowers to the extent not already reversed may be utilised for meeting the provision requirements in all cases under this facility 43 Any additional provisions maintained in terms of Paragraph 17 of the Prudential Framework wherever applicable may be reversed at the time of invocation of the resolution plan under this facility However if the plan is not implemented within 180 days from invocation provisions as per the Prudential Framework shall be required to be maintained as if a resolution process was never invoked under this window Reversal of Provisions 44 In case of personal loans

plan and the remaining half may be written back upon the borrower paying another 10 per cent of the residual debt without slipping into NPA subsequently 45 In case of resolution of other exposures the provisions maintained by the ICA signatories may be reversed as prescribed in clause 44 However in respect of the nonICA signatories while half of the provisions may be reversed upon repayment of 20 percent of the carrying debt the other half may be reversed upon repayment of another 10 per cent of the carrying debt subject to the required IRAC provisions being maintained Post Implementation

Circular Prudential norms on Income Recognition Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to Advances dated July 1 2015 or other relevant instructions as applicable to specific category of lending institutions 47 In respect of exposures other than personal loans any default by the borrower with any of the signatories to the ICA during the monitoring period shall trigger a Review Period of 30 days Monitoring period for this purpose is defined as the period starting from the date of implementation of the resolution plan till the borrower pays 10 percent of the residual debt subject to a minimum of one year from the commencement of the first payment of interest or principal whichever is later on the credit facility with longest period of moratorium 48 If the borrower is in default with any of the signatories to the ICA at the end of the Review Period the asset classification of the borrower with all lending institutions including those who did not sign the ICA shall be downgraded to NPA from the date of implementation of the resolution plan or the date from which the borrower had been classified as NPA before implementation of the plan whichever is earlier 49 In all cases further upgradation shall be subject to implementation of a fresh restructuring under the Prudential Framework or the relevant instructions as applicable to specific category of lending institutions where the Prudential Framework is not applicable 50 Upon completion of the monitoring period without being classified as NPA the asset classification norms will revert to the criteria

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=50479,Date Monetary Policy Statement 202021 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee MPC October 79 2020,On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation the Monetary Policy Committee MPC at its meeting today October 9 2020 decided to Consequently the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 335 per cent and the marginal standing facility MSF rate and the Bank Rate at 425 per cent These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the mediumterm target for consumer price index CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of 2 per cent while supporting growth The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below Assessment Global Economy 2 Incoming data point to a recovery in global economic activity in Q3 of 2020 in sequential terms although downside risks have risen with the renewed surge in infections in many countries Global trade is expected to be subdued The rebound could turn out to be stronger among advanced economies AEs than in emerging market economies EMEs Global financial markets remain supported by highly accommodative monetary and liquidity conditions Soft fuel prices and weak aggregate demand have kept inflation below target in AEs although in some EMEs supply disruptions have imparted upward price pressures Domestic Economy 3 On the domestic front high frequency indicators suggest that economic activity is stabilising in Q2202021 after the 239 per cent yearonyear yoy decline in real GDP in Q1 AprilJune Cushioned by government spending and rural demand manufacturing especially consumer nondurables and some categories of services such as passenger vehicles and railway freight have gradually recovered in Q2 The outlook for agriculture is robust With merchandise exports slowly catching up to preCOVID levels and some moderation in the pace of contraction of imports the trade deficit widened marginally sequentially in Q2 4 Headline CPI inflation increased to 67 per cent during JulyAugust 2020 as pressures accentuated across food fuel and core constituents on account of supply disruptions higher margins and taxes One year ahead inflation expectations of households suggest some softening in inflation from three months ahead levels Selling prices of firms remain muted reflecting the weak demand conditions 5 Domestic financial conditions have eased substantially with systemic liquidity remaining in large surplus Reserve money increased by 135 per cent on a yearonyear basis as on October 2 2020 driven by a surge in currency demand 215 per cent Growth in money supply M3 however was contained at 122 per cent as on September 25 2020 Banks nonfood credit growth remains subdued Indias foreign exchange reserves stood at US 5456 billion on October 2 2020 Outlook 6 Turning to the outlook for inflation kharif sowing portends well for food prices Pressures on prices of key vegetables like tomatoes onions and potatoes should also ebb by Q3 with kharif arrivals On the other hand prices of pulses and oilseeds are likely to remain firm due to elevated import duties International crude oil prices have traded with a softening bias in September on a weak demand outlook but domestic pump prices may remain elevated in the absence of any roll back of taxes Pricing power of firms remains weak in the face of subdued demand COVID19related supply disruptions including labour shortages and high transportation costs could continue to impose costpush pressures but these risks are getting mitigated by progressive easing of lockdowns and removal of restrictions on interstate movements Taking into consideration all these factors CPI inflation is projected at 68 per cent for Q2202021 at 5445 per cent for H2202021 and 43 per cent for Q1202122 with risks broadly balanced Chart 1 7 Turning to the growth outlook the recovery in the rural economy is expected to strengthen further while the turnaround in urban demand is likely to be lagged in view of social distancing norms and the elevated number of COVID19 infections While the contactintensive services sector will take time to regain preCOVID levels manufacturing firms expect capacity utilisation to recover in Q3202021 and activity to gain some traction from Q4 onwards Both private investment and exports are likely to be subdued especially as external demand is still anaemic Taking into consideration the above factors and the uncertain COVID19 trajectory real GDP growth in 202021 is expected to be negative at 95 per cent with risks tilted to the downside 98 per cent in Q2202021 56 per cent in Q3 and 05 per cent in Q4 Real GDP growth for Q1202122 is placed at 206 per cent Chart 2 8 The MPC is of the view that revival of the economy from an unprecedented COVID19 pandemic assumes the highest priority in the conduct of monetary policy While inflation has been above the tolerance band for several months the MPC judges that the underlying factors are essentially supply shocks which should dissipate over the ensuing months as the economy unlocks supply chains are restored and activity normalises Accordingly they can be looked through at this juncture while setting the stance of monetary policy Taking into account all these factors the MPC decides to maintain status quo on the policy rate in this meeting and await the easing of inflationary pressures to use the space available for supporting growth further 9 All members of the MPC Dr Shashanka Bhide Dr Ashima Goyal Prof Jayanth R Varma Dr Mridul K Saggar Dr Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID19 on the economy while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward Dr Shashanka Bhide Dr Ashima Goyal Dr Mridul K Saggar Dr Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to continue with this accommodative stance at least during the current financial year and into the next financial year with Prof Jayanth R Varma voting against this formulation 10 The minutes of the MPCs meeting will be published by October 23 2020 Yogesh Dayal Chief General Manager Press

bank loans and advances to these sectors Investments made by banks under this facility will be classified as held to maturity HTM even in excess of 25 percent of total investment permitted to be included in the HTM portfolio All exposures under this facility will also be exempted from reckoning under the large exposure framework LEF Moreover banks that had availed of funds earlier under targeted longterm repo operations TLTRO and TLTRO 20 will be given the option of reversing these transactions before maturity In view of the borrowing requirements of the centre and states in the second half of 202021 and the likely pickup in demand for credit as the recovery gathers strength on tap TLTROs are intended to enable banks to conduct their operations smoothly and seamlessly without being hindered by illiquidity frictions The objective is to ensure that liquidity in the system remains comfortable The details of the scheme would be announced separately 2 SLR Holdings in Held to Maturity HTM category To engender orderly market conditions and ensure congenial financing costs the Reserve Bank on September 1 2020 increased the limits under Held to Maturity HTM category from 195 per cent to 22 percent of NDTL in respect of SLR securities acquired on or after September 1 2020 up to March 31 2021 To give more certainty to the markets about the status of these investments in SLR securities after March 31 2021 it has been decided to extend the dispensation of enhanced HTM limits of 22 percent up to March 31 2022 for securities acquired between September 1 2020 and March 31 2021 The HTM limits would be restored from 22 per cent to 195 percent in a phased manner starting from the quarter ending June 30 2022 It is expected that banks will be able to plan their investments in SLR securities in an optimal manner with a clear glide path for restoration of HTM limits 3 Open Market operations OMOs in State Developments Loans SDLs At present SDLs are eligible collateral for Liquidity Adjustment Facility LAF along with Tbills dated government securities and oil bonds To improve liquidity and facilitate efficient pricing it has been decided to conduct open market operations OMOs in SDLs as a special case during the current financial year The OMOs would be conducted for a basket of SDLs comprising securities issued by states II Support to Exports 4 Automatic Caution Listing of Exporters Review As part of automation of Export Data Processing and Monitoring System EDPMS the Caution Decaution Listing of exporters was automated in 2016 Accordingly the exporters were to be cautionlisted automatically if any shipping bill against them remained outstanding for more than 2 years in EDPMS and no extension was granted for realisation of export proceeds against the outstanding shipping bill Additionally the normal system of cautionlisting based on the recommendations of the Authorised Dealer AD bank before the expiry of 2 years in certain cases continued In order to make the system more exporter friendly and equitable it has been decided to discontinue the Automatic Cautionlisting The Reserve Bank will continue with cautionlisting based on the casespecific recommendations of the AD bank Related instructions in this regard will be issued shortly III Regulatory Measures 5 Regulatory Retail Portfolio Revised Limit for Risk Weight As per the present RBI instructions the exposures included in the regulatory retail portfolio of banks are assigned a risk weight of 75 per cent For this purpose the qualifying exposures need to meet certain specified criteria including low value of individual exposures In terms of the value of exposures it has been prescribed that the maximum aggregated retail exposure to one counterparty should not exceed the absolute threshold limit of 5 crore In order to reduce the cost of credit for this segment consisting of individuals and small businesses ie with turnover of upto 50 crore and in harmonisation with the Basel guidelines it has been decided to increase this threshold to 75 crore in respect of all fresh as well as incremental qualifying exposures This measure is expected to increase the much needed credit flow to the small business segment 6 Individual Housing Loans Rationalisation of Risk Weights In terms of the extant regulations on capital charge for credit risk of individual housing loans by banks differential risk weights are applicable based on the size of the loan as well as the loan to value ratio LTV Recognising the criticality of real estate sector in the economic recovery given its role in employment generation and the interlinkages with other industries it has been decided as a countercyclical measure to rationalise the risk weights by linking them only with LTV ratios for all new housing loans sanctioned up to March 31 2022 Such loans shall attract a risk weight of 35 per cent where LTV is less than or equal to 80 per cent and a risk weight of 50 per cent where LTV is more than 80 per cent but less than or equal to 90 percent This measure is expected to give a fillip to bank lending to the real estate sector IV Financial Inclusion 7 Review of the Coorigination Model The Reserve Bank had in 2018 put in place a framework for coorigination of loans by banks and a category of Non Banking Financial Companies NBFCs for lending to the priority sector subject to certain conditions The arrangement entailed joint contribution of credit at the facility level by both the lenders as also sharing of risks and rewards between them for ensuring appropriate alignment of respective business objectives Based on the feedback received from the stakeholders to better leverage the respective comparative advantages of the banks and NBFCs in a collaborative effort and to improve the flow of credit to the unserved and underserved sector of the economy it has been decided to extend the scheme to all the NBFCs including HFCs to make all priority sector loans eligible for the scheme and give greater operational flexibility to the lending institutions while requiring them to conform to the regulatory guidelines on outsourcing KYC etc The proposed framework will be called as CoLending Model The revised guidelines will be issued by end of October 2020 V Payment and Settlement Systems 8 RoundtheClock availability of Real Time Gross Settlement System RTGS In December 2019 the National Electronic Funds Transfer NEFT system was made available on a 24x7x365 basis and the system has been operating smoothly since then The largevalue RTGS system is currently available for customers from 700 am to 600 pm on all working days of a week except 2nd and 4th Saturdays of the month To support the ongoing efforts aimed at global integration of Indian financial markets facilitate Indias efforts to develop international financial centers and to provide wider payment flexibility to domestic corporates and institutions it has been decided to make available the RTGS system round the clock on all days With this India will be one of the very few countries globally with a 24x7x365 large value real time payment system This facility will be made effective from December 2020 9 Perpetual Validity for Certificate of Authorisation CoA issued to Payment System Operators PSOs Currently the Reserve Bank issues ontap authorisation under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007 to nonbanks issuing Prepaid Payment Instruments PPIs operating White Label ATMs WLAs or the Trade Receivables Discounting Systems TReDS or participating as Bharat Bill Payment Operating Units BBPOUs Authorisation including renewal of authorisation of such PSOs has been largely for specified periods up to five years While such limited period licences were necessitated in the initial period of evolution of the payment system it can lead to business uncertainty for the PSOs and involves avoidable use of regulatory resources in the process of renewal Furthermore the Reserve Banks oversight framework has gradually developed into a more mature and comprehensive system which clearly lays out its oversight expectations and the methodologies adopted for oversight of PSOs To reduce licensing uncertainties and enable PSOs to focus on their business and optimise utilisation of scarce regulatory resources it has been decided to grant authorisation for all PSOs both new applicants as well as existing PSOs on a perpetual basis subject to certain conditions Detailed instructions will be issued separately Yogesh Dayal Chief

4 The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence households inflation expectations corporate sector performance credit conditions the outlook for the industrial services and infrastructure sectors and the projections of professional forecasters The MPC also reviewed in detail staffs macroeconomic projections and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below Resolution 5 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation the Monetary Policy Committee MPC at its meeting today August 6 2020 decided to Consequently the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 335 per cent and the marginal standing facility MSF rate and the Bank Rate at 425 per cent These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the mediumterm target for consumer price index CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of 2 per cent while supporting growth The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below Assessment Global Economy 6 Since the MPC met in May 2020 global economic activity has remained fragile and in retrenchment in several geographies While the uneasy and differentlypaced withdrawal of COVID19 lockdown restrictions in some countries enabled a sequential improvement in high frequency indicators during MayJuly a renewed surge in COVID19 infections in major economies and threats of a second wave of infections appear to have weakened these early signs of revival Contractions in economic activity have been more severe in Q22020 than in Q1 and the nearterm outlook points to a slow uneven and hesitant recovery pushed into the second half of the year with risks steeply slanted to the downside Among advanced economies AEs output in the US and the Euro area underwent a deeper contraction in Q22020 than in the preceding quarter Emerging market economies EMEs are expected to shrink in Q2 as reflected in high frequency indicators 7 Global financial markets have rebounded since endMarch 2020 with intermittent pauses shrugging off the volatility and sharp correction recorded in Q12020 Portfolio flows returned to EMEs in Q2 after a massive reversal though there was moderation in July from the previous months level EME currencies have also appreciated in close comovement tracking weakening of the US dollar Crude oil prices have remained supported on supply cuts by oil producing countries OPEC plus and improved demand prospects on the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions since May Gold prices have rallied to an alltime high on August 5 on the back of safe haven demand In AEs benign fuel prices and soft aggregate demand have kept inflation subdued In many EMEs however costpush pressures arising from supply disruptions and demand revival have shown up in consumer prices in June 2020 Global food prices are elevated across the board Domestic Economy 8 On the domestic front economic activity had started to recover from the lows of AprilMay following the uneven reopening of some parts of the country in June however surges of fresh infections have forced reclamping of lockdowns in several cities and states Consequently several high frequency indicators have levelled off 9 The agricultural sector has emerged as a bright spot Its prospects have strengthened on the back of good spatial and temporal progress of the southwest monsoon The cumulative monsoon rainfall was 1 per cent below the longperiod average LPA up to August 5 2020 Spurred by the expanding precipitation the total area sown under kharif crops on July 31 was 59 per cent higher than the normal area measured by the average over the period 201415 to 201819 As on July 30 2020 the live storage in major reservoirs was 41 per cent of the full reservoir level FRL which bodes well for the rabi season These developments have had a salutary effect on rural demand as reflected in fertiliser production and sales of tractors motorcycles and fastmoving consumer goods 10 The pace of contraction of industrial production measured by the index of industrial production IIP moderated to 347 per cent in May from 576 per cent a month ago with the easing of lockdowns in different parts of the country All manufacturing subsectors except pharmaceuticals remained in negative territory The output of core industries in June contracted for the fourth successive month though with a considerable moderation The Reserve Banks business assessment index BAI for Q1202021 hit its lowest mark in the surveys history The manufacturing PMI remained in contraction shrinking further to 460 in July from 472 in the preceding month 11 High frequency indicators of services sector activity for MayJune indicate signs of a modest resumption of economic activity especially in rural areas although at levels lower than a year ago Notably the decline in passenger vehicle sales moderated to 496 per cent in June from 853 per cent in May indicative of tentative urban demand and faster recovery of sales in rural areas On the other hand domestic air passenger traffic and cargo traffic continued to post sharp contraction Construction activity remained tepid cement production fell and finished steel consumption moderated sharply in June Imports of capital goods a key indicator of investment activity declined further in June The services PMI continued in contractionary zone in July to 342 although the downturn eased relative to the May and June readings 12 The National Statistical Office NSO released data on headline CPI for the month of June 2020 on July 13 2020 along with imputed back prints of the index for April and May 2020 This resulted in a sharp upward revision of food inflation for the month of April and May During Q1202021 food inflation moderated from 105 per cent in April to 73 per cent in June 2020 Meanwhile fuel inflation edged up as international kerosene and LPG prices firmed up Inflation excluding food and fuel was at 54 per cent in June reflecting a spike in prices across most subgroups Inflation in transport and communication personal care and effects pantobacco and education registered significant increases in June Headline CPI inflation which was at 58 per cent in March 2020 was placed at 61 per cent in the provisional estimates for June 2020 13 For the second successive round households three months ahead expectations remained above their one year ahead expectations indicating their anticipation of lower inflation over the longer horizon Producers sentiments on input prices remained muted as their salary outgoes fell Their selling prices contracted in Q1 in the AprilJune round of the Reserve Banks industrial outlook survey The contraction in output prices is also corroborated by firms participating in the manufacturing PMI survey 14 Domestic financial conditions have eased substantially and systemic liquidity remains in large surplus due to the conventional and unconventional measures by the Reserve Bank since February 2020 Cumulatively these measures assured liquidity of the order of 957 lakh crore or 47 per cent of GDP Reflecting these developments reserve money RM increased by 154 per cent on a yearonyear basis as on July 31 2020 driven by a surge in currency demand 231 per cent Growth in money supply M3 however was contained at 124 per cent as on July 17 2020 Average daily net absorptions under the liquidity adjustment facility LAF moderated from 53 lakh crore in May 2020 to 41 lakh crore in June as government spending slowed In July average daily net absorptions under the LAF moderated further to 40 lakh crore as government spending remained subdued During 202021 up to July 31 124154 crore was injected through open market operation OMO purchases In order to distribute liquidity more evenly across the term structure and improve transmission the Reserve Bank conducted operation twist auctions involving the simultaneous sale and purchase of government securities for 10000 crore on July 2 2020 Furthermore the utilisation of refinance provided by the Reserve Bank to the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development NABARD Small Industries Development Bank of India SIDBI and the National Housing Bank NHB increased to 34566 crore on July 31 2020 from 22334 crore during the May policy 15 The transmission to bank lending rates has improved further with the weighted average lending rate WALR on fresh rupee loans declining by 91 bps during MarchJune 2020 The spreads of 3year AAA rated corporate bonds over GSecs of similar maturity declined from 276 bps on March 26 2020 to 50 bps by endJuly 2020 Even for the lowest investment grade bonds BBB spreads have come down by 125 bps by endJuly 2020 Lower borrowing costs have led to record primary issuance of corporate bonds of 21 lakh crore in the first quarter of 202021 16 Indias merchandise exports contracted for the fourth successive month in June 2020 although the pace of fall moderated on improving shipments of agriculture and pharmaceutical products Imports fell sharply in June in a broadbased manner reflecting weak domestic demand and low international crude oil prices The merchandise trade balance recorded a surplus in June US 08 billion after a gap of over 18 years The current account balance turned into a marginal surplus of 01 per cent of GDP in Q4 of 201920 as against a deficit of 07 per cent a year ago On the financing side net foreign direct investment moderated to US 44 billion in AprilMay 2020 from US 72 billion a year ago In 202021 till July 31 net foreign portfolio investment FPI in equities at US 53 billion was higher than US 12 billion a year ago In the debt segment however there were outflows of US 44 billion during the same period as against inflows of US 20 billion a year ago Net investment under the voluntary retention route increased by US 09 billion during the same period Indias foreign exchange reserves have increased by US 568 billion in 202021 so far up to July 31 to US 5346 billion equivalent to 134 months of imports Outlook 17 Supply chain disruptions on account of COVID19 persist with implications for both food and nonfood prices A more favourable food inflation outlook may emerge as the bumper rabi harvest eases prices of cereals especially if open market sales and public distribution offtake are expanded on the back of significantly higher procurement The relatively moderate increases in minimum support prices MSP for the kharif crops and monsoon are also supportive of benign inflation prospects Nonetheless upside risks to food prices remain The abatement of price pressure in key vegetables is delayed and remains contingent upon normalisation of supplies Protein based food items could also emerge as a pressure point given the tight demandsupply balance in the case of pulses The inflation outlook of nonfood categories is however fraught with uncertainty Higher domestic taxes on petroleum products have resulted in elevated domestic pump prices and will impart broadbased costpush pressures going forward Volatility in financial markets and rising asset prices also pose upside risks to the outlook Taking into consideration all these factors headline inflation may remain elevated in Q2202021 but may moderate in H2202021 aided by large favourable base effects 18 Turning to the growth outlook the recovery in the rural economy is expected to be robust buoyed by the progress in kharif sowing Manufacturing firms responding to the Reserve Banks industrial outlook survey expect domestic demand to recover gradually from Q2 and to sustain through Q1202122 On the other hand consumer confidence turned more pessimistic in July relative to the preceding round of the Reserve Banks survey External demand is expected to remain anaemic under the weight of the global recession and contraction in global trade Taking into consideration the above factors real GDP growth in Q2Q4 is expected to evolve along the lines noted in the May resolution For the year 202021 as a whole real GDP growth is expected to be negative An early containment of the COVID19 pandemic may impart an upside to the outlook A more protracted spread of the pandemic deviations from the forecast of a normal monsoon and global financial market volatility are the key downside risks 19 The June release of headline inflation after a gap of two months and imputed prints of the CPI for AprilMay have added uncertainty to the inflation outlook The NSO has adopted best practices in producing these imputations for the purpose of business continuity in the face of challenges to data collection due to the nationwide lockdown The NSO has however not provided inflation rates for April and May For the purpose of monetary formulation and conduct therefore the MPC is of the view that CPI prints for April and May can be regarded as a break in the CPI series 20 The MPC noted that the economy is experiencing unprecedented stress in an austere global environment Extreme uncertainty characterises the outlook which is heavily contingent upon the intensity spread and duration of the pandemic particularly the heightened risks associated with a second wave of infections and the discovery of the vaccine In these conditions supporting the recovery of the economy assumes primacy in the conduct of monetary policy In pursuit of this objective the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID19 on the economy While space for further monetary policy action in support of this stance is available it is important to use it judiciously and opportunistically to maximise the beneficial effects for underlying economic activity 21 At the same time the MPC is conscious that its primary mandate is to achieve the mediumterm target for CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of 2 per cent It also recognises that the headline CPI prints of AprilMay 2020 require more clarity At the current juncture the inflation objective itself is further obscured by a the spike in food prices because of floods in eastern India and ongoing lockdown related disruptions and b costpush pressures in the form of high taxes on petroleum products hikes in telecom charges rising raw material costs reflected in upward revisions in steel prices and rise in gold prices on safe haven demand Given the uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook and taking into consideration the extremely weak state of the economy in the midst of an unprecedented shock from the ongoing pandemic it is prudent to pause and remain watchful of incoming data as to how the outlook unravels 22 Meanwhile the cumulative reduction of 250 basis points since February 2019 is working its way through the economy lowering interest rates in money bond and credit markets and narrowing down spreads Financing conditions have eased considerably enabling financial flows via financial markets especially at a time when banks remain highly risk averse Accordingly the MPC decides to stay on hold with regard to the policy rate and remain watchful for a durable reduction in inflation to use the available space to support the revival of the economy 23 All members of the MPC Dr Chetan Ghate Dr Pami Dua Dr Ravindra H Dholakia Dr Mridul K Saggar Dr Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID19 on the economy while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward 24 The minutes of the MPCs meeting will be published by August 20 2020 Statement by Dr Chetan Ghate 25 Since the last review the economy has seen a gradual rebound in economic activity This is largely mechanical as much of the lockdown in the economy is being undone as policy constraints on the supply side are removed 26 Average CPI headline inflation has been above the target ranges upper bound 6 per cent for the last 6 months 67 per cent between January March 2020 65 per cent between AprilJune 2020 While the NSOs imputed estimates for AprilMay 2020 inflation require more clarity it is clear that just looking at CPI headline inflation in March 2020 58 per cent and June 61 per cent means that the trend is upwards Inflation excluding food and fuel ie core inflation also rose to 54 per cent in June Higher price momentum in most subgroups of core inflation saw some increase in May and June suggesting that core inflation remains high and sticky 27 On the other hand after the April peak food price momentum has subsided which has largely been driven by the decline in cumulative momentum in vegetables This however needs to be carefully watched Both 3month and 1year ahead inflationary expectations increased marginally by 10 basis points to 104 per cent and 105 per cent respectively The levellingoff of inflationary expectations from a steady increase since March 2020 is comforting 28 The prospect of an inflation whipsaw a phrase used by Markus Brunnermeir at Princeton is probably the right way to look at inflation going forward ie there are different inflationdeflation pressures that need to be watched carefully On the upside a perfect storm of cost push pressures accommodative monetary policy and adverse food supply shocks could lead to a pickup in inflation On the downside the paradox of thrift ie forced saving pressure induced by a defacto lockdown could be a potent disinflationary force 29 In terms of output losses my assessment is that the worst is almost surely behind us notwithstanding second waves of the pandemic etc 30 Economic crosscurrents however make it difficult to diagnose precisely the underlying damage because of the virus over the next year 31 Real GDP growth in Q4 FY 20 based on provisional estimates produced by the NSO is now pegged at 31 per cent This is the weakest print in the new data series that started in 20122013 The complete year FY20 real GDP growth is 42 per cent which is also the weakest in the series Netting out government expenditures contribution in Q4 FY20 private demand growth remains anaemic Consumption growth for instance in FY 20 was 53 per cent compared to 72 per cent in FY 1819 and 81 per cent in FY 1617 In FY 21 these numbers will be compounded by idiosyncratic shocks to particular sectors because of Covid aviation tourism where the policy response has not been adequate 32 Credit growth continues to remain muted despite large rate cuts I worry that a negative credit supply shock to the MSME sector may lead to a creditgap ie a reduction in the supply of credit to small firms leading to small businesses to shift towards higher cost providers of credit This will have a bearing on growth Some of these issues have begun to be addressed in amendments to the recently announced ECLGS scheme by the government I worry though that if credit continues to be expensive these firms will become less capital intensive over time leading to a lower marginal product of labour The long run equilibrium for the economy will involve a negative impact on wages and therefore demand 33 Some high frequency indicators however have begun to turn in June To name a few the Index of Industrial Production IIP PMI services PMI manufacturing electricity output some rural demand indicators like tractor sales and GST collections have retreated from their earlier lows in AprilMay A tentative global recovery is also happening The distribution of rainfall has overall been positive Monetary transmission has also improved This is crucial given the close connection between sovereign yields and funding conditions in the economy For instance between MarchJuly 2020 the policy repo rate was cut by 115 bps The WALR for fresh rupee loans during this period declined by 91 bps Despite this I worry though that given that there is a lot of uncertainty on the investment side the option value of waiting will be big which will delay the onset of investment spending 34 There are other risks due to Covid that pose downside risks to growth in the medium run 35 For instance Covid is simultaneously a negative demand and a negative supply shock Macro policy broadly must ensure that a temporary Covid type shock to the Indian economy does not become permanent Economists call this hysteresis In a postCovid world as Olivier Blanchard notes hysteresis will be driven by human behaviour Despite the economy opening up people will still hesitate to go out and spend This will limit the effects of unlocking the economy 36 I continue to maintain that the major brunt of future fiscal stimuli should be tilted towards social insurance payments and on the taxation side where the multipliers are larger It is important to recognize that fiscal multipliers depend on country characteristics They are smaller in countries with flexible exchange rate regimes open to trade and with high levels of public debt India has all three Fiscal multipliers may be larger at the zero lower bound but India is not there yet Prices are also more flexible in developing countries like India because of the presence of a large informal sector This weakens the transmission of fiscal policy from financial markets to the real economy Fiscal stimulus design will have to keep these factors in mind and will have a strong bearing on the type of cyclical recovery that the economy experiences Economic policy is a potent tool for equilibrium selection at the current juncture 37 This should be a crisis that is not wasted The government must continue to focus on much needed structural reforms Some fiscal space should be reserved for later outbreaks 38 Given the above reasons it would be opportune to wait and watch to see how the growthinflation numbers pan out over the next few months I therefore vote to pause I also vote to retain the stance as accommodative 39 I should mention that I have been advocating a more cautious path for policy rate reductions since February 2019 However I have been in a minority in the MPC Inflation has now been above the upper band of 6 per cent for a number of months Notwithstanding large rate cuts to spur growth over the last year and a half growth has steadily declined despite 250 bps in cuts since February 2019 Future MPCs should not go soft on inflation Going forward monetary and fiscal policy will be needed to be used wisely with a clear understanding of what and what not they can achieve in terms of controlling inflation smoothening out the business cycle and limiting spurious economic volatility 40 I have been contributing to the setting of monetary policy since February 2013 first on the TAC and now on the MPC I want to thank the Reserve Bank of India and the Government of India for giving me this opportunity Statement by Dr Pami Dua 41 Since the last policy meeting CPI headline inflation prints have been released for three months April May and June of which the numbers for April and May are imputed The provisional data for June shows headline inflation of 61 per cent compared to 58 per cent in March Food inflation moderated somewhat from 78 per cent in March to 73 per cent in June while rising in the interim to 105 per cent and 84 per cent in April and May respectively Fuel inflation rose slightly from 16 per cent in May to 27 per cent in June reflecting the increase in international LPG and kerosene prices although it was lower than the March level of 66 per cent CPI inflation excluding food and fuel rose from 39 per cent in March to 54 per cent in June portraying the increase in inflation in transport and communication personal care and effects pantobacco and education 42 Going forward a bumper rabi winter crop and a moderate increase in minimum support prices for the kharif crops along with overall demand compression augur well for inflation At the same time however upside risks to inflation include pressure on vegetable prices continued supply chain disruptions high taxes on petroleum products resulting in costpush pressures uncertainty regarding price changes in nonfood categories rising asset prices and volatility in financial markets The headline print is expected to remain elevated in Q2202021 and then moderate in the second half of FY 202021 due to favourable base effects This conforms with both the May and July 2020 rounds of the Inflation Expectations Survey of Households conducted by the Reserve Bank of India that show higher inflation expectations for the threemonthsahead forecasts compared to forecasts for the oneyearahead horizon 43 On the domestic output front some signs of recovery were visible in June following the partial unlocking of some parts of the country The ensuing increase in the number of new cases of COVID19 however forced the restitution of localised lockdowns restraining growth in some high frequency indicators Some indicators of urban consumption demand passenger vehicle sales domestic passenger air traffic and consumer durables picked up slightly but continued to remain in deep contraction On the other hand some signs of recovery were evident in high frequency indicators of rural demand tractor sales motorcycle sales and production of consumer nondurables High frequency indicators of investment demand remained weak including consumption of finished steel import of capital goods and capital goods production as per the usebased classification of IIP although the yearonyear contraction in cement production eased considerably in June Contraction in IIP yearonyear moderated to 347 per cent in May 2020 from 576 per cent in the previous month due to the easing of lockdowns Within manufacturing only pharmaceuticals witnessed positive growth 44 The Purchasing Managers Index PMI for manufacturing continued in the contraction zone dropping to 460 in July from 472 in the preceding month The PMI for services also continued in the contractionary zone while edging up to 342 in July although contracting much less than in April and May High frequency indicators of the services sector under construction and trade hotels and transport steel consumption cement production passenger vehicle sales domestic passenger air traffic railway freight traffic and commercial vehicle sales contracted in June Within financial and professional services nonfood credit growth remained muted 45 Fortunately growth in agriculture has held up with the total area under summer crops kharif including rice pulses coarse cereals oilseeds cotton and sugarcane up by 139 per cent as on July 31 2020 over the corresponding period of last year and by 59 per cent over the normal area 5 years average 46 The Consumer Confidence Survey conducted by RBI in July 2020 shows that the overall Current Situation Index is at a historic low while the Future Expectations Index reflects some optimism for the year ahead 47 On the external front the pace of contraction of Indias exports growth slowed down in June to 124 per cent from 43 per cent during March to May Imports growth however dropped by 476 per cent in June 48 At the global level the global manufacturing PMI and the global services PMI increased to 503 and 505 respectively in July and moved back to the expansion zone 49 The prognosis for the economic situation is thus highly uncertain There are some signs of revival but the restoration of economic activity depends on how soon supply disruptions are repaired and demand revives This depends amongst other factors on the severity of the evolving pandemic in terms of its depth duration and diffusion and the control of infections as well as the development of a vaccine 50 Clearly it is important to revive the economy and mitigate the impact of the COVID19 pandemic in line with the objective of monetary policy to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth It is thus prudent to continue with the accommodative stance of monetary policy At the same time the mandate of the MPC is to achieve the target of CPI inflation combined of 4 per cent with the upper tolerance limit of 6 per cent and the lower tolerance bound of 2 per cent 51 In its attempts to revive the economy the MPC has already front loaded cuts in the policy rate In fact before the COVID19 pandemic hit the Indian economy the policy repo rate was reduced by 135 basis points between February and October 2019 in response to the slowdown in economic activity Since the outbreak of the pandemic the repo rate was further cut by 75 basis points in the March MPC meeting and 40 basis points in the May meeting amounting to a total cut of 250 basis points between February 2019 and May 2020 and 115 basis points between March and May 2020 The monetary policy transmission to lending rates of banks has also improved with a 91 basis points decline in the weighted average lending rate WALR on fresh rupee loans between March and June 2020 However at the present juncture the outlook for inflation is also uncertain with risks more on the upside Some clarity is also required with respect to the imputation of the April and May prints In this context CPI inflation data for at least two or three more months will be crucial for clearly gauging the impact of supply side disruptions and demand conditions on prices 52 Considering the above factors at this juncture it is best to adopt a wait and watch strategy and look forward to incoming data to assess the evolving macroeconomic situation I therefore vote to keep the policy rate unchanged and to continue with an accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID19 on the economy while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward Statement by Dr Ravindra H Dholakia 53 After the last MPC meeting in May 2020 changes in the economic environment were along the expected lines except the official announcement about the headline CPI and implicit inflation numbers during April May and June These high inflation prints coupled with the apprehensions about GDP growth likely to be negative both in real terms and nominal terms would imply that the economy is not caught up in recession with deflation but in a deep stagflation which occurs when the adverse supply shock is more severe than the demand shock Under such circumstances expansionary aggregate demand policies both monetary and fiscal would result first in fueling inflation further rather than output and employment expansion and growth recovery which is expected under recession with deflation I have strong reservations in accepting the implicit inflation numbers for April and May announced by the NSO I would therefore like to wait and watch for more reliable and realistic estimates of the headline inflation before taking any decision on the policy rate I vote for status quo both on the policy repo rate and the stance More specific reasons for my vote are as follows Price quotations collected for various items from the designated shops by NSO to measure inflation could not be collected during April and May because of the nationwide lockdown Even for June the sample was not satisfactory to prepare the estimates for different states Instead of leaving the gap in the CPI series the NSO decided to impute the CPI values for April and May as suggested by the business continuity guidelines issued by a group of six international agencies that resulted in the implicit headline inflation of 72 percent for April and 63 percent for May from 58 percent for March On the other hand inflation based on the CPI for Industrial Workers released by the Labour Bureau that has a very high degree of correlation with CPIC prepared by NSO for the months of March April and May are respectively 550 545 and 510 percent Similarly WPI the index used to measure inflation in India till 2014 based inflation rates for March April and May are respectively 042 157 and 321 percent Thus the imputed CPI and inflation rates implied by them do not seem to be consistent with the alternative measures not only in terms of the magnitude but also in the direction of change Moreover I have been expressing serious concerns over the mismeasurement of inflation in our country see The Report of the Sixth Central Pay Commission 2008 and my article in Economic and Political Weekly Nov17 2018 by the fixed baseweighted index with limited number of consumption items instead of the chainbase weighted index method followed in the developed countries In an extreme situation created by the nationwide lockdown for months the consumption pattern in the country has significantly and substantially changed This would simply not be reflected in the measurement of our headline inflation based on the fixed baseweighted index even if all price quotations were available and would provide an unrealistic measurement of inflation Imputation of the headline inflation numbers ignoring all such limitations when used in forecasting models and policy simulation exercises may misrepresent and provide misleading signals It is therefore prudent to ignore them and wait for more reliable measurements and estimates The household survey rounds for inflationary expectations carried out in May and July 2020 provide very interesting results When the standard errors are considered there was no statistically significant difference between May and July rounds of the survey in the three months ahead and one year ahead inflationary expectation of households Similarly in the July round of the survey there is no statistically significant difference between the current perception of inflation and one year ahead inflationary expectations of the households though the difference between three months ahead inflationary expectations and the current perception of inflation is statistically significant This suggests that the urban households expect faster recovery of aggregate demand over the aggregate supply in the short run but expect the supply to recover faster in the long run reducing the inflationary pressures On the other hand the RBIs industrial outlook survey shows that manufacturing firms expect domestic demand to recover gradually from Q2202021 and sustain through Q1202122 Producers expected their input prices and costs to remain low and their selling prices actually contracted during AprilJune 2020 Similarly the consumer confidence survey conducted by RBI also does not paint any optimistic picture 54 Thus there are high uncertainties and some contradictory evidences about the characterization of the current and future macroeconomic environment I am sceptical about the deep stagflationary conditions prevailing in the country Although the present circumstances are truly exceptional the primary mandate given to MPC for inflation targeting at 4 percent with the upper tolerance limit of 6 percent has to be respected In fact the confusion and uncertainty created by the imputed CPIC and implied inflation estimates needs to be cleared by more of regular readings on inflation rates Since the transmission of the policy rate cuts to the money bond and credit markets has been commendable but not complete there is no harm in taking a pause at this juncture In my view the available space for policy rate should now be used prudently and opportunistically to optimize the impact on the economic recovery Hence I vote for a status quo on the policy stance and rate Statement by Dr Mridul K Saggar 55 For purposes of transparent communication it will be useful to explicitly recognise that monetary policy is being framed under considerable uncertainty at the current juncture The depth of the gorge created by the unprecedentedly deep pandemic shock is difficult to measure The underlying data is populated from incomplete and less reliable information due to missing data larger sampling and nonsampling errors Unusual revisions are likely down the line Forecast uncertainty is compounded by the future course the pandemic might take With medical solutions yet to be found it is difficult to anticipate the output loss that might occur from further waves of infections even as path to normalisation has begun 56 Growth estimates for 202021 are difficult to arrive at the current juncture but there could be a downward bias to the present consensus estimates when the final data becomes available Inflation on the other hand may have an upward bias The recovery path is inextricably linked to the course the pandemic might take and complete normalisation will be difficult till pandemic is overcome High frequency indicators of real activity show that contractions have turned smaller in May and still smaller in June as activity recovers from the severe lockdown in April Recovery in GST including through Eway bills railway freight port cargo cement production and petroleum consumption has been particularly encouraging However with the notable exceptions of electricity and tractors all other indicators remained in red in June with levels at least 15 per cent below that in February Vehicle registrations railway and airline passenger traffic remain abysmally low in face of travel restrictions Anecdotal evidence from industry sources suggest that activity levels might improve only marginally in July This signals that it may be hard to recover the last 10 per cent of the production given that the Covid19 curve has not flattened yet The disruption caused by it will leave hysteresis implying some permanent damage to potential output even after pandemic recedes although speedy policy action has contained this impairment In these circumstances the MPC has been rightfully mindful of growth as well within the flexible inflation targeting framework It has taken actions with a view to prevent output collapse that could otherwise have had lasting impact 57 Inflation statistics in the pandemic period have elements of fuzziness Statistical authorities had to resort to imputation method in face of lockdown and had not released the headline inflation for the month of April and May Itemlevel data is also not available for MarchJune However the June data shows that inflation is above the upper tolerance level when the markets coverage in price statistics had improved to 88 per cent of the usual coverage up from 52 per cent in April Quotations coverage could be relatively lower It is not clear if the full coverage would have made a difference to the headline number However the best judgment that I can exercise with available information is that nonmonetary factors may have led the headline inflation persisting above the acceptable band for most of the months since December but monetary factors may also be contributing to the elevated inflation Exfood and fuel inflation was at 54 per cent in June However this core component itself has been driven high by certain elements that may not be contributing to true inflation For instance gold that enters into personal care and effects segment may have contributed about 34 bps to the headline inflation if one were to proximate it by gold prices in the market Exfood fuel and estimated gold inflation was likely in the vicinity of 51 per cent Consumption of gold had dropped but the CPI index is driven by Laspeyres or baseyear consumption weights and not Paasche or current consumption weights The bias on this count however could be nonmaterial as high food inflation may have been accompanied by higher current consumption of food in the overall basket 58 The question relevant for the policy is how long food inflation might stay high and are we seeing signs of generalisation Food inflation should soften as food stock levels are well above norms monsoon is shaping normal reservoir levels are reasonable and kharif sowing has been brisk However the drivers of food inflation include proteinrich food subgroups and as is evident from retail price data from the Department of Consumer Affairs also tomatoes and potato Price rise in proteinrich items has significant demand component Moreover rise in food prices even though predominantly caused by supply disruption runs the risks of generalisation to keep headline inflation higher than is being anticipated The incipient signs of generalisation have also been aided by higher excise and VAT on petroproducts Higher diesel prices have implications for transportation costs Risks to inflation arise from price stickiness and supply chain disruptions high costs of rebuilding or modifying supply chains and less than competitive markets under lockdowns translating into higher retail margins As such it remains to be seen how much inflation falls later in the year due to demand destruction base effects and improved agriculture supplies 59 In my view with considerable policy rate reduction effected since February 2019 and liquidity and credit easing getting frontloaded since March 2020 a breather is necessary awaiting greater clarity The transmission of rate cuts has picked up in the preceding quarter Liquidity infusions have reduced financial market spreads on corporate paper of various tenors and credit quality especially of corporate bonds whose issuance has risen During July the AllIndia financial institutions and Housing Finance Companies have been able to raise money through Commercial Papers at a weighted average rate below the reverse repo rate and corporates and NBFCs at below repo rate Further rate reductions may come in the way of smoothening of interest rate movements unless durable reduction in path of inflation materialises While markets and fundamentals seldom do a tango a disconnect between the two carry the risks of disruptive market corrections Policy needs to be mindful of the space that may be needed to deal with possibility of increased stress that may resurface later with loan defaults and recognition of bad loans Impact of fiscal actions and space also need to be closely observed for demand management Growth is at risk over the medium term if we sacrifice macrofinancial stability for shortrun expediency Moreover there is sound rationale that monetary policymakers should do less under uncertainty While pausing it is best to retain the accommodative stance as long as the baseline suggests that inflation will soften to well within the tolerance band keeping in view the need to avoid frequent directional changes even as policy remains data dependent Also confidence levels are currently fragile and monetary transmission of earlier rate reduction is still in pipeline 60 Considering all of above I vote for leaving the policy rate unchanged and maintaining accommodative stance as communicated in the resolution that emphasises need for continued support to growth while remaining watchful for a durable reduction in inflation to use the available space so as to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward Statement by Dr Michael Debabrata Patra 61 From the time of the outbreak of the pandemic the setting of monetary policy by the monetary policy committee MPC has involved the assignment of a more than proportionate weight to growth relative to inflation The severe contractions in various sectors of the economy in the first half of 202021 so far vindicate this weighting scheme 62 Disappointingly however inflation surprises of recent months are undermining the MPCs actions and stymieing its resolve to do what it takes to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID19 on the economy The unanticipated concoction of imputations of the consumer price index CPI for April and May 2020 supply disruptions and unrelenting cost push interventions in price formation that have reared up outside the ambit of monetary policy has complicated its conduct especially as the inflation levitation seems to show persistence 63 Amidst the high uncertainty characterising the nearterm outlook two outcomes are possible drawing from precedents alone There can be a good outcome based on the 201617 experience when a combination of delayed market arrivals and riskminimising supply management caused food inflation which had risen to 80 per cent in July of that year to fall off a cliff in the next month August itself For the year as a whole headline inflation averaged 45 per cent in spite of some hysteresis in core inflation There can also be a bad outcome as in 200910 when awash with stimulus a buildup of domestic inflationary pressures and inflation expectations occurred on the back of surging food prices in the backdrop of a failed monsoon and it spilled over into other components Monetary policy action was delayed on the ground of nurturing nascent growth impulses inflation became generalised and 13 consecutive policy rate increases could not excoriate inflations pernicious hold The 2009 experience has striking similarities with what confronts us today There is one important difference though in 200910 India rebounded out of the global financial crisis and its real GDP growth was strong at close to 8 per cent In 202021 Indias real GDP is widely expected to record its deepest contraction in history There is also an important lesson from the 200910 experience in India food prices are the true core of inflation dynamics They can and do get persistent and generalised into wider macroeconomic instability 64 At the current juncture with inflation prints above the upper tolerance band technical considerations under the monetary policy framework warrant a preoccupation with dealing with the conditions of failure All this after a period of four years of uninterrupted success in keeping inflation well within the tolerance band and in fact closely aligned with the target which has earned the country credibility in monetary policy conduct investor confidence and the anchoring of expectations Consequently monetary policy is forced into a standstill even when there is space available to persevere with its commitment to reinvigorate growth momentum and alleviate the effects of COVID19 In fact if inflation persists above the upper tolerance band for one more quarter monetary policy will be constrained by mandate to undertake remedial action including an immediate and more than proportionate response to head off the buildup of inflation pressures and prevent it from getting generalised The question is can the economy withstand it in this virusravaged debilitated state The MPC has already signalled its concern in its stance by resolving to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward It has also expressed the unanimous view that for the purpose of monetary formulation and conduct CPI prints for April and May can be regarded as a break in the CPI series 65 The outlook is grim even when it improves the expectation is one of slow hesitant recovery with the situation likely to worsen before it gets better The upticks that easing of lockdowns yield are likely to be ephemeral and vulnerable to flattening out due to lack of underlying vigour A durable revival of the economy depends on sustained policy support to resuscitate activity in various sectors restore employment and livelihood to the displaced and dispossessed continue to assure health support and pursuit of the vaccine ease financial stresses facing households businesses and financial intermediaries instil confidence and anchor financial stability before it slips away This underscores the urgency of unshackling monetary policy from extraneous nonpandemic constraints emerging out of inadequate and lagged reactions in terms of supply management In the absence of this coordinated strategy monetary policy will be left with no option but to adhere to its primary mandate of the MPC which is after all achieving the mediumterm target for consumer price index CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of 2 per cent while supporting growth 66 At this juncture therefore I vote for status quo on the policy rate I reiterate that abstracting from the exogenous shocks to inflation mentioned earlier the state of the economy warrants that the MPC should continue to maintain its accommodative stance while ensuring that inflation returns to the target Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das 67 The outlook for the domestic economy remains extremely uncertain as the impact of COVID19 is more severe than initial assessments and the global economy remains vulnerable to renewed surge in community infections and fears of a second wave While the US and the Euro area registered recordsetting contraction in output in Q22020 the emerging market economies EMEs also look set to see large declines in output Even as high frequency indicators suggest some momentum in July the nearterm outlook remains uninspiring with large downside risks In this backdrop relatively buoyant global financial markets demonstrate not just a disconnect with underlying economic fundamentals but also portend financial stability risks particularly for EMEs 68 Recent data releases on sale of automobiles wholesale electricity generation and issuance of eway bills indicated that a moderate recovery was taking place in the domestic economy Indicators relating to investment like cement and steel production saw some moderation in the pace of contraction to 69 percent and 338 percent respectively in June as compared to the previous two months cement contracted by 214 per cent in May and 853 per cent in April while steel contracted by 431 per cent in May and 787 per cent in April Lately however it is seen that the nascent signs of recovery in June following the gradual resumption of activity in the country have again slumped after a renewed spate of infections forced reimposition of lockdowns in several states and cities The agriculture sector remains a beacon of hope The progress of the southwest monsoon in terms of wider coverage and intensity along with the significant increase in the total area sown under kharif crops augur well for the rural economy as reflected in fertiliser production and sales of tractors motorcycles and fastmoving consumer goods Robust agricultural production would not only have a salutary impact on rural demand but also should help easing of the inflationary pressure from food prices going ahead 69 The July 13 2020 NSO press release on CPI which published the imputed headline CPI index for April and May along with the provisional headline inflation number for June brought about a significant change in assessment of the inflation trajectory for Q1202021 and added uncertainty to the inflation outlook Though the NSO has adopted best practices in imputing CPI for the months of April and May the CPI prints for April and May obscure a realistic assessment of the inflationary momentum and can be regarded as a break in the CPI series for monetary policy formulation 70 Imputed food inflation for AprilMay 2020 showed a sharp upward revision compared to earlier releases The June 2020 CPI showed food inflation remaining at an elevated level While vegetables inflation moderated inflationary pressures in proteinbased food items and cereals got entrenched Further price inflation in spices and oils and fats which was already elevated prelockdown remained in double digits Moreover imputed CPI excluding food and fuel inflation during AprilMay surged by 90100 bps from March readings They were seen to accentuate further in June due to inflationary pressures in pan tobacco and intoxicants transportation and communication and personal care and effects subgroups among others Consequently headline inflation remained above 6 per cent in June Inflation expectation of households as polled in the Reserve Banks July 2020 round of survey rose marginally by 10 bps for 3month and 1year ahead horizons One year ahead expectations were however lower than the 3month ahead expectations suggesting lower inflation expectations over the longer horizon 71 In the recent months the major drivers of inflation have been supplychain disruptions resulting from localised lockdown increase in excise duty and VAT on petroleum products price pressures in protein rich items and vegetables and impact of statistical imputations Looking ahead headline inflation is expected to remain elevated in Q2202021 due to inflationary pressures in both food as well as core inflation Nearterm price pressures in CPI excluding food and fuel continue due to costpush factors and lockdown related production and supplychain disruptions even as aggregate demand conditions register sharp contraction in the post COVID19 scenario 72 The generalised inflationary pressures across food and CPI excluding food and fuel in a situation where growth is expected to contract sharply is a matter of serious concern The surveybased measures of slack in the economy testify that there is little risk to inflation from demand side Given that supply disruptions and bottlenecks in the postCOVID environment are key factors in engendering these inflationary impulses the containment of it calls for proactive sectorspecific supplyside measures In case of edible oils this would entail augmenting imports to meet domestic shortfall and rationalisation of import duties For pulses also imports may have to be continued to the extent of domestic supply shortfall Further if open market sales and public distribution offtake of cereals are expanded on the back of significantly higher procurement it would help in easing of cereal price pressures during the latter part of the year As the economy recovers some rebalancing of the duty structure on petroleum products can ease some of the costpush pressures on the economy Such timely policy intervention to ameliorate supply side concerns along with prospects of a normal monsoon and large favourable base effects could result in moderation in inflation during H2202021 73 Regarding growth outlook the rural economy is expected to be robust while industrial and services activity may recover gradually The recovery out of current slowdown which is mainly conditioned by supply disruptions and compression of consumption demand especially on nonessential goods and services would depend on the containment of Covid pandemic and unlocking of economic activities Rural indicators led by good monsoon higher kharif sowing and Governmentled initiatives to provide employment in the rural areas have shown sharp revival which if sustained can provide support to demand going forward High frequency indicators however suggest that private consumption which is the mainstay of aggregate demand remains subdued Certain crucial sectors such as tourism hospitality and entertainment will take some time to recover Consumer confidence as captured from the Reserve Banks July 2020 survey is low however one year ahead expectations have improved and indicate some optimism External demand is expected to remain frail Manufacturing firms responding to the Reserve Banks industrial outlook survey however expect domestic demand to recover gradually from Q2202021 and to sustain through Q1202122 Low capacity utilisation amid subdued domestic and external demand is likely to delay early revival of investment demand In view of the above real GDP is likely to shrink in the first half of the year and growth for the full year 202021 is estimated to be negative 74 In an environment of extreme stress and uncertain outlook the Reserve Banks proactive management of liquidity through both conventional and unconventional measures undertaken since February 2020 have cumulatively infused liquidity to the extent of 957 lakh crore 47 per cent of GDP and have alleviated stress on the domestic financial conditions Comfortable liquidity conditions in turn have helped improve monetary transmission in consonance with the MPCs accommodative stance and actions and borrowing costs in financial markets have plummeted to their lowest levels in a decade The weighted average lending rate WALR on fresh rupee loans sanctioned by banks declined by 162 basis points during February 2019June 2020 of which 91 basis points transmission was witnessed during MarchJune 2020 75 As I have been reiterating since October 2019 monetary policy is geared towards supporting the economic recovery process Although there is headroom for further monetary policy action at this juncture it is important to keep our arsenal dry and use it judiciously I also feel that we should wait for some more time for the cumulative 250 basis points reduction in policy rate since February 2019 to seep into the financial system and further reduce interest rates and spreads Given the uncertain inflation outlook we have to remain watchful to see that the momentum in inflation does not get entrenched which is also dependent on effective supplyside measures As the economy continues to be in a fragile state recovery in growth assumes primacy It would be prudent at this stage to wait for a firmer assessment of the outlook for growth and inflation as the staggered opening of the economy progresses supply bottlenecks ease and the price reporting pattern stabilises Considering all these aspects I vote for a pause on the policy rate at this moment while continuing with the accommodative stance Yogesh Dayal Chief General Manager Press Release 20202021214

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=50175,Date Monetary Policy Statement 202021 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee MPC August 4 to 6 2020,On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation the Monetary Policy Committee MPC at its meeting today August 6 2020 decided to Consequently the reverse repo rate under the LAF remains unchanged at 335 per cent and the marginal standing facility MSF rate and the Bank Rate at 425 per cent These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the mediumterm target for consumer price index CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of 2 per cent while supporting growth The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below Assessment Global Economy 2 Since the MPC met in May 2020 global economic activity has remained fragile and in retrenchment in several geographies While the uneasy and differentlypaced withdrawal of COVID19 lockdown restrictions in some countries enabled a sequential improvement in high frequency indicators during MayJuly a renewed surge in COVID19 infections in major economies and threats of a second wave of infections appear to have weakened these early signs of revival Contractions in economic activity have been more severe in Q22020 than in Q1 and the nearterm outlook points to a slow uneven and hesitant recovery pushed into the second half of the year with risks steeply slanted to the downside Among advanced economies AEs output in the US and the Euro area underwent a deeper contraction in Q22020 than in the preceding quarter Emerging market economies EMEs are expected to shrink in Q2 as reflected in high frequency indicators 3 Global financial markets have rebounded since endMarch 2020 with intermittent pauses shrugging off the volatility and sharp correction recorded in Q12020 Portfolio flows returned to EMEs in Q2 after a massive reversal though there was moderation in July from the previous months level EME currencies have also appreciated in close comovement tracking weakening of the US dollar Crude oil prices have remained supported on supply cuts by oil producing countries OPEC plus and improved demand prospects on the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions since May Gold prices have rallied to an alltime high on August 5 on the back of safe haven demand In AEs benign fuel prices and soft aggregate demand have kept inflation subdued In many EMEs however costpush pressures arising from supply disruptions and demand revival have shown up in consumer prices in June 2020 Global food prices are elevated across the board Domestic Economy 4 On the domestic front economic activity had started to recover from the lows of AprilMay following the uneven reopening of some parts of the country in June however surges of fresh infections have forced reclamping of lockdowns in several cities and states Consequently several high frequency indicators have levelled off 5 The agricultural sector has emerged as a bright spot Its prospects have strengthened on the back of good spatial and temporal progress of the southwest monsoon The cumulative monsoon rainfall was 1 per cent below the longperiod average LPA up to August 5 2020 Spurred by the expanding precipitation the total area sown under kharif crops on July 31 was 59 per cent higher than the normal area measured by the average over the period 201415 to 201819 As on July 30 2020 the live storage in major reservoirs was 41 per cent of the full reservoir level FRL which bodes well for the rabi season These developments have had a salutary effect on rural demand as reflected in fertiliser production and sales of tractors motorcycles and fastmoving consumer goods 6 The pace of contraction of industrial production measured by the index of industrial production IIP moderated to 347 per cent in May from 576 per cent a month ago with the easing of lockdowns in different parts of the country All manufacturing subsectors except pharmaceuticals remained in negative territory The output of core industries in June contracted for the fourth successive month though with a considerable moderation The Reserve Banks business assessment index BAI for Q1202021 hit its lowest mark in the surveys history The manufacturing PMI remained in contraction shrinking further to 460 in July from 472 in the preceding month 7 High frequency indicators of services sector activity for MayJune indicate signs of a modest resumption of economic activity especially in rural areas although at levels lower than a year ago Notably the decline in passenger vehicle sales moderated to 496 per cent in June from 853 per cent in May indicative of tentative urban demand and faster recovery of sales in rural areas On the other hand domestic air passenger traffic and cargo traffic continued to post sharp contraction Construction activity remained tepid cement production fell and finished steel consumption moderated sharply in June Imports of capital goods a key indicator of investment activity declined further in June The services PMI continued in contractionary zone in July to 342 although the downturn eased relative to the May and June readings 8 The National Statistical Office NSO released data on headline CPI for the month of June 2020 on July 13 2020 along with imputed back prints of the index for April and May 2020 This resulted in a sharp upward revision of food inflation for the month of April and May During Q1202021 food inflation moderated from 105 per cent in April to 73 per cent in June 2020 Meanwhile fuel inflation edged up as international kerosene and LPG prices firmed up Inflation excluding food and fuel was at 54 per cent in June reflecting a spike in prices across most subgroups Inflation in transport and communication personal care and effects pantobacco and education registered significant increases in June Headline CPI inflation which was at 58 per cent in March 2020 was placed at 61 per cent in the provisional estimates for June 2020 9 For the second successive round households three months ahead expectations remained above their one year ahead expectations indicating their anticipation of lower inflation over the longer horizon Producers sentiments on input prices remained muted as their salary outgoes fell Their selling prices contracted in Q1 in the AprilJune round of the Reserve Banks industrial outlook survey The contraction in output prices is also corroborated by firms participating in the manufacturing PMI survey 10 Domestic financial conditions have eased substantially and systemic liquidity remains in large surplus due to the conventional and unconventional measures by the Reserve Bank since February 2020 Cumulatively these measures assured liquidity of the order of 957 lakh crore or 47 per cent of GDP Reflecting these developments reserve money RM increased by 154 per cent on a yearonyear basis as on July 31 2020 driven by a surge in currency demand 231 per cent Growth in money supply M3 however was contained at 124 per cent as on July 17 2020 Average daily net absorptions under the liquidity adjustment facility LAF moderated from 53 lakh crore in May 2020 to 41 lakh crore in June as government spending slowed In July average daily net absorptions under the LAF moderated further to 40 lakh crore as government spending remained subdued During 202021 up to July 31 124154 crore was injected through open market operation OMO purchases In order to distribute liquidity more evenly across the term structure and improve transmission the Reserve Bank conducted operation twist auctions involving the simultaneous sale and purchase of government securities for 10000 crore on July 2 2020 Furthermore the utilisation of refinance provided by the Reserve Bank to the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development NABARD Small Industries Development Bank of India SIDBI and the National Housing Bank NHB increased to 34566 crore on July 31 2020 from 22334 crore during the May policy 11 The transmission to bank lending rates has improved further with the weighted average lending rate WALR on fresh rupee loans declining by 91 bps during MarchJune 2020 The spreads of 3year AAA rated corporate bonds over GSecs of similar maturity declined from 276 bps on March 26 2020 to 50 bps by endJuly 2020 Even for the lowest investment grade bonds BBB spreads have come down by 125 bps by endJuly 2020 Lower borrowing costs have led to record primary issuance of corporate bonds of 21 lakh crore in the first quarter of 202021 12 Indias merchandise exports contracted for the fourth successive month in June 2020 although the pace of fall moderated on improving shipments of agriculture and pharmaceutical products Imports fell sharply in June in a broadbased manner reflecting weak domestic demand and low international crude oil prices The merchandise trade balance recorded a surplus in June US 08 billion after a gap of over 18 years The current account balance turned into a marginal surplus of 01 per cent of GDP in Q4 of 201920 as against a deficit of 07 per cent a year ago On the financing side net foreign direct investment moderated to US 44 billion in AprilMay 2020 from US 72 billion a year ago In 202021 till July 31 net foreign portfolio investment FPI in equities at US 53 billion was higher than US 12 billion a year ago In the debt segment however there were outflows of US 44 billion during the same period as against inflows of US 20 billion a year ago Net investment under the voluntary retention route increased by US 09 billion during the same period Indias foreign exchange reserves have increased by US 568 billion in 202021 so far up to July 31 to US 5346 billion equivalent to 134 months of imports Outlook 13 Supply chain disruptions on account of COVID19 persist with implications for both food and nonfood prices A more favourable food inflation outlook may emerge as the bumper rabi harvest eases prices of cereals especially if open market sales and public distribution offtake are expanded on the back of significantly higher procurement The relatively moderate increases in minimum support prices MSP for the kharif crops and monsoon are also supportive of benign inflation prospects Nonetheless upside risks to food prices remain The abatement of price pressure in key vegetables is delayed and remains contingent upon normalisation of supplies Protein based food items could also emerge as a pressure point given the tight demandsupply balance in the case of pulses The inflation outlook of nonfood categories is however fraught with uncertainty Higher domestic taxes on petroleum products have resulted in elevated domestic pump prices and will impart broadbased costpush pressures going forward Volatility in financial markets and rising asset prices also pose upside risks to the outlook Taking into consideration all these factors headline inflation may remain elevated in Q2202021 but may moderate in H2202021 aided by large favourable base effects 14 Turning to the growth outlook the recovery in the rural economy is expected to be robust buoyed by the progress in kharif sowing Manufacturing firms responding to the Reserve Banks industrial outlook survey expect domestic demand to recover gradually from Q2 and to sustain through Q1202122 On the other hand consumer confidence turned more pessimistic in July relative to the preceding round of the Reserve Banks survey External demand is expected to remain anaemic under the weight of the global recession and contraction in global trade Taking into consideration the above factors real GDP growth in Q2Q4 is expected to evolve along the lines noted in the May resolution For the year 202021 as a whole real GDP growth is expected to be negative An early containment of the COVID19 pandemic may impart an upside to the outlook A more protracted spread of the pandemic deviations from the forecast of a normal monsoon and global financial market volatility are the key downside risks 15 The June release of headline inflation after a gap of two months and imputed prints of the CPI for AprilMay have added uncertainty to the inflation outlook The NSO has adopted best practices in producing these imputations for the purpose of business continuity in the face of challenges to data collection due to the nationwide lockdown The NSO has however not provided inflation rates for April and May For the purpose of monetary formulation and conduct therefore the MPC is of the view that CPI prints for April and May can be regarded as a break in the CPI series 16 The MPC noted that the economy is experiencing unprecedented stress in an austere global environment Extreme uncertainty characterises the outlook which is heavily contingent upon the intensity spread and duration of the pandemic particularly the heightened risks associated with a second wave of infections and the discovery of the vaccine In these conditions supporting the recovery of the economy assumes primacy in the conduct of monetary policy In pursuit of this objective the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID19 on the economy While space for further monetary policy action in support of this stance is available it is important to use it judiciously and opportunistically to maximise the beneficial effects for underlying economic activity 17 At the same time the MPC is conscious that its primary mandate is to achieve the mediumterm target for CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of 2 per cent It also recognises that the headline CPI prints of AprilMay 2020 require more clarity At the current juncture the inflation objective itself is further obscured by a the spike in food prices because of floods in eastern India and ongoing lockdown related disruptions and b costpush pressures in the form of high taxes on petroleum products hikes in telecom charges rising raw material costs reflected in upward revisions in steel prices and rise in gold prices on safe haven demand Given the uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook and taking into consideration the extremely weak state of the economy in the midst of an unprecedented shock from the ongoing pandemic it is prudent to pause and remain watchful of incoming data as to how the outlook unravels 18 Meanwhile the cumulative reduction of 250 basis points since February 2019 is working its way through the economy lowering interest rates in money bond and credit markets and narrowing down spreads Financing conditions have eased considerably enabling financial flows via financial markets especially at a time when banks remain highly risk averse Accordingly the MPC decides to stay on hold with regard to the policy rate and remain watchful for a durable reduction in inflation to use the available space to support the revival of the economy 19 All members of the MPC Dr Chetan Ghate Dr Pami Dua Dr Ravindra H Dholakia Dr Mridul K Saggar Dr Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das unanimously voted for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged and continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID19 on the economy while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward 20 The minutes of the MPCs meeting will be published by August 20 2020 Press Release 20202021149
https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=50176,Date Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies,This Statement sets out various developmental and regulatory policy measures to enhance liquidity support for financial markets and other stakeholders further easing of financial stress caused by COVID19 disruptions while strengthening credit discipline improve the flow of credit deepen digital payments augment customer safety in cheque payments and facilitate innovation across the financial sector by leveraging on technology through an Innovation Hub I Liquidity Management and Financial Markets 1 Additional Liquidity Facility for National Housing Bank Special refinance facilities for a total amount of 65000 crore were provided to all India financial institutions AIFIs the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development NABARD the Small Industries Development Bank of India SIDBI the National Housing Bank NHB and EXIM Bank in order to support their role in meeting funding requirements of various sectors In order to shield the housing sector from liquidity disruptions under the prevailing conditions and augment the flow of finance to the sector it has been decided to provide an additional standing liquidity facility ASLF of 5000 crore to NHB over and above 10000 crore already provided for supporting housing finance companies HFCs The facility will be for a period of one year and will be charged at the RBIs repo rate 2 Additional Liquidity Facility for NABARD Liquidity support of 25000 crore was extended to the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development NABARD in April 2020 to back agricultural operations in the wake of challenges posed by COVID19 and in view of the brightening prospects of the farm sector its capacity to provide employment in these trying times and its backward and forward linkages In order to ameliorate the stress being faced by smaller nonbank finance companies NBFCs and microfinance institutions in obtaining access to liquidity it has now been decided to provide an additional special liquidity facility ASLF of 5000 crore to NABARD for a period of one year at the RBIs policy repo rate for refinancing NBFCMFIs and other smaller NBFCs of asset size of 500 crore and less to support agriculture and allied activities and the rural nonfarm sector 3 Introduction of a Flexible Automated Option for Managing CRR Balances The Reserve Bank will introduce an optional facility to provide banks more flexibilitydiscretion to manage their day end cash reserve ratio CRR balances Using this facility in eKuber system banks will be able to set the amount specific or range that they wish to keep as balance in their current account with RBI at the end of the day Depending upon this preset amount marginal standing facility MSF and reverse repo bids as the case may be will be autogenerated at the end of the day Detailed guidelines are being issued separately II Regulation and Supervision Measures Aimed at Mitigating the Economic Fallout of COVID19 The regulatory focus over the past few months has been to frame appropriate policy responses to mitigate the immediate impact of COVID19 on the financial institutions and their constituents These measures were aimed at providing temporary reprieve to borrowers affected by the pandemic as well as address the liquidity needs of various segments of the financial system while maintaining its resilience RBI remains committed to take any further measures felt necessary in this direction while at the same time remaining fully committed to maintaining financial stability Going forward as the process for normalisation of economic activity gathers pace the need to address the deeper cash flowbalance sheet stress that many of the viable entities may have been exposed to on account of the pandemic and the consequent impact on the financial institutions is also recognised 4 Resolution Framework for COVID19related Stress The Prudential Framework on Resolution of Stressed Assets dated June 7 2019 provides a principlebased resolution framework for addressing borrower defaults under a normal scenario Any resolution plan implemented under the Prudential Framework which involves granting of any concessions on account of financial difficulty of the borrower entails an asset classification downgrade except when it is accompanied by a change in ownership which allows the asset classification to be retained or upgraded to Standard subject to the prescribed conditions The economic fallout on account of the COVID19 pandemic has led to significant financial stress for a number of borrowers across the board The resultant stress can potentially impact the longterm viability of a large number of firms otherwise having a good track record under the existing promoters due to their debt burden becoming disproportionate relative to their cash flow generation abilities Such wide spread impact could impair the entire recovery process posing significant financial stability risks Considering the above with the intent to facilitate revival of real sector activities and mitigate the impact on the ultimate borrowers it has been decided to provide a window under the Prudential Framework to enable the lenders to implement a resolution plan in respect of eligible corporate exposures without change in ownership and personal loans while classifying such exposures as Standard subject to specified conditions Such conditions are considered necessary to ensure that the facility of this resolution window is available only to the COVID19 related stressed assets Besides the crucial aspect of maintaining financial stability has also been suitably factored in In light of past experiences with regard to use of regulatory forbearances necessary safeguards are being incorporated including prudent entry norms clearly defined boundary conditions specific binding covenants independent validation and strict postimplementation performance monitoring Given the intent to facilitate revival of real sector activities and mitigate the impact on the ultimate borrowers the framework shall not be available for exposures to financial sector entities as well as Central and State Governments Local Government bodies eg Municipal Corporations and any body corporate established by an Act of Parliament or State Legislature The key features of the resolution framework for exposures other than personal loans are as under Only those borrower accounts shall be eligible for resolution under this framework which were classified as standard but not in default for more than 30 days with any lending institution as on March 1 2020 Further the accounts should continue to remain standard till the date of invocation All other accounts as hitherto may be considered for resolution under the June 7th Prudential Framework or the relevant instructions as applicable to specific category of lending institutions where the Prudential Framework is not applicable The resolution plan may be invoked anytime till December 31 2020 and shall have to be implemented within 180 days from the date of invocation Lenders shall have to keep additional provisions of 10 per cent on the postresolution debt In order to enforce collective action specific voting thresholds are being prescribed even for invocation of the resolution plan and those lending institutions not signing the intercreditor agreement ICA within 30 days from the date of invocation shall attract higher provisions of 20 Postimplementation the asset classification of the account shall be retained as standard or if the account had slipped into NPA after invocation but before implementation the asset classification shall be restored upon implementation The Reserve Bank is constituting an Expert Committee Chairman Shri KV Kamath which shall make recommendations to the RBI on the required financial parameters along with the sector specific benchmark ranges for such parameters to be factored into each resolution plans The final notification in this regard shall be issued by the Reserve Bank after considering the recommendations The Expert Committee shall also undertake a process validation of resolution plans for accounts above a specified threshold The lending institutions may allow extension of the residual tenor of the loan with or without payment moratorium by a period not more than two years Wherever the resolution plans involve conversion of a portion of debt into equity and other debt instruments the debt instruments with terms similar to the loan shall be counted as part of the postresolution debt whereas the portion converted into other nonequity instruments shall be fully written down In respect of accounts involving consortium or multiple banking arrangements all receipts by the borrower all repayments by the borrower to the lending institutions as well as all additional disbursements if any to the borrower by the lending institutions as part of the resolution plan shall be routed through an escrow account maintained with one of the lending institutions With respect to personal loans a separate framework is being prescribed The resolution plan for personal loans under this framework may be invoked till December 31 2020 and shall be implemented within 90 days thereafter The lending institutions are however encouraged to strive for early invocation in eligible cases The timelines for implementation of resolution plan in case of personal loans are assessed to be adequate since unlike larger corporate exposures there will not be any requirement for third party validation by the Expert Committee or by credit rating agencies or need for ICA The contours of the plan may be decided based on the Board approved policies of the lenders subject to extension of the residual tenor of the loan with or without payment moratorium by a period not more than two years Guidelines in this regard are being issued today 5 Restructuring of MSME debt With regard to MSMEs a restructuring framework is already in place for MSMEs that were in default but standard as on January 1 2020 subject to the restructuring being implemented upto December 31 2020 The scheme has provided relief to a large number of MSMEs However the stress in the MSME sector has got accentuated on account of the fallout of COVID19 Recognising the need for continued support to MSMEs meaningful restructuring it has been decided that in respect of MSME borrowers facing stress on account of the economic fallout of the pandemic lending institutions may restructure the debt under the existing framework provided the borrowers account was classified as standard with the lender as on March 1 2020 This restructuring shall be implemented by March 31 2021 Guidelines in this regard are being issued separately today 6 Advances against Gold Ornaments and Jewellery As per the extant guidelines loans sanctioned by banks against pledge of gold ornaments and jewellery for nonagricultural purposes should not exceed 75 per cent of the value of gold ornaments and jewellery With a view to further mitigate the economic impact of the COVID19 pandemic on households entrepreneurs and small businesses it has been decided to increase the permissible loan to value ratio LTV for loans against pledge of gold ornaments and jewellery for nonagricultural purposes from 75 per cent to 90 per cent This relaxation shall be available till March 31 2021 Guidelines in this regard are being issued today 7 Streamlining the Use of Multiple Operating Accounts by Large Borrowers While permitting the lending institutions to provide necessary relief to the borrowers through various measures it is also considered necessary to take appropriate measures for strengthening credit discipline Use of multiple operating accounts by borrowers both current accounts as well as cash credit CCoverdraft OD accounts has been observed to be prone to vitiating credit discipline The checks and balances put in place in the extant framework for opening of current accounts are found to be inadequate As such it has been decided to address the above concerns through appropriate safeguards for opening of current accounts and CCOD accounts for customers availing credit facilities from multiple banks Detailed instructions are being issued in this regard The above measures are also expected to bring in the requisite discipline in collective actions by the creditors for speedier resolution of stress in the accounts of borrowers which will be critical in implementation of the Resolution Framework for COVID19 related Stress as mentioned earlier 8 Investment by Banks in Debt Mutual Funds and Debt Exchange Traded funds Capital Charge for Market risk As per RBIs extant Basel III guidelines if a bank holds a debt instrument directly it would have to allocate lower capital as compared to holding the same debt instrument through a Mutual Fund MFExchange Traded Fund ETF This is because specific risk capital charge as applicable to equities is applied to investments in MFsETFs whereas if the bank was to hold the debt instrument directly specific risk capital charge is applied depending on the nature and rating of debt instrument It has therefore been decided to harmonise the differential treatment existing currently At the same time it is observed that a debt MFETF also has features akin to equity since in the event of default of even one of the debt securities in the MFETF basket there is often severe redemption pressure on the fund notwithstanding the fact that the other debt securities in the basket are of high quality Hence it has been decided that the general market risk charge of 9 per cent will continue to be applied Thus computation of total capital charge for market risk shall incorporate elements of both debt and equity instruments This will result in substantial capital savings for banks and is expected to give a boost to the bond market The circular in this regard is being issued separately III Financial Inclusion 9 Review of Priority Sector Lending Guidelines The Priority Sector Lending PSL guidelines issued by Reserve Bank of India were last reviewed in April 2015 With a view to align the guidelines with emerging national priorities and bring sharper focus on inclusive development the guidelines have been reviewed after wide ranging consultations with all stakeholders The revised guidelines also aim to encourage and support environment friendly lending policies to help achieve Sustainable Development Goals SDGs With a view to address the regional disparities in the flow of priority sector credit an incentive framework has been put in place for banks While higher weight will be assigned for incremental priority sector credit in the identified districts where credit flow is comparatively lower a lower weight would be assigned to incremental priority sector credit in identified districts where the credit flow is comparatively higher Other changes include broadening the scope of PSL to include startups increasing the limits for renewable energy including solar power and compressed bio gas plants and increasing the targets for lending to Small and Marginal Farmers and Weaker Sections Detailed guidelines in this regard will be issued shortly IV Payment and Settlement Systems 10 Scheme of Offline Retail Payments Using Cards and Mobile Devices There has been considerable growth in digital payments using mobile phones cards wallets etc Lack of internet connectivity or low speed of internet especially in remote areas is a major impediment in adoption of digital payments Against this backdrop providing an option of offline payments through cards wallets and mobile devices is expected to further the adoption of digital payments The Reserve Bank has been encouraging entities to develop offline payment solutions It is therefore proposed to allow a pilot scheme for small value payments in offline mode with builtin features for safeguarding interest of users liability protection etc The instructions in this regard will be issued shortly Based on experience gained detailed guidelines for rollout of the scheme will be announced in due course 11 Online Dispute Resolution ODR for Digital Payments As the number of digital transactions rise significantly there is a concomitant increase in the number of disputes and grievances Recourse to technologydriven redressal mechanisms that are rulebased transparent and involve minimum or no manual intervention is necessary to deal with them in a timely and effective manner Accordingly the Reserve Bank shall require Payment System Operators PSOs to introduce Online Dispute Resolution ODR Systems in a phased manner To begin with authorised PSOs shall be required to implement ODR systems for failed transactions in their respective Payment Systems Based on the experience gained ODR arrangements will be extended to other types of disputes and grievances Instructions in this regard will be issued today 12 Positive Pay Mechanism for Cheques The Cheque Truncation System CTS for clearing cheques is operational panIndia and presently covers 2 per cent and 15 per cent of total retail payments in terms of volume and value respectively the average value of a cheque cleared in CTS presently is 82000 The CTS2010 standard specifying minimumsecurity features on cheque leaves acts as a deterrent against cheque frauds while standardisation of field placements on cheque forms enables straightthroughprocessing by use of optical image character recognition technology To further augment customer safety in cheque payments and reduce instances of fraud occurring on account of tampering of cheque leaves it has been decided to introduce a mechanism of Positive Pay for all cheques of value 50000 and above Under this mechanism cheques will be processed for payment by the drawee bank based on information passed on by its customer at the time of issuance of cheque This measure will cover approximately 20 per cent and 80 per cent of total cheques issued in the country by volume and value respectively Operational guidelines for the purpose will be issued separately 13 Creation of Reserve Bank Innovation Hub The Reserve Bank has

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=49909,Date Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting May 20 to 22 2020,Under Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 The twenty third meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee MPC constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 was held from May 20 to 22 2020 the meeting was originally scheduled from June 3 to 5 2020 but was advanced to May 2022 in view of the ongoing COVID19 pandemic 2 The meeting was attended by all the members Dr Chetan Ghate Professor Indian Statistical Institute Dr Pami Dua former Director Delhi School of Economics Dr Ravindra H Dholakia former Professor Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad Dr Janak Raj Executive Director the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB2c of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 Dr Michael Debabrata Patra Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das Governor Dr Chetan Ghate Dr Pami Dua and Dr Ravindra H Dholakia joined the meeting through video conference 3 According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 the Reserve Bank shall publish on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following namely the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee ascribed to such member on the resolution adopted in the said meeting and the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under subsection 11 of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting 4 The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence households inflation expectations and the projections of professional forecasters The MPC also reviewed in detail staffs macroeconomic projections and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below Resolution 5 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation the Monetary Policy Committee MPC at its meeting today May 22 2020 decided to reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility LAF by 40 bps to 40 per cent from 440 per cent with immediate effect accordingly the marginal standing facility MSF rate and the Bank Rate stand reduced to 425 per cent from 465 per cent and the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands reduced to 335 per cent from 375 per cent The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID19 on the economy while ensuring that inflation remains within the target These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the mediumterm target for consumer price index CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of 2 per cent while supporting growth The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below Assessment Global Economy 6 Since the MPC met in March 2020 global economic activity has remained in standstill under COVID19 related lockdowns and social distancing Among the key advanced economies AEs economic activity contracted in the US Euro area Japan and the UK in Q12020 Among emerging market economies EMEs the Chinese economy went into a pronounced decline and data on high frequency indicators suggest that activity may have also shrunk in other EMEs such as Brazil and South Africa 7 Global financial markets calmed after a turbulent period in March and volatility ebbed as swift and large fiscal and monetary policy responses helped to soothe sentiment Equity markets recovered some lost ground while government bond yields remained rangebound although somewhat elevated in some EMEs due to country specific factors Portfolio flows to EMEs revived in April and the rush to safe havens eased With the US dollar weakening major EME currencies which had experienced persistent downward pressure traded with an appreciating bias Crude oil prices firmed up modestly as oil producing countries OPEC plus agreed to cut production and prospects for revival in demand improved on expectations of imminent easing of lockdowns Gold prices remained elevated on hedging demand CPI inflation remained subdued across major AEs and EMEs primarily due to a collapse in oil prices and compression in demand amidst lockdowns while food inflation picked up due to supply disruptions Domestic Economy 8 Domestic economic activity has been impacted severely by the lockdown which has extended over the past two months High frequency indicators point to a collapse in demand beginning March 2020 across both urban and rural segments Electricity consumption has plunged while both investment activity and private consumption suffered precipitous declines as reflected in the collapse in capital goods production and the large retrenchment in the output of consumer durables and nondurables in March High frequency indicators of service sector activity such as passenger and commercial vehicle sales domestic air passenger traffic and foreign tourist arrivals also experienced sizable contractions in March The only silver lining was provided by agriculture with the summer sowing of rice pulses and oilseeds in the country progressing well with total area sown under the current kharif season up by 435 per cent so far and the rabi harvest promising to be a bumper as reflected in record procurement 9 Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index moderated for the second consecutive month in March 2020 to 58 per cent after peaking in January This was mainly due to food inflation easing from double digits in December 2019 January 2020 In April however supply disruptions took a toll and reversed the softening of food inflation which surged to 86 per cent from 78 per cent in March Prices of vegetables cereals milk pulses and edible oils and sugar emerged as pressure points1 10 The Reserve Bank remained in proactive liquidity management mode expanding its array of measures both conventional and unconventional to augment systemlevel liquidity as also to channel liquidity to specific sectors facing funding constraints Systemic liquidity remained in abundance with average daily net absorptions under the liquidity adjustment facility LAF increasing to 566 lakh crore in May 2020 up to May 20 from 475 lakh crore in April During 202021 up to May 20 120474 crore was injected through open market operation OMO purchases and 87891 crore through three targeted longterm repo operation TLTRO auctions and one TLTRO 20 auction In order to distribute liquidity more evenly across the yield curve the Reserve Bank conducted one operation twist auction involving the simultaneous sale and purchase of government securities for 10000 crore each on April 27 2020 Furthermore the Reserve Bank has provided 22334 crore as refinance to National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development NABARD Small Industries Development Bank of India SIDBI and National Housing Bank NHB so far as on May 21 2020 and 2430 crore to mutual funds through a special liquidity facility SLF with a view to easing liquidity constraints and destress financial markets Since February 6 2020 the Reserve Bank has announced liquidity augmenting measures of 942 lakh crore 46 per cent of GDP 11 Reflecting the various liquidity management measures domestic financial conditions have eased appreciably as reflected in the narrowing of liquidity premia in various market segments Yields on government securities commercial paper CP 91day treasury bills certificates of deposit CDs and corporate bonds have softened The weighted average lending rates on fresh rupee loans of commercial banks declined by 43 bps in March 2020 alone Though credit growth remains muted scheduled commercial banks investments in commercial paper bonds debentures and shares of corporate bodies in this year so far up to May 8 increased sharply by 66757 crore as against a decline of 8822 crore during the same period last year There were net inflows into various schemes of mutual funds in April in contrast to large outflows in March 12 In the external sector Indias merchandise trade slumped in April 2020 with exports shrinking by 603 per cent and imports by 586 per cent yoy respectively While imports contracted in all 30 commodity groups in April exports contracted in 28 out of 30 groups The trade deficit narrowed in April 2020 both sequentially and on a yearonyear basis to its lowest level in 47 months On the financing side net foreign direct investment inflows picked up in March 2020 to US 29 billion from US 08 billion a year ago In 202021 so far till May 18 net foreign portfolio investment FPI in equities increased to US 12 billion from US 08 billion a year ago In the debt segment however there were portfolio outflows of US 38 billion during the same period as compared with outflows of US 14 billion a year ago By contrast net investment under the voluntary retention route increased by US 07 billion during the same period Indias foreign exchange reserves have increased by US 92 billion in 202021 so far up to May 15 to US 4870 billion equivalent to 12 months of imports Outlook 13 The inflation outlook is highly uncertain As supply lines get restored in the coming months with gradual relaxations in the lockdown the unusual spike in food inflation in April is expected to moderate The forecast of a normal monsoon also portends well for food inflation Given the current global demandsupply balance international crude oil prices are likely to remain low although they may firm up from the recent depressed levels Soft global prices of metals and other industrial raw materials are likely to keep input costs low for domestic firms Deficient demand may hold down pressures on core inflation excluding food and fuel although persisting supply dislocations impart uncertainty to the near term outlook However volatility in financial markets could have a bearing on inflation These factors combined with favourable base effects are expected to take effect and pull down headline inflation below target in Q3 and Q4 of 202021 14 Turning to the growth outlook economic activity other than agriculture is likely to remain depressed in Q1202021 in view of the extended lockdown Even though the lockdown may be lifted by endMay with some restrictions economic activity even in Q2 may remain subdued due to social distancing measures and the temporary shortage of labour Recovery in economic activity is expected to begin in Q3 and gain momentum in Q4 as supply lines are gradually restored to normalcy and demand gradually revives For the year as a whole there is still heightened uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic and how long social distancing measures are likely to remain in place and consequently downside risks to domestic growth remain significant On the other hand upside impulses could be unleashed if the pandemic is contained and social distancing measures are phased out faster 15 The MPC is of the view that the macroeconomic impact of the pandemic is turning out to be more severe than initially anticipated and various sectors of the economy are experiencing acute stress The impact of the shock has been compounded by the interaction of supply disruptions and demand compression Beyond the destruction of economic and financial activity livelihood and health are severely affected Even as various measures initiated by the Government and the Reserve Bank work to mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic on the economy it is necessary to ease financial conditions further This will facilitate the flow of funds at affordable rates and revive animal spirits With the inflation outlook remaining benign as lockdownrelated supply disruptions are mended the policy space to address growth concerns needs to be used now rather than later to support the economy even while maintaining headroom to back up the revival of activity when it takes hold 16 Accordingly all members voted for a reduction in the policy repo rate and maintaining the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID19 on the economy while ensuring that inflation remains within the target 17 Dr Pami Dua Dr Ravindra H Dholakia Dr Janak Raj Dr Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted for a reduction in the policy repo rate by 40 bps while Dr Chetan Ghate voted for a reduction by 25 bps 18 The minutes of the MPCs meeting will be published by June 5 2020 Statement by Dr Chetan Ghate 19 Since the last review the outlook for the economy has deteriorated further 20 Several high frequency indicators point to dire growth outcomes in the near term On COVID19 we havent achieved the first goal which is flattening of the curve The tug of war between economic and health costs has led to some opening up of the economy The economy needs to be opened up smartly The risk of prematurely opening the economy is that there could be a surge in new cases It takes time for local epidemics to grow The main growth challenge is that the top six industrialized states produce 62 of Indias GDP These are also the worst affected states by COVID 21 Despite the dire growth outcomes why have I voted for a 25 bps cut and not a larger amount 22 First it is not entirely clear to me that Covid19 constitutes a large disinflationary shock Inflationary pressures fall with economic slack the output gap but rise with expected future inflation and factors related to production costs 23 Both 3month ahead and 1year ahead inflationary expectations have spiked sharply by 190 bps and 120 bps respectively in the latest round of RBIs survey This spike reverses a relatively flat trajectory for inflationary expectations over the past six rounds of surveys It also reflects a sharp rise in food inflation in recent months In April food inflation rose to 86 from 78 in March and will likely remain elevated in the coming months This is worrisome I continue to be concerned about declining market arrivals of food commodities because of COVID related supply side bottlenecks and their inflationary impact 24 When the economy turns to the upside the recovery in demand will be swift There has already been a severe dislocation in domestic and global supply chains It will take some time to for these to get resolved and it is therefore likely that demand will recover faster than supply 25 Currently core inflation inflation excluding food and fuel continues to remain moderate with the April readings not released by the CSO likely to have been similar to the March readings or around 4 Lower oil prices have not been passed on to consumers at the pump because of a sharp hike in Central excise duties and increases in VAT rates on petrol and diesel across States cancelling out any beneficial effects of lower oil prices on core inflation 26 Second as I mentioned in the last review in a demand deficient economy a large rate cut is akin to pushing on a string 27 For rate cuts to work banks have to lend Despite the large number of steps taken to improve the liquidity and functioning of credit markets as of April 24 the most recent data available nonfood credit growth on a yoy basis was at 65 on May 8 2020 lower than 72 on April 10 2020 28 Third rate cuts should be seen as part other measures that have already been taken with respect to liquidity policy social insurance policy and fiscal policy in dealing with the crisis 29 Since the last review a comprehensive fiscal stimulus has been announced amounting to about 10 of GDP The Keynesian component of the stimulus ie the part that increases discretionary spending via fiscal policy is however around 1 of GDP 30 An ambitious Keynesian fiscal stimulus was always going to have to navigate between Scylla and Charybdis if the government spent too much on the discretionary part of the stimulus the yield curve would have gotten thrashed banks would have booked losses and our credit rating would have gotten a downgrade It would have also signalled that the government is giving up on its commitment to controlling inflation If it spent too little it risked a worsening of growth 31 To navigate the middle path the government has focussed on much needed structural reforms This is prudent The measured approach to the stimulus recognizes the government cannot spend its way to prosperity without implications for financial instability 32 Despite the small Keynesian component of the stimulus however taking into account the relaxation in state government borrowing limits the combined statecentre fiscal deficit is still likely to rise to around 1012 of GDP in FY 21 I doubt if the bond markets will shrug this off That means transmission to credit markets will suffer making a large rate cut pointless What compounds this is the rising risk aversion in the financial system will get exacerbated by a looming spike in NPAs because of the loan and mortgage holidays announced This will hinder transmission even more 33 Fourth since the last review a variety of high frequency indicators have declined sharply There has been a broad based and deep contraction in the March IIP Index of Industrial Production which fell to 167 from 46 in March Passenger vehicle sales have plummeted Consumer nondurables have fallen by 16 Indicators of fixed investment have tanked finished steel consumption has declined by 909 and IIP Capital goods which proxy for machinery and equipment have also fallen by 356 PMI manufacturing declined to 274 in April from 518 in March due to a sharp contraction in output and new export orders The services PMI dropped to 54 in April from 493 in March due to a sharp fall in business activity Exports have also fallen drastically by 603 34 While these have no doubt resulted in a large negative output gap it is also true that potential output has also fallen 35 The only silver lining is the agriculture sector The current Rabi crop has done well And the current summer sowing of crops for rice pulses coarse cereals and oilseeds is higher by 437 over last year 36 The strongest argument for a big rate cut would therefore be the dire growth outcomes because of COVID However such rate cuts should be saved for when the economy starts reviving and not when we are in a lockdown Rate cuts assuming that there is transmission and banks lend works most effectively when the economy is on the upside The MPC should keep some gunpowder dry 37 Fifth the reverse repo rate has been cut thrice in succession to 335 The idea behind the asymmetric cuts is to use the LAF corridor as an instrument of monetary policy For all practical purposes the reverse repo rate is now the effective policy rate I worry that the current quantum of liquidity will be difficult to unwind when things return back to normal RBIs liquidity policy has helped stabilize financial markets but lender of last resort policies as is widely recognised are not useful outside a crisis and thus should not be viewed as part of normal monetary policy 38 Given the above reasons I vote to cut the policy rate by 25 bps this time 39 I will continue to watch the incoming growthinflation data carefully and remain data dependent 40 I also vote to retain the stance as accommodative Statement by Dr Pami Dua 41 The nationwide lockdown over the past two months due to the COVID19 pandemic has severely impacted domestic economic activity yielding a grim prognosis for the economy This unprecedented and extraordinary economic and health crisis has also gravely affected the global economy with acute intensity and spread 42 On the domestic inflation front headline CPI inflation fell from 66 per cent in February 2020 to 58 per cent in March For the month of April only partial information has been released providing the numbers for food inflation which rose from 78 per cent in March to 86 per cent in April with prices of vegetables pulses edible oils milk and cereals being the prime drivers However low crude oil prices soft global prices of metals and other industrial raw materials and weakening aggregate demand are expected to soften inflation although supply disruptions may impact inflation adversely Overall headline inflation is expected to ease in the second half of FY202021 and fall below target This also conforms with the May 2020 round of the Inflation Expectations Survey of Households conducted by the Reserve Bank of India that shows higher inflation expectations for the threemonthsahead forecasts compared to forecasts for the oneyearahead horizon 43 On the domestic output front the evolving pandemic has had serious ramifications for domestic growth which is crippled by a nearstandstill in economic activity due to the lockdown and social distancing leading to demand compression as well as supply disruptions High frequency indicators of urban consumption demand passenger vehicle sales domestic passenger air traffic and consumer durables fell dramatically in March 2020 A similar dismal picture emerges in indicators of rural demand tractors sales motorcycle sales and consumer nondurables that plunged sharply in the same period Indicators of fixed investment also fell with a sharp drop in finished steel consumption in April and cement production in March reflecting a slowdown in construction activity Moreover capital goods production as per the usebased classification of IIP declined by 36 per cent in March along with a significant drop in capital goods imports during March and April While the data for the March print of IIP has been compiled with limited sample due to the institution of the lockdown from March 25 the preliminary data indicates a drop in IIP by almost 17 per cent with manufacturing falling by more than 20 per cent infrastructureconstruction goods by almost 24 per cent and electricity by 68 per cent 44 The Purchasing Managers Index PMI for manufacturing declined sharply to its lowest level of 274 in April from 518 in March partly due to contraction in output and new exports orders The PMI for services dropped dramatically to an unprecedented level of 54 in April from 493 in March due mainly to a drop in business activity new business orders and new export business High frequency indicators of the services sector in addition to those mentioned above passenger vehicle sales domestic passenger air traffic and including foreign tourist arrival railway freight traffic and commercial vehicle sales contracted in MarchApril 45 Fortunately growth in agriculture has held up with the total area under summer crops including rice pulses coarse cereals and oilseeds up by 437 per cent as on May 10 2020 over the corresponding period of last year Further as per the third advance estimates of crop production for 201920 production of foodgrains kharif and rabi in 201920 is 37 per cent higher than the final estimates of the previous year 46 The Consumer Confidence Survey conducted by RBI in May 2020 also paints a grim picture showing that the overall Current Situation Index is at a historic low while the Future Expectations Index reflects high pessimism for the year ahead Thus consumer sentiment has plunged to abysmally low levels 47 At the global level the global manufacturing PMI plunged to an eleven year low in April 2020 while the global services PMI sharply declined to a record low Accordingly Indias merchandise exports and imports witnessed record contractions with exports falling by 603 per cent in April 2020 while imports dropped by 586 per cent 48 The economic situation is thus extremely gloomy While the COVID19 pandemic is a humanitarian and health crisis the related lockdown has precipitated a collapse in economic activity which has come to a near standstill Other than in the agriculture sector economic activity may continue to remain sluggish even after the lifting of the lockdown due to social distancing and shortage of labour as a result of the migration of workers to their native places In fact GDP growth in FY202021 is expected to remain in negative territory with some respite in the second half of the fiscal year The way forward in terms of restoration of economic activity thus depends on the speed with which the pandemic is contained how quickly the Indian economy opens up and how soon supply disruptions are repaired and demand revives It will also depend on the impact of the combined stimulus from fiscal monetary social and administrative measures that have been implemented to create conditions conducive to survival in the crisis as well as for revival in growth Over time some reprioritisation in government expenditure towards health infrastructure and capital expenditure may also be desirable for promoting economic revival 49 The Government has outlined a comprehensive package in five tranches covering amongst other measures rural employment creation infrastructure creation focus on MSME sector and creation of an enabling business environment The package also includes relief measures for poorer sections of society and for resource constrained state governments by increasing their borrowing limits The measures also encompass a number of major structural reforms which are more longterm in nature 50 The Reserve Bank of India has used conventional monetary policy measures as well as unconventional monetary policy tools that supplement the conventional measures in order to ease financial conditions and stimulate growth in the economy It has also undertaken several measures to improve liquidity monetary transmission and credit flows to the economy and provide relief on debt servicing 51 Before the COVID19 pandemic hit the Indian economy the policy repo rate had already been reduced by 135 basis points between February and October 2019 in response to the slowdown in economic activity Since the advent of the pandemic the repo rate was further cut by 75 basis points in the March MPC meeting amounting to a total cut of 210 basis points between February 2019 and March 2020 The monetary policy transmission to lending rates of banks has improved with a 90 basis points decline in the oneyear median marginal cost of fundsbased lending rate MCLR between February 2019 and May 15 2020 The weighted average lending rate WALR on fresh rupee loans declined by 114 basis points between February 2019 and March 2020 with a fall of 43 basis points in March itself 52 Given the severity and depth of the crisis the macroeconomic impact of the pandemic is turning out to be more severe than initially anticipated Thus in order to revive growth and mitigate the economic impact of COVID19 it is important to ease financial conditions further Accordingly I vote for cutting the policy rate by 40 basis points This brings the total reduction in the policy rate since the start of the spread of the COVID19 pandemic to 115 basis points with the magnitude of cut in the easing cycle that started in February 2019 up to May 2020 being 250 basis points In the current scenario with heightened uncertainty and a nearstandstill in economic activity this may not necessarily lead to an immediate increase in borrowing but should raise consumer confidence and investor sentiment going forward I also vote to maintain the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth while ensuring that inflation remains within the target Statement by Dr Ravindra H Dholakia 53 Continuing lockdown in the geographical areas that contribute a major share in the Indian economy and worsening global economic situation due to COVID19 has now created a distinct possibility of the real GDP growth in India during 202021 to be in the negative zone for the first time in the last 40 years Even the nominal GDP growth may slip into the negative zone There are all symptoms of a recession fall in aggregate demand negative real growth and high unemployment The government has provided a major fiscal boost through a series of announcements The role of the monetary policy under such circumstances should be to supplement and support the fiscal efforts to bring the economy out of the unprecedented crisis Without exhausting all the space for policy rate cuts in this meeting I therefore vote for a 40 bps cut in the policy Repo Rate and maintaining the accommodative stance More specific reasons for my vote are as follows Under the lockdown measurement of consumer inflation and a survey of household inflationary expectations are likely to quite problematic The samples would be truncated and undesirable biases may enter the estimates making them unreliable and nonrepresentative Under such circumstances I feel the model based forecasts provide a better guide A very carefully carried out forecasting exercise provides an estimate of headline CPI inflation around 28 percent for Q4 202021 Even accounting for uncertainties a very conservative estimate may be taken as 3132 percent Thus inflation rising above the target of 4 percent does not seem to be any concern for the policy right now Although the real policy rate in most other comparator countries is zero or negative in India it is not only positive but relatively very high at around 12 to 16 percent I believe that the real policy rate needs to be kept positive but not so high under the present conditions The fiscal boost given by the Central government in several instalments is likely to result in further slippage of the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio of only 150 bps Similarly all states together may raise their fiscal deficit to GDP ratio by about 150 bps Thus the impact on the combined fiscal deficit to GDP ratio may be confined to about 300 bps which in my opinion is quite prudent under such extreme conditions It may not be inflationary and may result in growth recovery Once the situation returns back to normal and the fiscal and monetary boost measures start generating impacts the recovering economy in my opinion may require some further boost It is prudent to preserve some space for the future 54 Considering all these factors I vote for a 40 bps reduction in the policy repo rate and maintaining the accommodative stance Statement by Dr Janak Raj 55 The impact of COVID19 on economic activity has turned out to be much more acute than initially expected with the nationwide lockdown having been extended from initial 3 weeks to 9 weeks There is still uncertainty as to when the epidemiological curve will flatten and this will continue to cloud the macroeconomic outlook for some more time Be that as it may we are staring at a huge negative growth in the current quarter and overall negative growth for the year as a whole Both demand and supply sides of the economy have collapsed However I believe that supplies would recover much faster than demand This is because capacity to produce goods and services by and large remains intact though nonavailability of labour may temporarily hamper production for a few months On the other hand however there has been a substantial loss of demand A large number of daily labourerswage earners have been rendered jobless because of lockdown Though a part of the unemployed work force will get back to work still there are some sectors which have been hit hard and many people working in these sectors may have lost their jobs permanently This will adversely affect private consumption Otherwise also consumer confidence has been dented and consumers are likely to cut down on discretionary spending 56 Within aggregate demand while private consumption is likely to slowdown from the preCOVID19 levels what worries me more is investment demand which is likely to be impacted severely for a variety of reasons First given the collapse in demand excess capacity is likely to be created in many sectors This combined with huge uncertainty about future demand both domestic and external is likely to hamper new investments in the private sector Second financing of investment activity from own sources due to a decline in profitability or by borrowing due to weak balance sheets will also be a challenge Third the focus of government spending both by the Centre and the States will also be on revenue expenditure than on capital expenditure For all these reasons investment activity which contracted in last two quarters is expected to be severely hit going forward 57 Moving on to inflation the NSO has released data only on the food and housing groups for April 2020 Food inflation rose to 86 per cent in April from 78 per cent in March However these numbers need to be interpreted with a caution as the rise in food prices in April was caused by a disruption in supply lines and is transitory The wedge between CPI inflation and WPI inflation for food in April widened sharply by more than 500 bps While CPI food inflation increased by close to 80 bps in April WPI inflation declined by 190 bps from 55 per cent to 36 per cent suggesting an increase in margins at a retail level due to supply bottlenecks Should monsoon be normal as it has been forecast it should also have a salutary effect on food inflation I therefore feel that risks to food inflation other than in pulses are minimal at this stage and overall food inflation is expected to resume its downward trajectory from MayJune 58 Though the print of CPI fuel inflation was not available for April data from oil market companies suggest that domestic LPG and kerosene plunged in April in line with a decline in global prices 59 Finally we also do not have core inflation excluding food and fuel print for April The fall in international crude oil prices has not been passed on to domestic pump prices of petrol and diesel Though this makes domestic pump prices vulnerable to any rise in international prices on the current demand supply balance oil prices are likely to remain soft Given the collapse in domestic demand core inflation should soften significantly from the current levels over the medium term Input cost pressures are also likely to ease due to a sharp decline in global commodity prices Housing inflation at less than 4 per cent during MarchApril was the lowest in the series Gold prices are expected to remain firm due to a flight to safety On the whole however core inflation is expected to remain benign over the next few quarters Even though there is expected to be a V shaped recovery the economy will still be left with a considerable slack which will keep core inflation under check 60 To sum up economic activity is expected to contract in 202021 While supply lines are likely to be restored as lockdown is relaxed demand would take far longer to revive to preCOVID levels Even as some support will be provided by government expenditure overall consumption is likely to slow down due to a slump in private consumption More than private consumption however it is investment demand which is expected to be hit hard in this uncertain environment and may be a huge drag on economic activity in the near future with attendant implications for potential growth Therefore concerted efforts need to be made to revive investment demand Overall inflation over the medium term is expected to be benign Monetary policy has been eased significantly since February 2019 and the Government has also taken several measures which will help mitigate deleterious impact of COVID19 on aggregate demand However an unprecedented collapse in demand calls for further easing of financing conditions With the likely contraction in economic activity and the inflation outlook remaining soft the policy space has opened up I therefore vote for reducing the policy repo rate by 40 basis points and keeping the stance accommodative as long as it is necessary to revive growth while ensuring that inflation remains within the target Given the long transmission lags with which monetary policy operates it is important to create enabling financing conditions so that economic activity takes off swiftly as soon as normalcy is restored Should the inflation trajectory turn out as expected some more policy space may open up going forward For monetary policy actions to transmit fully to the credit market it is important that banks remain well capitalised Only banks with strong balance sheets could be expected to support lending activity as and when credit demand picks up Statement by Dr Michael Debabrata Patra 61 In my view the destruction of economic activity by COVID19 and ensuing lockdowns is much more deleterious in terms of loss of basic livelihood economic security health and confidence than the range of estimatesprojections of GDP and other macroeconomic aggregates suggest In India as in the rest of the world external trade investment manufacturing services involving people hospitality tourism aviation and construction and investment have been the worst hit Private consumption is tenuously holding on to positive territory but spending patterns have altered drastically away from the discretionary and to the essential The large monetary stimulus and fiscal effort are striving to put a floor under the aggregate demand At the current juncture the allout effort is to maintain and sustain with the hope that when life is secure resources energy and time can be marshalled to rebuild and revive 62 In fact my view is that the damage is so deep and extensive that Indias potential output has been pushed down and it will take years to repair 63 In the deliberations of the MPC my view is that the threats to growth have to be addressed frontally and aggressively or risk a more dire outlook 64 Meanwhile the prolonged lockdown has thrown supply into disarray and interrupted the easing of inflation that had gotten underway after the January 2020 peaking Contemporaneous information suggests that the momentum in the prices of several food items especially perishables may be ebbing with favourable implications for the evolution of headline inflation going forward This suggests that the food price spike has very little persistence and dispersion except in April 2020 when the lockdown started producing wider effects and can be looked through for policy purposes The sustained loss of momentum of seasonally adjusted GDP growth over eight consecutive quarters is depressing the underlying momentum of core inflation and this is likely to continue in the near term as aggregate demand would take time to return to preCOVID levels 65 Relative prices tend to adjust within the budget constraint For setting monetary policy however it is the absolute level of prices and its prospective movements that matter This warrants a careful assessment of aggregate demand Apart from the unidirectional loss of speed in real GDP growth monetary conditions are also reflecting the fragile state of demand While reserve money adjusted for the first round CRR effects is expanding substantially in relation to its pace a year ago this essentially reflects the large monetary stimulus and the publics flight to cash currency in circulation expanded yearonyear by 184 per cent up to May 22 2020 as against 149 per cent a year ago In the current milieu in which banks are depositing sizeable balances with the Reserve Bank rather than lendinginvesting the money multiplier at which this reserve money expansion translates into money supply has to be adjusted to include LAF reverse repos which are essentially remunerated excess reserves With this adjustment the money multiplier would have effectively declined from its normal level of 55 to about 45 This is showing up in the rate of money supply which has slowed below its secular trend in fact the negative money gap actual rate of money supply minus its trend rate has widened since 201920 especially from the second half Both bank credit and investments are decelerating to multiyear lows pointing to badly dented demand and risk aversion On the other hand bank deposits are growing faster than a year ago driven by a precautionary savings instinct in these times of heightened uncertainty It is important to break this recessionary loop shore up the erosion in confidence incentivise banks to invest and lend and people to spend 66 It is this context that should condition monetary policy actions and stance The MPC has decided to remain accommodative as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the fallout of COVID19 In keeping with this stance the policy rate has been reduced by 75 basis points since February 2020 when the virus outbreak assumed pandemic proportions In the evolving configuration of growth and inflation monetary policy can inspire confidence among households and businesses to break the vortex of public preference for deposits over spending and banks aversion to lend and invest Ahead of turning to mend broken areas of activity it is important to nurture the green shoots that have become visible as in agriculture and allied activities so that they take root and grow These considerations warrant backing up past actions and stance with another decisive reduction in the policy rate while persevering with the accommodative stance The experience of central banks has been that monetary policy acts best when it is reinforced by policy actions and stance in the same direction repetitively till the desired objectives are achieved 67 The size of the rate reduction needs to be calibrated to the space opened up by the inflation outlook after allowing for margins of error in these fluid and uncertain times while keeping in mind the ramifications of the size of the rate reduction for financial stability 68 Accordingly I vote for a reduction in the policy rate by 40 basis points while maintaining the accommodative stance of monetary policy that has been reflected in the resolutions of the MPC in the recent period Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das 69 The impact of COVID19 on the domestic economy has turned out to be far more severe than initially anticipated Lockdowns across major economies have also severely impacted economic activity across the globe In the April WEO the IMF projected the global economy to contract sharply by 30 per cent in 2020 GDP data for Q12020 and more recent high frequency indicators emanating from major advanced and emerging market economies however suggest that the contraction in global growth could be even deeper 70 Domestic economic activity has been impacted severely by two months of lockdown which was imposed to contain the spread of the COVID19 pandemic and save human lives High frequency indicators for MarchApril 2020 suggest a collapse of demand Industrial output measured by the index of industrial production IIP for March which included only seven days of the nationwide lockdown contracted by 167 per cent The contraction was spread across sectors with manufacturing shrinking by 206 per cent and capital goods production by 356 per cent Private consumption which has been the bedrock of domestic demand also plummeted with the production of consumer durables falling by 331 per cent in March 2020 and that of nondurables by 162 per cent 71 Limited data that are available for April suggest a further shrinkage in demand Indias merchandise trade slumped in April 2020 with exports contracting by 603 per cent and imports by 586 per cent While railway freight traffic shrank by 353 per cent in April steel consumption declined by 909 per cent PMI manufacturing and PMI services in April slipped to unprecedented levels of 274 and 54 respectively 72 Bank credit growth continues to be tepid suggesting weak demand Nonfood credit of scheduled commercial banks SCBs grew by 65 per cent yoy as on May 8 2020 as compared with 130 per cent a year ago During 202021 so far up to May 8 2020 however banks investment in commercial paper shares bonds and debentures increased by 66757 crore as against a decline of 8822 crore during the same period last year reflecting the impact of targeted long term repo operations TLTROs of the Reserve Bank 73 The only silver lining has been the agriculture sector the summer sowing is progressing well As on May 10 2020 summer sowing of all crops in the country was much higher by 437 per cent 379 per cent for rice 748 per cent for pulses and 293 per cent for oilseeds over last years acreage The harvest of rabi crop is almost complete The forecast of normal monsoon by the India Meteorological Department IMD augurs well for agriculture output and farm incomes 74 On inflation the headline consumer price index CPI for April 2020 was not available on account of nationwide lockdown Among the major groups for which indices were released food group inflation edged up in April 2020 to 86 per cent from 78 per cent in the previous month due to a broadbased increase in inflation across the food subgroups 75 The Reserve Bank has been proactively managing liquidity Since the MPC statement of February 6 2020 the Reserve Bank has announced liquidity augmenting measures of 942 lakh crore 46 per cent of GDP Monetary transmission has continued to improve with the weighted average lending rate WALR on fresh rupee loans declining by 43 bps in March the decrease since February 2019 when the current cycle of rate cut began being 114 bps 76 Looking ahead the growth outlook has deteriorated sharply There is still uncertainty as to when the COVID curve will flatten Even as the supply side is expected to ease gradually as the lockdown related restrictions are phased out it is the demand side which will continue to weigh heavily on economic activity for some time to come The impact of the fiscal and contingent liability measures announced by the government on demand creation needs to be carefully watched Quick implementation of various reform measures can also inject growth impulses into the Indian economy in the medium to long term Economic activity however is expected to contract in the first half of the year before recovering gradually in the second half of 202021 on the back of various fiscal monetary and liquidity measures undertaken in the recent period Overall the GDP growth in 202021 is estimated to remain in negative territory The pace of recovery will be contingent upon the containment of the pandemic and how quickly social distancinglockdown measures are phased out 77 It has become challenging to assess the inflation outlook in the absence of complete information on CPI Food inflation is expected to moderate in the coming months as transport impediments and supply lines get eased This is also corroborated by data on 22 essential commodities released by the Department of Consumer Affairs which show that prices of several food items have declined in this month so far from the April levels The meltdown in demand is also likely to result in a significant easing of price pressures in core goods and services Weak demand conditions in the presence of strong favourable base effects could result in headline inflation falling below the target rate during Q3 and Q4 of 202021 78 Since the last offcycle MPC meeting on March 27 2020 macrofinancial conditions have deteriorated rapidly The fast evolving tradeoffs between growth and inflation have underscored the need for intensifying the assessment of the macroeconomic outlook and the preparedness to act preemptively to address the swiftly shifting underlying economic and financial conditions and what they portend for the path going forward Delaying timely monetary policy response by two weeks waiting for the bimonthly MPC meeting schedule could be costly and irreversible In fact such a delay in monetary policy action could potentially become a source of risk itself to the deteriorating growth outlook Monetary policy is a rapid deployment instrument of public policy and monetary authorities forewarned by prescient assessment of the prevailing macroeconomic conditions have to be nimble It is in this context that the scheduled second bimonthly meeting of the MPC was advanced from June 3 to 5 2020 to May 20 to 22 2020 79 As pointed out in the foregoing paragraphs the risks to growth have become far more severe than in our assessment at the end of March 2020 It is expected that this diagnosis will be validated by hard data over the next few months even as the overall outlook continues to be highly uncertain The key challenge for monetary policy at this stage is to resuscitate domestic demand to avoid any harmful effect on income and employment in the short run and potential growth over the medium term For strengthening domestic demand it is important to revive consumer and business confidence The Government has already announced a variety of measures to provide economic support to various sectors of the economy and protect the interests of vulnerable sections of society The Reserve Bank has also been proactively managing liquidity to ensure that funds flow to all productive sectors of the economy RBI has also been easing monetary policy to reduce the cost of fundscapital to revive domestic demand While all these measures should help support demand as and when the nationwide lockdown is lifted but given the enormity of a collapse in demand the need is to move ahead full throttle to ease financing conditions further so as to revive consumption and revitalize investment Since banks are the key players in financing consumption and investment it is also imperative that they remain adequately capitalised The benign inflation outlook that is expected for the second half of 202021 coupled with the rising probability of a sharper loss of growth momentum in the nearterm has provided us with more policy space to ease financial conditions further and stimulate growth Since the outbreak of COVID19 the MPC has voted for frontloading its actions In view of the deteriorating outlook it is critical to reinforce these actions in sync with the space provided by the underlying conditions 80 In assessing the magnitude of policy space it is important to take into account the weak growth momentum the need for prioritising growth in view of the less risky inflation outlook and the need to assure benign financial conditions ahead of the recovery taking hold so that confidence is sustained Considering all these factors a reduction in the policy rate by 40 basis points would be appropriate Accordingly I vote for reducing the policy repo rate by 40 basis points from 44 per cent to 40 per cent I also vote for persevering with the accommodative stance of monetary policy The RBI remains watchful and shall not hesitate to use any conventional and unconventional tool in its toolkit to revive the macro economy and preserve financial stability while adhering to the inflation target Yogesh Dayal Chief General Manager Press Release 201920202459 1 All India headline CPI was not released for April 2020 in view of limited transactions in nonfood items due to the lockdown data were released only for the food and housing groups
https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=49844,Date Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies,This Statement sets out various developmental and regulatory policy measures to improve the functioning of markets and market participants measures to support exports and imports efforts to further ease financial stress caused by COVID19 disruptions by providing relief on debt servicing and improving access to working capital and steps to ease financial constraints faced by state governments I Measures to Improve the Functioning of Markets These measures are intended to ease constraints on market participants and channel liquidity to various sectors of the economy that are impacted by COVID19 related dislocations 1 Refinancing Facility for Small Industries Development Bank of India SIDBI The Small Industries Development Bank of India SIDBI plays an important role in meeting the longterm funding requirements of small industries In view of the tightening of financial conditions in the wake of the COVID19 pandemic and difficulties in raising resources from the market the RBI had announced a special refinance facility of 15000 crore to SIDBI for onlendingrefinancing Advances under this facility were provided at the RBIs policy repo rate at the time of availment for a period of 90 days In order to provide greater flexibility to SIDBI in its operations it has been decided to roll over the facility at the end of the 90th day for another period of 90 days 2 Investments by Foreign Portfolio Investors FPIs under the Voluntary Retention Route VRR The regulatory framework for FPI investment in debt has evolved over the years in line with the policy objective of encouraging such flows within the prevailing macroprudential framework The Voluntary Retention Route VRR introduced in March 2019 facilitates long term and stable FPI investment in debt and offers operational flexibility in terms of instrument choices and exemptions from certain regulatory requirements Since its introduction the VRR scheme has evinced strong investor participation with investments exceeding 90 per cent of the limits allotted under the scheme In view of difficulties expressed by FPIs and their custodians on account of COVID19 related disruptions in adhering to the condition that at least 75 per cent of allotted limits be invested within three months it has been decided that an additional three months will be allowed to FPIs to fulfil this requirement Detailed guidelines are being issued separately II Measures to Support Exports and Imports The deepening of the contraction in global activity and trade which has become accentuated by the outbreak of COVID19 and its rapid spread has crippled external demand In turn this has impacted Indias exports and imports both of which have contracted sharply in recent months In view of the importance of exports in earning foreign exchange and in providing income and employment and of imports in bringing in essential requirements of raw materials intermediates finished goods and technology measures are being taken to support the foreign trade sector 3 Export Credit Exporters have been facing genuine difficulties such as delay postponement of orders and delay in realisation of bills which are adversely affecting their production and realisation cycles It is in this context that the RBI permitted an increase in the period of realization and repatriation of export proceeds to India from nine months to 15 months from the date of export in respect of exports made up to or on July 31 2020 It has now been decided to increase the maximum permissible period of preshipment and postshipment export credit sanctioned by banks from the existing one year to 15 months for disbursements made up to July 31 2020 4 Liquidity Facility for Exim Bank of India The ExportImport Bank of India provides financial assistance to exporters and importers with a view to promoting the countrys international trade In view of the COVID19 pandemic however global trade has contracted sharply and global financial markets have turned highly volatile and risk averse especially to EMEs As Exim Bank predominantly relies on foreign currency resources raised from international financial markets for its operations it is facing challenges to raise funds in international debt capital markets Accordingly it has been decided to extend a line of credit of 15000 crore to the EXIM Bank for a period of 90 days from the date of availment with rollover up to a maximum period of one year so as to enable it to avail a US dollar swap facility to meet its foreign exchange requirements 5 Extension of Time for Payment for Imports COVID19 related disruptions to crossborder trade have imposed slowdown in manufacturingsale of finished products and delay in realisation of sale proceeds both domestically and overseas In turn this has elongated the operating cycle for business entities In this situation units find it difficult to pay for their imports within the time stipulated under the Foreign Exchange Management Act FEMA At present remittances for normal imports excluding import of golddiamonds and precious stonesjewellery into India are required to be completed within a period of six months from the date of shipment by the overseas supplier except in cases where amounts are withheld towards guarantee of performance It has been decided to extend the time period for completion of remittances against normal imports into India except in cases where amounts are withheld towards guarantee of performance from six months to twelve months from the date of shipment for such imports made on or before July 31 2020 The measure will provide greater flexibility to importers in managing their operating cycles in a COVID19 environment III Measures to Ease Financial Stress The intensification of COVID19 disruptions has imparted priority to relaxing repayment pressures and improving access to working capital by mitigating the burden of debt servicing prevent the transmission of financial stress to the real economy and ensure the continuity of viable businesses and households 6 Moratorium on Term Loan Instalments On March 27 2020 the RBI permitted all commercial banks including regional rural banks small finance banks and local area banks cooperative banks allIndia Financial Institutions and NBFCs including housing finance companies and microfinance institutions referred to hereafter as lending institutions to allow a moratorium of three months on payment of instalments in respect of all term loans outstanding as on March 1 2020 In view of the extension of the lockdown and continuing disruptions on account of COVID19 it has been decided to permit lending institutions to extend the moratorium on term loan instalments by another three months ie from June 1 2020 to August 31 2020 Accordingly the repayment schedule and all subsequent due dates as also the tenor for such loans may be shifted across the board by another three months 7 Deferment of Interest on Working Capital Facilities In respect of working capital facilities sanctioned in the form of cash creditoverdraft lending institutions are being permitted to allow a deferment of another three months from June 1 2020 to August 31 2020 in addition to the three months allowed on March 27 2020 on payment of interest in respect of all such facilities outstanding as on March 1 2020 8 Payment of Interest on Working Capital Facilities for the Deferment Period In order to ameliorate the difficulties faced by borrowers in repaying the accumulated interest for the deferment period on working capital facilities in one shot lending institutions are permitted to convert the accumulated interest on working capital facilities over the deferment period up to August 31 2020 into a funded interest term loan which shall be repayable not later than the end of the current financial year ie March 31 2021 Lending institutions may accordingly put in place a Board approved policy to implement the measures announced in para 6 7 8 9 Asset Classification i As the moratoriumdeferment is being provided specifically to enable borrowers to tide over COVID19 disruptions the same will not be treated as changes in terms and conditions of loan agreements due to financial difficulty of the borrowers and consequently will not result in asset classification downgrade ii As earlier the rescheduling of payments on account of the moratoriumdeferment will not qualify as a default for the purposes of supervisory reporting and reporting to credit information companies CICs by the lending institutions CICs shall ensure that the actions taken by lending institutions in pursuance of the announcements made today do not adversely impact the credit history of the borrowers iii In respect of all accounts for which lending institutions decide to grant moratoriumdeferment and which were standard as on March 1 2020 the 90day NPA norm shall also exclude the extended moratoriumdeferment period Consequently there would be an asset classification standstill for all such accounts during the moratoriumdeferment period from March 1 2020 to August 31 2020 Thereafter the normal ageing norms shall apply iv NBFCs which are required to comply with Indian Accounting Standards IndAS may follow the guidelines duly approved by their Boards and advisories of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ICAI in recognition of impairments Thus NBFCs have flexibility under the prescribed accounting standards to consider such relief to their borrowers 10 Easing of Working Capital Financing i In respect of working capital facilities sanctioned in the form of cash creditoverdraft lending institutions are permitted to recalculate the drawing power by reducing the margins till the extended period ie August 31 2020 In order to smoothen the impact for the borrowers lending institutions are permitted to restore the margins to the original levels by March 31 2021 ii Further lending institutions are permitted to reassess the working capital cycle of a borrowing entity up to an extended period till March 31 2021 This will provide necessary leeway to the lenders to make an informed assessment about the impact of the pandemic on the entity concerned iii Such changes in credit terms permitted to the borrowers to specifically tide over COVID19s fallout will not be treated as concessions granted due to financial difficulty of the borrower under Paragraph 2 of the Annex to the Reserve Bank of India Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets Directions 2019 dated June 7 2019 Prudential Framework and consequently will not result in asset classification downgrade 11 Extension of Resolution Timeline Under the Prudential Framework lending institutions are required to hold an additional provision of 20 per cent in the case of large accounts under default if a resolution plan has not been implemented within 210 days from the date of such default Given the continuing challenges to resolution of stressed assets lending institutions are permitted to exclude the entire moratoriumdeferment period from March 1 2020 to August 31 2020 from the calculation of 30day Review Period or 180day Resolution Period if the ReviewResolution Period had not expired as on March 1 2020 12 Limit on Group Exposures under the Large Exposures Framework Under the extant guidelines on the Large Exposures Framework the exposure of a bank to a group of connected counterparties shall not be higher than 25 percent of the banks eligible capital base at all times On account of the COVID19 pandemic debt markets and other capital market segments are witnessing heightened uncertainty As a result many corporates are finding it difficult to raise funds from the capital market and are predominantly dependent on funding from banks With a view to facilitating the flow of resources to corporates it has been decided as a onetime measure to increase a banks exposure to a group of connected counterparties from 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the eligible capital base of the bank The increased limit will be applicable up to June 30 2021 IV Debt Management 13 Consolidated Sinking Fund CSF of State Governments Relaxation of Guidelines State Governments maintain a Consolidated Sinking Fund CSF with the Reserve Bank as a buffer for repayment of their liabilities In the light of the Covid19 pandemic and the consequent stress on State Government finances the RBI has reviewed the Scheme and has decided to relax the rules governing withdrawal from the CSF while at the same time ensuring that depletion of the Fund balance is done prudently This will enable States to meet a larger proportion of their redemption of market borrowings falling due in the current financial year from the CSF These relaxations to states will release an additional amount of about 13300 crore Together with the normally permissible withdrawal this measure will enable the states to meet about 45 per cent of their redemptions due in 202021 through withdrawal from CSF This change in withdrawal norms will come into force with immediate effect and will remain valid till March 31 2021 In response to COVID19 the requirement of fiscal resources has increased with likely implications for market conditions going forward The RBI shall remain watchful and support the smooth completion of the borrowing programme of the Centre and States in the least disruptive manner Yogesh Dayal Chief General Manager Press Release 201920202392
https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=49843,Date Monetary Policy Statement 202021 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee MPC May 20 to 22 2020,On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation the Monetary Policy Committee MPC at its meeting today May 22 2020 decided to reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility LAF by 40 bps to 40 per cent from 440 per cent with immediate effect accordingly the marginal standing facility MSF rate and the Bank Rate stand reduced to 425 per cent from 465 per cent and the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands reduced to 335 per cent from 375 per cent The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID19 on the economy while ensuring that inflation remains within the target These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the mediumterm target for consumer price index CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of 2 per cent while supporting growth The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below Assessment Global Economy 2 Since the MPC met in March 2020 global economic activity has remained in standstill under COVID19 related lockdowns and social distancing Among the key advanced economies AEs economic activity contracted in the US Euro area Japan and the UK in Q12020 Among emerging market economies EMEs the Chinese economy went into a pronounced decline and data on high frequency indicators suggest that activity may have also shrunk in other EMEs such as Brazil and South Africa 3 Global financial markets calmed after a turbulent period in March and volatility ebbed as swift and large fiscal and monetary policy responses helped to soothe sentiment Equity markets recovered some lost ground while government bond yields remained rangebound although somewhat elevated in some EMEs due to countryspecific factors Portfolio flows to EMEs revived in April and the rush to safe havens eased With the US dollar weakening major EME currencies which had experienced persistent downward pressure traded with an appreciating bias Crude oil prices firmed up modestly as oil producing countries OPEC plus agreed to cut production and prospects for revival in demand improved on expectations of imminent easing of lockdowns Gold prices remained elevated on hedging demand CPI inflation remained subdued across major AEs and EMEs primarily due to a collapse in oil prices and compression in demand amidst lockdowns while food inflation picked up due to supply disruptions Domestic Economy 4 Domestic economic activity has been impacted severely by the lockdown which has extended over the past two months High frequency indicators point to a collapse in demand beginning March 2020 across both urban and rural segments Electricity consumption has plunged while both investment activity and private consumption suffered precipitous declines as reflected in the collapse in capital goods production and the large retrenchment in the output of consumer durables and nondurables in March High frequency indicators of service sector activity such as passenger and commercial vehicle sales domestic air passenger traffic and foreign tourist arrivals also experienced sizable contractions in March The only silver lining was provided by agriculture with the summer sowing of rice pulses and oilseeds in the country progressing well with total area sown under the current kharif season up by 435 per cent so far and the rabi harvest promising to be a bumper as reflected in record procurement 5 Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index moderated for the second consecutive month in March 2020 to 58 per cent after peaking in January This was mainly due to food inflation easing from double digits in December 2019 January 2020 In April however supply disruptions took a toll and reversed the softening of food inflation which surged to 86 per cent from 78 per cent in March Prices of vegetables cereals milk pulses and edible oils and sugar emerged as pressure points1 6 The Reserve Bank remained in proactive liquidity management mode expanding its array of measures both conventional and unconventional to augment systemlevel liquidity as also to channel liquidity to specific sectors facing funding constraints Systemic liquidity remained in abundance with average daily net absorptions under the liquidity adjustment facility LAF increasing to 566 lakh crore in May 2020 up to May 20 from 475 lakh crore in April During 202021 up to May 20 120474 crore was injected through open market operation OMO purchases and 87891 crore through three targeted longterm repo operation TLTRO auctions and one TLTRO 20 auction In order to distribute liquidity more evenly across the yield curve the Reserve Bank conducted one operation twist auction involving the simultaneous sale and purchase of government securities for 10000 crore each on April 27 2020 Furthermore the Reserve Bank has provided 22334 crore as refinance to National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development NABARD Small Industries Development Bank of India SIDBI and National Housing Bank NHB so far as on May 21 2020 and 2430 crore to mutual funds through a special liquidity facility SLF with a view to easing liquidity constraints and destress financial markets Since February 6 2020 the Reserve Bank has announced liquidity augmenting measures of 942 lakh crore 46 per cent of GDP 7 Reflecting the various liquidity management measures domestic financial conditions have eased appreciably as reflected in the narrowing of liquidity premia in various market segments Yields on government securities commercial paper CP 91day treasury bills certificates of deposit CDs and corporate bonds have softened The weighted average lending rates on fresh rupee loans of commercial banks declined by 43 bps in March 2020 alone Though credit growth remains muted scheduled commercial banks investments in commercial paper bonds debentures and shares of corporate bodies in this year so far up to May 8 increased sharply by 66757 crore as against a decline of 8822 crore during the same period last year There were net inflows into various schemes of mutual funds in April in contrast to large outflows in March 8 In the external sector Indias merchandise trade slumped in April 2020 with exports shrinking by 603 per cent and imports by 586 per cent yoy respectively While imports contracted in all 30 commodity groups in April exports contracted in 28 out of 30 groups The trade deficit narrowed in April 2020 both sequentially and on a yearonyear basis to its lowest level in 47 months On the financing side net foreign direct investment inflows picked up in March 2020 to US 29 billion from US 08 billion a year ago In 202021 so far till May 18 net foreign portfolio investment FPI in equities increased to US 12 billion from US 08 billion a year ago In the debt segment however there were portfolio outflows of US 38 billion during the same period as compared with outflows of US 14 billion a year ago By contrast net investment under the voluntary retention route increased by US 07 billion during the same period Indias foreign exchange reserves have increased by US 92 billion in 202021 so far up to May 15 to US 4870 billion equivalent to 12 months of imports Outlook 9 The inflation outlook is highly uncertain As supply lines get restored in the coming months with gradual relaxations in the lockdown the unusual spike in food inflation in April is expected to moderate The forecast of a normal monsoon also portends well for food inflation Given the current global demandsupply balance international crude oil prices are likely to remain low although they may firm up from the recent depressed levels Soft global prices of metals and other industrial raw materials are likely to keep input costs low for domestic firms Deficient demand may hold down pressures on core inflation excluding food and fuel although persisting supply dislocations impart uncertainty to the near term outlook However volatility in financial markets could have a bearing on inflation These factors combined with favourable base effects are expected to take effect and pull down headline inflation below target in Q3 and Q4 of 202021 10 Turning to the growth outlook economic activity other than agriculture is likely to remain depressed in Q1202021 in view of the extended lockdown Even though the lockdown may be lifted by endMay with some restrictions economic activity even in Q2 may remain subdued due to social distancing measures and the temporary shortage of labour Recovery in economic activity is expected to begin in Q3 and gain momentum in Q4 as supply lines are gradually restored to normalcy and demand gradually revives For the year as a whole there is still heightened uncertainty about the duration of the pandemic and how long social distancing measures are likely to remain in place and consequently downside risks to domestic growth remain significant On the other hand upside impulses could be unleashed if the pandemic is contained and social distancing measures are phased out faster 11 The MPC is of the view that the macroeconomic impact of the pandemic is turning out to be more severe than initially anticipated and various sectors of the economy are experiencing acute stress The impact of the shock has been compounded by the interaction of supply disruptions and demand compression Beyond the destruction of economic and financial activity livelihood and health are severely affected Even as various measures initiated by the Government and the Reserve Bank work to mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic on the economy it is necessary to ease financial conditions further This will facilitate the flow of funds at affordable rates and revive animal spirits With the inflation outlook remaining benign as lockdownrelated supply disruptions are mended the policy space to address growth concerns needs to be used now rather than later to support the economy even while maintaining headroom to back up the revival of activity when it takes hold 12 Accordingly all members voted for a reduction in the policy repo rate and maintaining the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID19 on the economy while ensuring that inflation remains within the target 13 Dr Pami Dua Dr Ravindra H Dholakia Dr Janak Raj Dr Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted for a reduction in the policy repo rate by 40 bps while Dr Chetan Ghate voted for a reduction by 25 bps 14 The minutes

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=49659,Date Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting March 24 26 and 27 2020,Under Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 The twenty second meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee MPC constituted under section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 was held during March 24 26 and 27 2020 at the Reserve Bank of India Mumbai the meeting was originally scheduled for March 31 April 1 and 3 2020 but was advanced in view of the COVID19 pandemic 2 The meeting was attended by all the members Dr Chetan Ghate Professor Indian Statistical Institute Dr Pami Dua former Director Delhi School of Economics Dr Ravindra H Dholakia former Professor Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad Dr Janak Raj Executive Director the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB2c of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 Dr Michael Debabrata Patra Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das Governor Dr Chetan Ghate Dr Pami Dua and Dr Ravindra H Dholakia joined the meeting through video conference 3 According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve

following namely the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee ascribed to such member on the resolution adopted in the said meeting and the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under subsection 11 of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting 4 The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence households inflation expectations corporate sector performance credit conditions the outlook for the industrial services and infrastructure sectors and the projections of professional forecasters The MPC also reviewed in detail staffs macroeconomic projections and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below Resolution 5 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation the Monetary Policy Committee MPC at its meeting today March 27 2020 decided to reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility LAF by 75 basis points to 440 per cent from 515 per cent with immediate effect accordingly the marginal standing facility MSF rate and the Bank Rate stand reduced to 465 per cent from 540 per cent further consequent upon the widening of the LAF corridor as detailed in the accompanying Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Polices the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands reduced by 90 basis points to 40 per cent The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of coronavirus COVID19 on the economy while ensuring that inflation remains within the target These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the mediumterm target for consumer price index CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of 2 per cent while supporting growth The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below Assessment Global Economy 6 Global economic activity has come to a near standstill as COVID19 related lockdowns and social distancing are imposed across a widening swathe of affected countries Expectations of a shallow recovery in 2020 from 2019s decade low in global growth have been dashed The outlook is now heavily contingent upon the intensity spread and duration of the pandemic There is a rising probability that large parts of the global economy will slip into recession 7 Financial markets have become highly volatile from January onwards due to the outbreak of COVID19 Panic selloffs have resulted in wealth destruction in equity markets across advanced and emerging economies alike In the former flight to safety has pulled down government bond yields to record lows with some hardening in recent days In the latter the rush to exit has rendered fixed income markets illiquid and resulted in firming up of yields Emerging and advanced economy currencies are experiencing severe depreciation pressure on a daily basis because of fire sales due to extreme risk aversion At this point only the US dollar remains safe haven in a highly uncertain outlook Japanese yen and gold the other two safe havens till the early part of March have given way to a flight to cash International crude prices initially traded with a softening bias from January in anticipation of demand weakening due to the COVID19 outbreak Production cut disagreements among key oil producers however set off retaliatory supply scaleups and a price war that plunged international Brent crude prices to a low of US 25 per barrel on March 18 2020 These developments are likely to dampen inflation across advanced and emerging economies Central banks and governments are in war mode responding to the situation with several conventional and unconventional measures targeted at easing financial conditions to avoid a demand collapse and to prevent financial markets from freezing up due to illiquidity Domestic Economy 8 The second advance estimates of the National Statistics Office released in February 2020 implied real GDP growth of 47 per cent for Q4201920 within the annual estimate of 5 per cent for the year as a whole This is now at risk from the pandemics impact on the economy High frequency indicators suggest that private final consumption expenditure has been hit hardest even as gross fixed capital formation has been in contraction since Q2201920 On the supply side the outlook for agriculture and allied activities appears to be the only silver lining with foodgrains output at 292 million tonnes being 24 per cent higher than a year ago A pickup in manufacturing and electricity generation pulled industrial production into positive territory in January 2020 after intermittent contraction andor lacklustre activity over the past five months however more data will need to be watched to assess whether the recent uptick will endure in the face of COVID19 Meanwhile most service sector indicators for January and February 2020 moderated or declined Since then anecdotal evidence suggests that several services such as trade tourism airlines the hospitality sector and construction have been further adversely impacted by the pandemic Dislocations in casual and contract labour would result in losses of activity in other sectors as well 9 Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index peaked in January 2020 and fell by a full percentage point in February 2020 to 66 per cent as the ebbing of onion prices brought down food inflation from double digits in the preceding two months Price pressures however remain firm across proteinrich items edible oils and pulses but the shock to demand from COVID19 may weaken them going forward While fuel inflation increased sharply in February on the back of the delayed domestic adjustment to international LPG prices the plunge in international crude prices in March may bring a measure of relief to the extent it is allowed to passthrough CPI inflation excluding food and fuel eased in February under the weight of softer prices of transport and communication and personal care Households inflation expectations a year ahead softened by 20 bps in the March 2020 round of the Reserve Banks survey 10 Domestic financial conditions have tightened considerably with equity markets facing massive selloffs by foreign portfolio investors FPIs In the bond market too yields have risen on sustained FPI selling while redemption pressures drop in trading activity and generalised risk aversion have pushed up yields to elevated levels in commercial paper corporate bond and other fixed income segments In the forex market the Indian rupee INR has been under continuous downward pressure Under these conditions the Reserve Bank has endeavoured to keep financial markets liquid stable and functioning normally Systemic liquidity surplus as reflected in net absorptions under the LAF averaged 286 lakh crore in March up to March 25 2020 In addition the Reserve Bank undertook unconventional operations in the form of auctions of what is called operation twist involving the simultaneous sale of shortterm government securities of 28276 crore and purchase of longterm securities of 40000 crore cumulatively injecting a net amount of 11724 crore The Reserve Bank also conducted five long term repo auctions of 1 year and 3 years tenors of a cumulative amount of 125 lakh crore so far to inject liquidity and improve monetary transmission It also conducted two sellbuy swap auctions to inject cumulatively US dollar liquidity into the forex market to the tune of US 271 billion on March 16 and 23 Open market purchase operations of 10000 crore on March 20 and 15000 crore each on March 24 and March 26 have been conducted to bolster liquidity and smoothen financial conditions 11 In the external sector merchandise exports expanded in February 2020 after posting six consecutive months of contraction Import growth also moved into positive territory after eight months of continuous decline Consequently the trade deficit widened marginally on a yearonyear basis although it was lower than its level a month ago On March 12 the Reserve Bank released balance of payments data which showed the current account having moved to near balance in Q3201920 with a deficit of only 02 per cent of GDP On the financing side net FDI inflows at US 378 billion during AprilJanuary 201920 were substantially higher than a year ago Portfolio investment recorded net outflows of US 52 billion during 201920 up to March 25 down from US 66 billion a year ago Indias foreign exchange reserves reached a level of US 4872 billion on March 6 2020 an increase of US 744 billion over their endMarch 2019 level Outlook 12 In the sixth bimonthly resolution of February 2020 CPI headline inflation was projected at 65 per cent for Q4201920 The prints for January and February 2020 indicate that actual outcomes for the quarter are running 30 bps above projections reflecting the onion price shock Looking ahead food prices may soften even further under the beneficial effects of the record foodgrains and horticulture production at least till the onset of the usual summer uptick Furthermore the collapse in crude prices should work towards easing both fuel and core inflation pressures depending on the level of the passthrough to retail prices As a consequence of COVID19 aggregate demand may weaken and ease core inflation further Heightened volatility in financial markets could also have a bearing on inflation 13 Turning to growth apart from the continuing resilience of agriculture and allied activities most other sectors of the economy will be adversely impacted by the pandemic depending upon its intensity spread and duration If COVID19 is prolonged and supply chain disruptions get accentuated the global slowdown could deepen with adverse implications for India The slump in international crude prices could however provide some relief in the form of terms of trade gains Downside risks to growth arise from the spread of COVID19 and prolonged lockdowns Upside growth impulses are expected to emanate from monetary fiscal and other policy measures and the early containment of COVID19 14 The MPC is of the view that macroeconomic risks both on the demand and supply sides brought on by the pandemic could be severe The need of the hour is to do whatever is necessary to shield the domestic economy from the pandemic Central banks across the world have responded with monetary and regulatory measures both conventional and unconventional Governments across the world have unleashed massive fiscal measures including targeted health services support to protect economic activity from the impact of the virus To mitigate the economic difficulties arising out of the virus outbreak the Government of India has announced a comprehensive package of 170 lakh crore covering cash transfers and food security for vulnerable sections of society including farmers migrant workers urban and rural poor differently abled persons and women The MPC notes that the Reserve Bank has taken several measures to inject substantial liquidity in the system Nonetheless the priority is to undertake strong and purposeful action in order to minimise the adverse macroeconomic impact of the pandemic It is in this context that the MPC unanimously votes for a sizable reduction in the policy repo rate but with some differences in the quantum of reduction Furthermore the MPC also notes that the Reserve Bank has decided to undertake several measures to further improve liquidity monetary transmission and credit flows to the economy and provide relief on debt servicing It also underscores the need for all stakeholders to fight against the pandemic Banks and other financial institutions should do all they can to keep credit flowing to economic agents facing financial stress on account of the isolation that the virus has imposed Market participants should work with regulators like the Reserve Bank and the Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI to ensure the orderly functioning of markets in their role of price discovery and financial intermediation Strong fiscal measures are critical to deal with the situation 15 All members voted for a reduction in the policy repo rate and maintaining the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID19 on the economy while ensuring that inflation remains within the target 16 Dr Ravindra H Dholakia Dr Janak Raj Dr Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted for a 75 bps reduction in the policy repo rate Dr Chetan Ghate and Dr Pami Dua voted for a 50 bps reduction in the policy repo rate 17 The minutes of the MPCs meeting will be published by April 13 2020 Statement by Dr Chetan Ghate 18 In the last review I had said While I dont see space for further cuts going forward I remain data dependent 19 In the last six weeks the data has turned in a significant way 20 Because of COVID19 acute downside risks to growth have mounted As lockdown measures kickin the economic cost of COVID19 could become large as production declines in various sectors and there is a permanent postponement of consumption expenditure plans 21 A large decline in global growth will also affect our exports adversely Growth in the service sector the largest sector in the economy will also be affected because discretionary spending will fall It is important to understand that consumer services retail hotels restaurants etc are a corollary of growth In contrast producer services finance IT Real Estate Transportation etc are producers of growth and also employment COVID19 will impact both slowing the momentum on the growth turnaround that had set in in the last few months 22 Unfortunately there is no shortcut at the current juncture apart from the lockdown 23 What should the monetary policy strategy be in this situation There are three considerations 24 First monetary policy should minimize the fall in aggregate demand ie we should minimize the extent of permanent damage done to growth by the COVID19 shock Hence the required cut in the policy rate should be large given the severity of the shock What is required is in the nature of an insurance cut 25 In a demand deficient economy a large rate cut however will be akin to pushing on a string I have been raising this concern in several previous policy reviews justifying the need for more structural reforms This concern prevents me from voting for an even larger cut in the policy rate this time 26 Second what is the appropriate division of labor between monetary policy liquidity policy social insurance policy and fiscal policy in stimulating aggregate demand 27 I see the current fiscal stimulus 17 lakh crore which is about 08 of GDP announced on March 26 2020 more in the nature or a relief measure social insurance rather than a stimulus A relief is not a permanent fix The idea of the measure announced by the government is to weather the storm so that no one has to go without food and spending on essential items The effect of this measure will be to lead to a small rise in consumption in the short run but the effect will dissipate quickly 28 On liquidity policy a large number of measures will be announced today which include prudential and forbearance measures A series of liquidity measures have already been enacted Forex swaps LTROs operation twist OMOs Combined these measures amount to a carpetbombing of the financial system with liquidity and will help flatten yields in those parts of the financial system where firesales have pushed up credit spreads The stabilization of financial markets will help improve economic outcomes 29 On fiscal policy I await details on a second stimulus package that will possibly be announced by the government The challenge will be this estimates of the size of the government spending multiplier internationally across a wide variety of studies unless the economy has a lot of slack or is stuck at the zero lower bound tend to be small and typically smaller than one an increase in Government spending by 100 Rs increases GDP by less than 100 Rs Tax multipliers on the other hand tend to be larger greater than one This suggests that the ideal fiscal stimulus to deal with COVID19 should be loaded on the tax side rather than the government spending side India however has limited tax penetration This is going to be the main design challenge 30 Finally what is the threat to our medium term inflation aim because of the COVID19 shock 31 While it is hard to assess in a precise manner the one year ahead level of inflation given the current situation new disinflationary forces have emerged since the last review namely an outsized reduction in crude because of geopolitical factors and a possible acute slowdown in growth in FY 2021 Inflation exfood and fuel could also fall with lower crude prices and with an opening up of the output gap 32 I worry though that even though vegetable inflation has fallen sharply from 50 in January 2020 it is still elevated at about 30 in February Unseasonal rains if any and COVID19 related lasting supply side disruptions in the food sector also pose an upside risk to the inflation trajectory in 202021 These need to be carefully watched 33 Taking monetary policy fiscal policy social insurance policy and liquidity policy together a 50 bps cut in the policy rate is appropriate at the current juncture 34 As noted recently by former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke in an AER article monetary policy has never proved able to reverse large shocks It only helps to mitigate the worse effects of shocks and speeds up the recovery 35 Once the COVID19 pandemic subsides is there likely to be a quick return to normal I am hopeful because production capacity has not been destroyed However I will watch the incoming growthinflation data carefully and remain data dependent 36 I also vote to retain the stance as accommodative Statement by Dr Pami Dua 37 The near nationwide lockdown due to the COVID19 outbreak has brought economic activity to almost a standstill The global economy has also been adversely impacted by the unprecedented economic and humanitarian crisis the severity of which will depend on the depth duration and diffusion of the evolving pandemic 38 Depending on the severity of the situation and the duration of the lockdown the crisis has ramifications for domestic growth stemming from supply side disruptions contraction in demand slowdown in global growth and a loss in consumer confidence as well as investor sentiment The supply chain of key industries is likely to be disrupted due to restricted access to imported raw materials The manufacturing sector is expected to drastically slow down due to closure of factories while consumer demand and investment spending are also likely to drop sharply The services sector is expected to be impacted the most due to restrictions on travel transport hospitality tourism and professional and financial services Construction activity is also expected to drop Trade is expected to take a hit due to a fall in domestic demand and contraction in global growth Since the shock to output is global it is unlikely that any country can act as an engine of growth to pull the world out of this situation 39 According to the second advance estimates of the NSO released in February 2020 GDP growth print for Q3 201920 was 47 and is expected to be 5 for the full FY 201920 However this may be difficult to achieve due to the negative impact of the coronavirus disease which gained momentum in February in the country 40 The slowdown in economic activity poses challenges for financial stability especially in the wake of recent development in one private sector bank Financial conditions have also become tight with massive selloffs by foreign portfolio investors in the debt and equity markets For the same reason the Indian rupee has also come under downward pressure However the Reserve Bank has done well to take various steps to inject large liquidity into the system and ensure stability in the financial markets 41 On the inflation front the trajectory of headline CPI inflation is heading downwards with easing of food prices in the light of record foodgrains and horticulture production The collapse in crude oil prices and weakening aggregate demand are expected to soften inflation further 42 Thus depending on the depth duration and diffusion of the crisis the risks to economic growth on both the supply and demand sides could be significant Fortunately in the current scenario inflation is expected to remain soft and does not pose as a major challenge The topmost priority therefore is to minimise the negative impact of the pandemic on economic growth This necessitates a multipronged approach comprising monetary fiscal and other policy measures as well as steps to contain the spread of COVID19 43 The Reserve Bank has already taken several measures to inject substantial liquidity into the system It is also widening the existing policy rate LAF corridor to incentivize banks to use funds for lending instead of parking them with RBI The Reserve Bank has also decided to undertake several measures to further improve liquidity monetary transmission and credit flows to the economy and provide relief on debt servicing The Government of India has also announced a comprehensive fiscal package covering cash transfers and food security for vulnerable sections of society Fiscal policy has a major role to play in combating the economic effects of the pandemic 44 Given the extraordinary crisis in order to revive growth and mitigate the economic impact of COVID19 a sizable reduction in the policy repo rate is clearly warranted Accordingly I vote for cutting the policy rate by 50 basis points In the current scenario with heightened uncertainty and a nearstandstill in economic activity this may not necessarily lead to an increase in borrowing but should raise consumer confidence and investor sentiment going forward It may be better to conserve some policy space for later when those binding constraints are removed and the economy will require a further boost to recover from the pandemic I also vote to maintain the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth Statement by Dr Ravindra H Dholakia 45 These are truly exceptional times Health hazards created by the spread of COVID19 all over the globe are pushing the world economy into unprecedented recession At the time of the previous meeting of MPC in early February 2020 the Indian economy was on the path of recovery from the growth slow down Nobody expected that COVID19 would hit India and so many other countries so soon and potentially so devastatingly that most of the production and economic activities would come to a grinding halt Prolonged lockdown has seriously adverse economic and social implications These external shocks are from both the supply and demand sides Both producers and consumers and hence investors and savers are losing confidence and even hope Under such unprecedented circumstances governments in all countries have come up with policy measures on both fiscal and monetary fronts to provide a substantial booster dose putting aside all other concerns like inflation and fiscal discipline In any case going forward CPI inflation in India four quarters ahead is most likely to be well below the targeted 4 per cent Therefore remaining within the mandate given by the Act this is the right time for MPC to act decisively and for RBI to provide a major booster dose to the economy basically to restore confidence of producers consumers investors and savers In my opinion there is enough space for a major rate cut and other liquidity and regulatory measures I therefore vote for a 75 bps cut to begin with in the policy repo rate and maintaining the accommodative stance More precise reasons for my vote are as follows The second advance estimate of GDP growth during 201920 by NSO published on 28th February 2020 has to be adjusted downwards because of the sudden adverse impact of COVID19 from March 2020 In my opinion the Q4201920 growth would be around 35 instead of 47 and hence the GDP growth for the year 201920 is likely to be around 47 instead of 5 as predicted by the NSO Although there are significant uncertainties about the impact of the Coronavirus based on various scenarios it is possible to have a conservative prediction range of GDP growth for the next year 202021 Accordingly I believe that GDP growth in the whole year 202021 would be less but not substantially less than the one observed during the current year and may be in the range of 4 to 45 The output gap would therefore continue to expand and exert downward pressure on the inflation exfood and fuel Looking to the international economic prospects in view of the devastating impact of COVID19 and the response of the oil producers the fuel prices are likely to remain depressed in the range of 2540 Even when we consider that the entire fall may not get transmitted to the domestic market the inflation in petroleum product prices may show a sharp declining trend over the next four quarters Rabi crop has been a bumper crop and assuming a normal monsoon next year food prices are expected to show a sharp declining trend over the next four quarters Thus headline CPI inflation by Q4202021 is expected to be only around 25 This makes the current real policy repo rate unduly high when the most of the comparator countries have cut their real policy rates to the zero or negative territory It is time to correct our real policy rates substantially Concerns about transmission of policy rate cuts are already addressed by the policy of external benchmarking of the lending rates by banks in respect of MSME retail and housing loans The Central Government has already started providing fiscal boost and may continue doing so to revive the economy 46 In my opinion MPC and RBI must complement the efforts by providing a major boost Fortunately both have enough space on policy rates and liquidity and regulatory forbearance aspects for such exceptional times unlike several Central Banks of the West This is the time for RBI to reduce the Reverse Repo Rate further by widening the corridor thereby discouraging banks to park their excess liquidity with RBI and encouraging them to get into the corporate bond market stop the clock for 34 months for recognition of defaults and downgrades to reduce panic and provide support reduce SLR substantially to overcome liquidity crunch for credit expansion and such other measures In order to provide a major boost through MPC I vote to cut the policy Repo Rate by 75 bps this time There is still enough space for the policy rate cut as and when required to support growth recovery going forward since inflation is likely to be under control Statement by Dr Janak Raj 47 In recent weeks there has been a drastic change in the global and domestic macroeconomic scenarios Coronavirus COVID19 has crippled global supply chains and disrupted economic activity in many countries The outbreak of coronavirus initially began as a supply shock but it soon also became a demand shock with restrictions on travel tourism and cut back in nonessential spending due to lockdowns Reflecting the severe impact that the COVID19 is expected to have on the global economy financial markets have been witnessing turbulence 48 The authorities in many countries including central banks have unleashed conventional and unconventional measures to mitigate the adverse macroeconomic impact of the pandemic Despite massive easing by central banks however global financing conditions have tightened due to a flight to safety That there has been so much flight for safety and demand for liquidity that there has been large selling even in gold pulling down its prices which normally rise in an uncertain environment 49 Since the pandemic is still spreading and its impact deepening the estimates for downward drag on global growth are continuously being revised However it is now clear that global growth in 2020 is likely to be much weaker than that in 2019 As the COVID19 pandemic has impacted advanced and emerging economies alike due to lockdowns and impaired supply chains there is in fact a serious risk that the global economy will even slip into recession in 2020 In the face of slowing down of global growth huge global debt accumulated after the global financial crisis may also pose serious threats to global financial stability 50 Moving on to the domestic economy economic activity appeared to have picked up some pace as reflected in several indicators in JanuaryFebruary such as growth in IIP including manufacturing railways freight traffic tractor sales and credit to micro and small industries Both exports and imports also turned positive in February PMI manufacturing in January and PMI composite in February were at eightyear high However these past data have become less relevant as the nearterm outlook has turned highly uncertain caused by COVID19 the spread strength and length of which are unknown at this stage 51 Various segments of the financial market have become extremely volatile and trading volumes have declined pushing yields across the spectrum of yield curve The domestic equity market has plummeted in the face of massive selloffs by foreign portfolio investors On the whole domestic financial conditions have tightened and could seriously undermine monetary transmission which otherwise improved in the more recent period 52 While initially it was the civil aviation hospitality and entertainment sectors which were hit by COVID19 now with a 21day nationwide lockdown most sectors will take a hit in Q4 201920 and Q1202021 The number of infected cases is relatively still low in India And with the nationwide lockdown if the spread is contained life could slowly start returning to normalcy and the economy could also start recovering gradually However growth for the year as a whole is likely to be weak for three reasons First discretionary spending by households is likely to be curtailed in general even though there could be some pentup demand in some sectors Second external demand will remain weak impacting our exports Third weak domestic and external demand is likely to cause a delay in revival of investment activity However the increased government spending may cushion the slowdown 53 Inflation declined by 100 bps in February pulled down by vegetables especially onion However with a lockdown there may be some nearterm pressure on prices in many food items Beyond nearterm food inflation is expected to moderate on arrival of the bumper rabi harvest Fuel group inflation is likely to decline significantly with a large fall in global LPG prices CPI inflation ex food and fuel is expected to remain soft on account of two factors i a slowdown in demand and ii a sharp decline in international crude oil prices which will not only have a direct impact on petroleum product prices but also on input prices in many industries However the decline in domestic pump and LPG prices will occur only to the extent the passthrough takes place On the whole the inflation outlook appears to have become benign Collection of comprehensive CPI data during the period of lockdown would be challenging which may therefore hamper a clearer assessment of the price situation for immediate months 54 On the whole it has been hard to clearly assess the macroeconomic outlook at this point of time The COVID19 pandemic has led to a series of a priori indistinguishable shocks a sharp slowdown in global demand volatility in financial markets a sharp fall in crude oil prices and virtual freeze of global trade and travel All these factors have generated unforeseen volatility in several macroeconomic and financial variables identification of which for modelling purposes is practically impossible Furthermore assigning probabilities on outcomes in times of infrequent but highimpact events such as the COVID19 pandemic for projection purposes is extremely daunting 55 To sum up there is an unprecedented uncertainty about the exact impact COVID19 will have on the nearterm growth outlook Though difficult to quantify it is clear that aggregate demand will weaken significantly in the near future which will impact the growth prospects for the year as a whole Therefore the main challenge for monetary policy at this juncture is to ensure that the adverse impact of COVID19 on domestic demand is not amplified It is also necessary to make sure that financial markets which have been under stress with yields hardening across the maturity spectrum do not intensify macroeconomic risks by impairing monetary transmission and giving rise to financial stability risks Beyond the immediate future and once the situation starts normalising domestic demand would need to be stimulated without any loss of time The inflation outlook has improved significantly Keeping in view these considerations the need of the hour is to effect a sizeable reduction in the policy rate I therefore vote for reducing the policy repo rate by 75 basis points The reduction in the policy rate together with several other liquidity enhancing measures being separately announced by the Reserve Bank should ease financing conditions and address financial stability risks I also vote for persevering with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth and to mitigate the adverse impact of COVID19 while ensuring that inflation remains within the target Statement by Dr Michael Debabrata Patra 56 The corona viruss danse macabre is taking a catastrophic toll on human lives Economic dislocation is severe and markets are in turmoil Affected nations have taken wideranging health services support stabilisation and regulatory measures to ease the conduct of financial and economic activity and try to alleviate the destruction wrought by the pandemic Global growth projections are being slashed and the world economy appears to be staring at a deep recession but the full effects of the losses incurred are still unknown especially as expectations that the virus outbreak would be contained in the first quarter of 2020 have been belied 57 India has locked down and a state of siege prevails Several types of activity have come to a standstill with social isolation supply disruptions demand contraction and heightened anxiety The outlook for the economy is highly uncertain and shifts with every incoming data on the impact of the virus Prospects for the Indian economy now hinge around how pervasive and severe COVID19 turns out to be and how long it lasts 58 In these challenging circumstances monetary policy has to assume an avant garde role Even as it fights the corrosive impact of COVID19 on macroeconomic and financial conditions monetary policy has to provide confidence and assuage fear This involves easing financing conditions for people and institutions keeping finance flowing to all agents in the economy ensuring that markets do not freeze up providing the assurance that the Reserve Bank of India is at the forefront in the war against COVID19 and will use all instruments at its command to fight the virus and mitigate its fall out It is important however to emphasise that COVID19 is a global crisis and warrants action beyond the remit of monetary policy within the country and across the world 59 In my minutes in February 2020 I had stated that the coronavirus outbreak has imparted new and uncertain risks in response to which the world is grappling to fashion a credible response My sense at that time was that the MPC has entered a tunnel of testing tradeoffs TTT and it may be a while before the light at the end of the tunnel is sighted Today as that prognosis materialises with disturbing intensity I believe that the MPC is being called upon to rise beyond its mandate The MPC must show the way with the powerful decision that it wields By doing so it will leverage and catalyse the Reserve Bank into the battlefront role that has to be undertaken for the greater common good It is in this context that the rate decision of the MPC has to be significant enough to reach various troubled sectors and ease their financing constraints decisively as well as transmit positive announcement effects across the economy to dispel gloom and instil confidence 60 Accordingly I vote for a reduction in the policy rate and for maintaining an accommodative policy stance for as long as necessary to fight COVID19 and revive growth What should be the size of the reduction Inflation has peaked and will likely ease well below the target in the second half of 202021 In the extreme scenario in which we are however the easing off of inflation may occur sooner and faster In terms of the primary mandate given to the MPC this outlook offers the scope for taking a calculated risk on current levels of inflation which rule above the target and focus on the 12 months ahead forecast By this rule there is space for policy action that is large in size relative to its past but still keeps the policy rate positive in real terms over a one year ahead horizon so as to see off any lingering or latent inflationary pressures Meanwhile the output gap is widening and may become pronouncedly negative as the situation evolves In order to address these macroeconomic challenges ease financial conditions substantially and infuse confidence I vote for a cut in the policy rate of 75 basis points COVID19 is a global danger our defence must be collective and coordinated even with social distancing All stakeholders must muster inner strength and determination to stay the course and fight the scourge Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das 61 The global macroeconomic situation has abruptly worsened in the last fortnight or so and the authorities and central banks in many countries have deployed an extensive range of targeted policy instruments to deal with the macroeconomic fallout of COVID19 caused by lockdowns and social distancing The outbreak of COVID19 has seriously dented global growth prospects Across the world activity has come to a near standstill There is a rising probability of a global recession which may be deeper than the one experienced during the global financial crisis 62 In India also the nearterm growth outlook has deteriorated sharply initially reflecting global spillovers and the amplification of the impact of COVID19 and thereafter due to the much needed efforts mounted by the Government to contain the pandemic by declaring a nationwide lockdown of 21 days up to April 14 2020 Prior to the outbreak some high frequency indicators such as manufacturing railway freight traffic exports and imports in JanuaryFebruary had improved after several months of contractiondeceleration With COVID19 however industry and service sector activities are likely to be severely impacted and the extent of the adverse impact would depend upon the intensity spread and duration of COVID19 The only silver lining is likely to be agriculture which is expected to remain resilient with foodgrains production for 201920 estimated second advance estimates or SAE at a record 292 million tonnes 38 per cent higher than the SAE for 201819 The setback to economic activity could be cushioned to an extent by the collapse in crude oil prices but there could be certain downsides in the form of decline in remittances from oil producing countries 63 On the inflation front the outlook has changed drastically The inflation print for February 2020 softened by 100 basis points to 66 per cent from 76 per cent in January Going forward inflation outcomes are likely to be shaped significantly by COVID19 and the sharp fall in oil prices Food prices may also soften further on the back of record foodgrains and horticulture production The usual uptick that begins in summer months may remain subdued if demand conditions take longer to normalise The weakening of domestic aggregate demand may also help to contain core inflation 64 The Reserve Bank has been proactively managing liquidity in the system Overall liquidity in the system continued to remain in large surplus at close to 30 lakh crore on an average per day in February and March 2020 so far With a view to facilitating monetary transmission the Reserve Bank conducted five long term repo operations LTRO between February 17 and March 18 2020 for oneyear and threeyear tenors aggregating 125 lakh crore In order to ease financial conditions which had tightened due to a sharp drop in trading volumes and consequent illiquidity the Reserve Bank has taken several measures to inject further substantial liquidity in the system such as i conducting two 6month US sellbuy swap auctions on March 16 and March 23 2020 cumulatively injecting dollar liquidity of US 271 billion ii injecting 40000 crore through three open market operation OMO purchase auctions on March 20 24 and 26 2020 iii injecting 77745 crore through two finetuning variable rate 16day repos on March 23 and 24 2020 and iv injecting 11772 crore through one finetuning variable rate repo auction of 12days maturity on March 26 65 The COVID19 pandemic is an invisible assassin which needs to be contained quickly before it spreads and wreaks havoc on valuable human lives and the macro economy In this scenario it is important to ensure that finance which is the lifeline of the economy keeps flowing seamlessly to various sectors of the economy It is comforting that the macroeconomic fundamentals of the Indian economy continue to be sound especially in comparison with the conditions that prevailed in the aftermath of the global financial crisis 66 We are living through an extraordinary time and the situation currently facing the country is unprecedented It therefore becomes imperative to make allout efforts to protect the domestic economy from the adverse impact of the pandemic The Government has announced several measures to protect the vulnerable sections of society The Reserve Bank is undertaking measures almost on a daily basis to provide relief and financial accommodation to various segments of the economy The path to normalisation of activity however is contingent on how Indias COVID19 epidemiological curve evolves amidst heightened uncertainty Growth impulses face strong headwinds from sluggish aggregate demand and disruptions in supply of labour and key inputs including imports The erosion of consumer confidence and investment sentiment can operate in an adverse feedback loop to worsen the growth outlook even further In this emerging scenario monetary policy needs to proactively arrest any deterioration in aggregate demand and thereby create enabling conditions for businesses to normalise production and supply chains as and when the situation becomes conducive for resumption of economic activity The space for policy action has opened up in view of the disinflationary effects of deceleration in demand under the impact of COVID19 Weaker overall demand outlook and lower crude oil prices should keep upside risks to inflation firmly contained even in the face of temporary supply chain disruptions and scope for opportunistic use of pricing power Arresting risks to the growth outlook and preserving financial stability should accordingly receive the highest priority Considering all these aspects I vote for reducing the policy repo rate by a sizable 75 basis points and maintaining the accommodative stance as long as necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID19 on the economy while ensuring that inflation remains within the target The substantial rate cut along with several other regulatory and liquidity augmenting measures being announced as a part of developmental and regulatory policies today convey the resolve of the Reserve Bank to deal with the macroeconomic fallout of COVID19 preemptively The Reserve Bank will continue to remain vigilant and will not hesitate to use any instrument conventional and unconventional to mitigate the impact of COVID19 revive growth and preserve financial stability Yogesh Dayal Chief General Manager Press Release 201920202207

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=49582,Date Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies,This Statement sets out various developmental and regulatory policies that directly address the stress in financial conditions caused by COVID19 They consist of i expanding liquidity in the system sizeably to ensure that financial markets and institutions are able to function normally in the face of COVIDrelated dislocations ii reinforcing monetary transmission so that bank credit flows on easier terms are sustained to those who have been affected by the pandemic iii easing financial stress caused by COVID19 disruptions by relaxing repayment pressures and improving access to working capital and iv improving the functioning of markets in view of the high volatility experienced with the onset and spread of the pandemic The policy initiatives in this section should be read in conjunction with the MPCs decision on monetary policy actions and stance in its resolution I Liquidity Management As stated earlier the first set of measures is intended to ensure that adequate liquidity is available to all constituents so that COVID19 related liquidity constraints are eased 1 Targeted Long Term Repos Operations TLTROs The onset and rapid propagation of COVID19 in India has ignited large selloffs in the domestic equity bond and forex markets With the intensification of redemption pressures liquidity premia on instruments such as corporate bonds commercial paper and debentures have surged Combined with the thinning of trading activity with the COVID outbreak financial conditions for these instruments which are used inter alia to access working capital in the face of the slowdown in bank credit have also tightened In order to mitigate their adverse effects on economic activity leading to pressures on cash flows it has been decided that the Reserve Bank will conduct auctions of targeted term repos of up to three years tenor of appropriate sizes for a total amount of up to 100000 crore at a floating rate linked to the policy repo rate Liquidity availed under the scheme by banks has to be deployed in investment grade corporate bonds commercial paper and nonconvertible debentures over and above the outstanding level of their investments in these bonds as on March 27 2020 Banks shall be required to acquire up to fifty per cent of their incremental holdings of eligible instruments from primary market issuances and the remaining fifty per cent from the secondary market including from mutual funds and nonbanking finance companies Investments made by banks under this facility will be classified as held to maturity HTM even in excess of 25 per cent of total investment permitted to be included in the HTM portfolio Exposures under this facility will also not be reckoned under the large exposure framework The first TLTRO auction will be held today March 27 2020 Following a review of the outcome of this auction the subsequent TLTRO auctions will be announced Details about this facility are being issued separately 2 Cash Reserve Ratio a Liquidity in the banking system remains ample as reflected in absorption of surpluses from the banking system under reverse repo operations of the LAF of the order of 286 lakh crore on a daily average basis during March 125 2020 It is observed however that the distribution of this liquidity is highly asymmetrical across the financial system and starkly so within the banking system As a onetime measure to help banks tide over the disruption caused by COVID19 it has been decided to reduce the cash reserve ratio CRR of all banks by 100 basis points to 30 per cent of net demand and time liabilities NDTL with effect from the reporting fortnight beginning March 28 2020 This reduction in the CRR would release primary liquidity of about 137000 crore uniformly across the banking system in proportion to liabilities of constituents rather than in relation to holdings of excess SLR This dispensation will be available for a period of one year ending on March 26 2021 b Furthermore taking cognisance of hardships faced by banks in terms of social distancing of staff and consequent strains on reporting requirements it has been decided to reduce the requirement of minimum daily CRR balance maintenance from 90 per cent to 80 per cent effective from the first day of the reporting fortnight beginning March 28 2020 This is a onetime dispensation available up to June 26 2020 3 Marginal Standing Facility Under the marginal standing facility MSF banks can borrow overnight at their discretion by dipping up to 2 per cent into the Statutory Liquidity Ratio SLR In view of the exceptionally high volatility in domestic financial markets which bring in phases of liquidity stress and to provide comfort to the banking system it has been decided to increase the limit of 2 per cent to 3 per cent with immediate effect This measure will be applicable up to June 30 2020 This is intended to provide comfort to the banking system by allowing it to avail an additional 137000 crore of liquidity under the LAF window in times of stress at the reduced MSF rate announced in the MPCs resolution These three measures relating to TLTRO CRR and MSF will inject a total liquidity of 374 lakh crore to the system 4 Widening of the Monetary Policy Rate Corridor In view of persistent excess liquidity it has been decided to widen the existing policy rate corridor from 50 bps to 65 bps Under the new corridor the reverse repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility LAF would be 40 bps lower than the policy repo rate The marginal standing facility MSF rate would continue to be 25 bps above the policy repo rate II Regulation and Supervision Alongside liquidity measures it is important that efforts are undertaken to mitigate the burden of debt servicing brought about by disruptions on account of the fallout of the COVID19 pandemic Such efforts in turn will prevent the transmission of financial stress to the real economy and will ensure the continuity of viable businesses and provide relief to borrowers in these extraordinarily troubled times 5 Moratorium on Term Loans All commercial banks including regional rural banks small finance banks and local area banks cooperative banks allIndia Financial Institutions and NBFCs including housing finance companies and microfinance institutions lending institutions are being permitted to allow a moratorium of three months on payment of instalments in respect of all term loans outstanding as on March 1 2020 Accordingly the repayment schedule and all subsequent due dates as also the tenor for such loans may be shifted across the board by three months 6 Deferment of Interest on Working Capital Facilities In respect of working capital facilities sanctioned in the form of cash creditoverdraft lending institutions are being permitted to allow a deferment of three months on payment of interest in respect of all such facilities outstanding as on March 1 2020 The accumulated interest for the period will be paid after the expiry of the deferment period In respect of paragraphs 5 and 6 above the moratoriumdeferment is being provided specifically to enable the borrowers to tide over the economic fallout from COVID19 Hence the same will not be treated as change in terms and conditions of loan agreements due to financial difficulty of the borrowers and consequently will not result in asset classification downgrade The lending institutions may accordingly put in place a Board approved policy in this regard 7 Easing of Working Capital Financing In respect of working capital facilities sanctioned in the form of cash creditoverdraft lending institutions may recalculate drawing power by reducing margins andor by reassessing the working capital cycle for the borrowers Such changes in credit terms permitted to the borrowers to specifically tide over the economic fallout from COVID19 will not be treated as concessions granted due to financial difficulties of the borrower and consequently will not result in asset classification downgrade In respect of paragraphs 5 6 and 7 the rescheduling of payments will not qualify as a default for the purposes of supervisory reporting and reporting to credit information companies CICs by the lending institutions CICs shall ensure that the actions taken by lending institutions pursuant to the above announcements do not adversely impact the credit history of the beneficiaries 8 Deferment of Implementation of Net Stable Funding Ratio NSFR As part of reforms undertaken in the years following the global financial crisis the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision BCBS had introduced the Net Stable Funding Ratio NSFR which reduces funding risk by requiring banks to fund their activities with sufficiently stable sources of funding over a time horizon of a year in order to mitigate the risk of future funding stress As per the prescribed timeline banks in India were required to maintain NSFR of 100 per cent from April 1 2020 It has now been decided to defer the implementation of NSFR by six months from April 1 2020 to October 1 2020 9 Deferment of Last Tranche of Capital Conservation Buffer The capital conservation buffer CCB is designed to ensure that banks build up capital buffers during normal times ie outside periods of stress which can be drawn down as losses are incurred during a stressed period As per Basel standards the CCB was to be implemented in tranches of 0625 per cent and the transition to full CCB of 25 per cent was set to be completed by March 31 2019 It was subsequently decided to defer the implementation of the last tranche of 0625 per cent of the CCB from March 31 2019 to March 31 2020 Considering the potential stress on account of COVID19 it has been decided to further defer the implementation of the last tranche of 0625 per cent of the CCB from March 31 2020 to September 30 2020 Consequently the prespecified trigger for loss absorption through conversionwritedown of Additional Tier 1 instruments PNCPS and PDI shall remain at 55 per cent of riskweighted assets RWAs and will rise to 6125 per cent of RWAs on September 30 2020 III Financial Markets The decision in respect of financial markets is essentially of a developmental nature intended to improve depth and price discovery in the forex market segments by reducing arbitrage between onshore and offshore markets This measure assumes greater importance in the context of the increased volatility of the rupee caused

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=49581,Date Seventh Bimonthly Monetary Policy Statement 201920 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee MPC Reserve Bank of India,On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation the Monetary Policy Committee MPC at its meeting today March 27 2020 decided to reduce the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility LAF by 75 basis points to 440 per cent from 515 per cent with immediate effect accordingly the marginal standing facility MSF rate and the Bank Rate stand reduced to 465 per cent from 540 per cent further consequent upon the widening of the LAF corridor as detailed in the accompanying Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Polices the reverse repo rate under the LAF stands reduced by 90 basis points to 40 per cent The MPC also decided to continue with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of coronavirus COVID19 on the economy while ensuring that inflation remains within the target These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the mediumterm target for consumer price index CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of 2 per cent while supporting growth The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below Assessment Global Economy 2 Global economic activity has come to a near standstill as COVID19 related lockdowns and social distancing are imposed across a widening swathe of affected countries Expectations of a shallow recovery in 2020 from 2019s decade low in global growth have been dashed The outlook is now heavily contingent upon the intensity spread and duration of the pandemic There is a rising probability that large parts of the global economy will slip into recession 3 Financial markets have become highly volatile from January onwards due to the outbreak of COVID19 Panic selloffs have resulted in wealth destruction in equity markets across advanced and emerging economies alike In the former flight to safety has pulled down government bond yields to record lows with some hardening in recent days In the latter the rush to exit has rendered fixed income markets illiquid and resulted in firming up of yields Emerging and advanced economy currencies are experiencing severe depreciation pressure on a daily basis because of fire sales due to extreme risk aversion At this point only the US dollar remains safe haven in a highly uncertain outlook Japanese yen and gold the other two safe havens till the early part of March have given way to a flight to cash International crude prices initially traded with a softening bias from January in anticipation of demand weakening due to the COVID19 outbreak Production cut disagreements among key oil producers however set off retaliatory supply scaleups and a price war that plunged international Brent crude prices to a low of US 25 per barrel on March 18 2020 These developments are likely to dampen inflation across advanced and emerging economies Central banks and governments are in war mode responding to the situation with several conventional and unconventional measures targeted at easing financial conditions to avoid a demand collapse and to prevent financial markets from freezing up due to illiquidity Domestic Economy 4 The second advance estimates of the National Statistics Office released in February 2020 implied real GDP growth of 47 per cent for Q4201920 within the annual estimate of 5 per cent for the year as a whole This is now at risk from the pandemics impact on the economy High frequency indicators suggest that private final consumption expenditure has been hit hardest even as gross fixed capital formation has been in contraction since Q2201920 On the supply side the outlook for agriculture and allied activities appears to be the only silver lining with foodgrains output at 292 million tonnes being 24 per cent higher than a year ago A pickup in manufacturing and electricity generation pulled industrial production into positive territory in January 2020 after intermittent contraction andor lacklustre activity over the past five months however more data will need to be watched to assess whether the recent uptick will endure in the face of COVID19 Meanwhile most service sector indicators for January and February 2020 moderated or declined Since then anecdotal evidence suggests that several services such as trade tourism airlines the hospitality sector and construction have been further adversely impacted by the pandemic Dislocations in casual and contract labour would result in losses of activity in other sectors as well 5 Retail inflation measured by the consumer price index peaked in January 2020 and fell by a full percentage point in February 2020 to 66 per cent as the ebbing of onion prices brought down food inflation from double digits in the preceding two months Price pressures however remain firm across proteinrich items edible oils and pulses but the shock to demand from COVID19 may weaken them going forward While fuel inflation increased sharply in February on the back of the delayed domestic adjustment to international LPG prices the plunge in international crude prices in March may bring a measure of relief to the extent it is allowed to passthrough CPI inflation excluding food and fuel eased in February under the weight of softer prices of transport and communication and personal care Households inflation expectations a year ahead softened by 20 bps in the March 2020 round of the Reserve Banks survey 6 Domestic financial conditions have tightened considerably with equity markets facing massive selloffs by foreign portfolio investors FPIs In the bond market too yields have risen on sustained FPI selling while redemption pressures drop in trading activity and generalised risk aversion have pushed up yields to elevated levels in commercial paper corporate bond and other fixed income segments In the forex market the Indian rupee INR has been under continuous downward pressure Under these conditions the Reserve Bank has endeavoured to keep financial markets liquid stable and functioning normally Systemic liquidity surplus as reflected in net absorptions under the LAF averaged 286 lakh crore in March up to March 25 2020 In addition the Reserve Bank undertook unconventional operations in the form of auctions of what is called operation twist involving the simultaneous sale of shortterm government securities of 28276 crore and purchase of longterm securities of 40000 crore cumulatively injecting a net amount of 11724 crore The Reserve Bank also conducted five long term repo auctions of 1 year and 3 years tenors of a cumulative amount of 125 lakh crore so far to inject liquidity and improve monetary transmission It also conducted two sellbuy swap auctions to inject cumulatively US dollar liquidity into the forex market to the tune of US 271 billion on March 16 and 23 Open market purchase operations of 10000 crore on March 20 and 15000 crore each on March 24 and March 26 have been conducted to bolster liquidity and smoothen financial conditions 7 In the external sector merchandise exports expanded in February 2020 after posting six consecutive months of contraction Import growth also moved into positive territory after eight months of continuous decline Consequently the trade deficit widened marginally on a yearonyear basis although it was lower than its level a month ago On March 12 the Reserve Bank released balance of payments data which showed the current account having moved to near balance in Q3201920 with a deficit of only 02 per cent of GDP On the financing side net FDI inflows at US 378 billion during AprilJanuary 201920 were substantially higher than a year ago Portfolio investment recorded net outflows of US 52 billion during 201920 up to March 25 down from US 66 billion a year ago Indias foreign exchange reserves reached a level of US 4872 billion on March 6 2020 an increase of US 744 billion over their endMarch 2019 level Outlook 8 In the sixth bimonthly resolution of February 2020 CPI headline inflation was projected at 65 per cent for Q4201920 The prints for January and February 2020 indicate that actual outcomes for the quarter are running 30 bps above projections reflecting the onion price shock Looking ahead food prices may soften even further under the beneficial effects of the record foodgrains and horticulture production at least till the onset of the usual summer uptick Furthermore the collapse in crude prices should work towards easing both fuel and core inflation pressures depending on the level of the passthrough to retail prices As a consequence of COVID19 aggregate demand may weaken and ease core inflation further Heightened volatility in financial markets could also have a bearing on inflation 9 Turning to growth apart from the continuing resilience of agriculture and allied activities most other sectors of the economy will be adversely impacted by the pandemic depending upon its intensity spread and duration If COVID19 is prolonged and supply chain disruptions get accentuated the global slowdown could deepen with adverse implications for India The slump in international crude prices could however provide some relief in the form of terms of trade gains Downside risks to growth arise from the spread of COVID19 and prolonged lockdowns Upside growth impulses are expected to emanate from monetary fiscal and other policy measures and the early containment of COVID19 10 The MPC is of the view that macroeconomic risks both on the demand and supply sides brought on by the pandemic could be severe The need of the hour is to do whatever is necessary to shield the domestic economy from the pandemic Central banks across the world have responded with monetary and regulatory measures both conventional and unconventional Governments across the world have unleashed massive fiscal measures including targeted health services support to protect economic activity from the impact of the virus To mitigate the economic difficulties arising out of the virus outbreak the Government of India has announced a comprehensive package of 170 lakh crore covering cash transfers and food security for vulnerable sections of society including farmers migrant workers urban and rural poor differently abled persons and women The MPC notes that the Reserve Bank has taken several measures to inject substantial liquidity in the system Nonetheless the priority is to undertake strong and purposeful action in order to minimise the adverse macroeconomic impact of the pandemic It is in this context that the MPC unanimously votes for a sizable reduction in the policy repo rate but with some differences in the quantum of reduction Furthermore the MPC also notes that the Reserve Bank has decided to undertake several measures to further improve liquidity monetary transmission and credit flows to the economy and provide relief on debt servicing It also underscores the need for all stakeholders to fight against the pandemic Banks and other financial institutions should do all they can to keep credit flowing to economic agents facing financial stress on account of the isolation that the virus has imposed Market participants should work with regulators like the Reserve Bank and the Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI to ensure the orderly functioning of markets in their role of price discovery and financial intermediation Strong fiscal measures are critical to deal with the situation 11 All members voted for a reduction in the policy repo rate and maintaining the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID19 on the economy while ensuring that inflation remains within the target 12 Dr Ravindra H Dholakia Dr Janak Raj Dr Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted for a 75 bps reduction in the policy repo rate Dr Chetan Ghate and Dr Pami Dua voted for a 50 bps reduction in the policy repo rate 13 The minutes of the MPCs

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=137,FAQs on Resolution Framework for Covid19 related stress Revised on December 12 2020 Updated as on August 19 2022,1 In Paragraph 4 of the Annex to the Resolution Framework it is stated that the reference date for the outstanding amount of debt that may be considered for resolution shall be March 1 2020 Does this mean that only debt outstanding as on March 1 2020 can be resolved under the Resolution Framework The stipulation at Paragraph 4 of the Annex to the Resolution Framework is a general clause regarding the date on which the eligibility criteria for resolution under the Resolution Framework may be assessed The specific application of the reference date with respect to deciding the eligibility of accounts for resolution under Part A and Part B of the Annex to the Resolution Framework have been separately specified in Paragraphs 6 and 13 respectively ie the requirement that the borrowers should be classified as standard but not in default for more than 30 days with any lending institution as on March 1 2020 The actual debt that may be considered for resolution will be the outstanding as on the date of invocation 2 Are all the farm credit as listed in Paragraph 61 of Master Direction FIDDCOPlan1040901201617 dated July 7 2016 as updated ineligible under the Resolution Framework Are the JLG loans provided to farmer households by MFIs are eligible for resolution plan under the Resolution Framework All the farm credit exposures of all lending institutions including NBFCs of the nature listed in Paragraph 61 of Master Direction FIDDCOPlan1040901201617 dated July 7 2016 as updated except for loans to allied activities viz dairy fishery animal husbandry poultry beekeeping and sericulture are excluded from the scope of the Resolution Framework Subject to the above loans given to farmer households would be eligible for resolution under the Resolution Framework if they do not meet any other conditions for exclusions listed in the Resolution Framework 3 In real estate sector and other sectors where a company typically may have multiple projects financed through multiple instruments can the ICA escrow account and the financial parameters including the prescribed thresholds be made applicable at the project level rather than the legal entity to which the lending institutions may have exposure The requirement of ICA in respect of the entity to which lending institutions have exposure is a basic feature of Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets dated June 7 2019 and consequently that of the Resolution Framework There is sufficient flexibility to the lending institutions to formulate ICAs in respect of a legal entity to which they have exposure that address the specific requirements of each borrowers on a case to case basis including designing different resolution approaches for different projects under the same borrower within an ICA Similarly apart from the escrow account required to be set up at the legal entity level as required by the Resolution Framework there is no prohibition in setting up additional separate escrow accounts at each project level if the lenders desire so Only in respect of borrowers belonging to real estate sector and have both residential and commercial real estate business the prescribed thresholds for the financial parameters may be applied at the project level 4 The Resolution Framework states that the accounts that do not fulfill the eligibility conditions may continue to be considered under the prudential framework applicable to the specific category of institutions Does it mean that alternative resolution frameworks available to a specific category of financial institutions such as Paragraph 21zcii of the Master Circular The Housing Finance companies NHB Directions 2010 for housing finance companies and Paragraph 22721 of the Master Circular Income Recognition Asset Classification Provisioning and Other Related Matters UCBs dated July 1 2015 for Urban Cooperative Banks would continue to be applicable for nonCovid impacted borrowers For the borrowers eligible for resolution under the circular dated August 6 2020 on Resolution Framework for COVID19related Stress the circular dated August 6 2020 will be applicable if a resolution process under the circular is invoked For all other borrowers the extant instructions as otherwise applicable shall still be in force However if any entity is otherwise eligible to be resolved under the Resolution Framework only Resolution Framework can be used for resolving the stress arising out of the pandemic 5 Are microfinance loans to individuals including JLG borrowers eligible for resolution under the Resolution Framework Similarly whether Loans sanctioned to Self Help Groups SHGs engaged in nonfarm activities are eligible to the benefit under the Resolution Framework All loans meeting the eligibility criteria unless covered by the specific exclusions listed in Paragraph 2 of the Annex to the Resolution Framework subject to the clarification at Sl No 2 above fall within the scope of resolution under the framework These loans if not falling under any of the categories mentioned in Paragraph 2 of the Annex to the Resolution Framework is eligible for resolution under Part A of the Annex if they fall within the purview of personal loans as defined in the Circular DBRNoBPBC990813100201718 dated January 4 2018 on XBRL Returns Harmonization of Banking Statistics even if they are not explicitly classified as so in any regulatory supervisory reporting or under Part B of the Annex otherwise 6 In Paragraph 8 of the Annex to the Resolution Plan it is stated that resolution under this framework may be invoked not later than December 31 2020 and must be implemented within 90 days from the date of invocation What are the meanings of the terms invocation and implementation in this context The definitions of invocation and implementation in respect of eligible personal loans have been given in Paragraphs 7 and 10 respectively of the Annex to the Resolution Framework In respect of other eligible loans invocation shall be as per Paragraphs 14 and 15 of the Annex to the Resolution Framework whereas implementation shall have the meaning as per Paragraphs 1416 of the circular dated June 7 2019 on Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets 7 Is the Resolution Framework applicable to all exposures including investment exposures that are credit substitutes like corporate bonds commercial papers etc The Resolution Framework may be invoked for resolution of all exposures of lending institutions to eligible borrowers including investment exposures However the Resolution Framework is without prejudice to all applicable guidelines issued by the relevant financial sector regulators and other Departments of the RBI in respect of any particular exposure 8 Are the various additional provisions prescribed in the Resolution Framework applicable to NBFCs who are following IndAS NBFCs which are required to comply with Indian Accounting Standards IndAS shall as hitherto continue to be guided by the guidelines duly approved by their Boards and as per ICAI Advisories for recognition of significant increase in credit risk and computation of Expected Credit Losses However the various additional

resolution plan is implemented under this facility the lending institutions which had signed the ICA within 30 days of invocation shall keep provisions from the date of implementation which are higher of the provisions held as per the extant IRAC norms immediately before implementation or 10 percent of the total debt including the debt securities issued in terms of para 30 held by the ICA signatories postimplementation of the plan residual debt 6 However lending institutions which did not sign the ICA within 30 days of invocation shall immediately upon the expiry of 30 days keep provisions of 20 per cent of the debt on their books as on this date carrying debt or the provisions required as per extant IRAC norms whichever is higher Even in cases where the invocation lapses on account of the thresholds for ICA signing not being met in terms of para 18 such lending institutions which had earlier agreed for invocation but did not sign the ICA shall also be required to hold 20

RBI20202116 DORNoBPBC321 04048202021 dated August 6 2020 as a special window under the Prudential Framework on Resolution of Stressed Assets issued on June 7 2019 The Committee recommendations are not applicable for accounts covered by Part A of the Annex to the above circular ie personal loans and the borrowers not covered by the circular as listed in Paragraph 2 of the annex to the said circular The framework enables lending institutions including NBFCs which are an essential part of the lenders pool under this Framework to implement a Resolution Plan RP in respect of eligible corporate exposure even without change in ownership while classifying such exposure as Standard subject to specified conditions The Resolution Framework inter alia envisages constitution of an Expert Committee Committee under the Chairmanship of Shri K V Kamath with following composition 2 Terms of Reference of the Expert Committee i To identify suitable financial parameters that should be factored into the assumptions underlying RP finalised by the lending institutions under the Resolution Framework The parameters shall cover aspects related to leverage liquidity debt serviceability etc ii To recommend

2020 are eligible under the Framework Invocation Date and implementation Resolution Framework may be invoked not later than December 31 2020 RP needs to be implemented within 180 days from the date of invocation Signing of ICA and provision requirements Resolution process shall be treated as invoked once lenders representing 75 by value and 60 by number Majority Lenders agree to invoke the same ICA to be signed by all lenders within 30 days of invocation Lenders who have signed ICA to make provision higher of 10 or IRAC norms Lenders who have not signed ICA to make a provision higher of 20 or as

with all lending institutions including those who did not sign the ICA shall be downgraded to NPA from the date of implementation of the RP or the date from which the borrower had been classified as NPA before implementation of the plan whichever is earlier In all cases further upgradation shall be subject to implementation of a fresh restructuring under the Prudential Framework or the relevant instructions as applicable to specific category of lending institutions where the Prudential Framework is not applicable Chapter II Approach and Methodology Adopted 1 The first and foremost task before the Committee was to identify the sectors where the impact of Covid19 was visible 2 To have a better understanding of the above objective the Expert Committee held several meetings with various stakeholders through the digital platform details of the meetings are given in Annexure I The Committee also studied the RBIs Financial Stability Report and other Publications and Research Reports It also studied comparison of Q1 FY 2021 with Q1FY 2020 financials of companies across many sectors which clearly indicated stress in several sectors as summarized below 3 The Committee recognizes that The Covid19 pandemic has affected the best of companies These businesses were otherwise viable under preCovid19 scenario Impact is pervasive across several sectors but with varying severity mild moderate and severe 4 Based on past experience it takes a few months to finalize a large restructuring proposal because of the host of compliances as under 5 As per RBIs August 6 2020 circular all the norms applicable to implementation of a RP including mandatory requirements of ICA and specific implementation conditions as laid out in June 7 2019 circular are applicable to all lending institutions for the RP implemented under this circular Item No 6 Page 2 6 Time is of essence at the present juncture Considering the large volume and the fact that only Standard assets are eligible under the proposed scheme a segmented approach of bucketing these accounts under mild moderate and severe stress may ensure quick turnaround To complete this task simplified restructuring for mild and moderate stress may be prescribed Severe stress cases would require comprehensive restructuring 7 The task before the Committee was to select the set of financial parameters where the threshold has to be recommended for each identified sector The financial parameters inter alia should include aspects related to leverage liquidity debt serviceability etc 8 On the evaluation and analysis the following parameters were selected based on their relevance while considering the RP Total Outside Liability Adjusted Tangible Net Worth TOL Adjusted TNW Total Debt EBIDTA Current Ratio Debt Service Coverage Ratio DSCR Average Debt Service Coverage Ratio ADSCR Definitions of Key Ratios 8 These ratios would provide the requisite assessment framework for the RP 9 The Committee decided to source sector specific reports company data from various sources to have a better sectoral outlook and to obtain industry benchmarks to formulate the financial parameters in a rational manner 10 Based on the outstanding and the severity impact the Committee selected the following sectors for the purpose of recommending financial parameters to be factored in the RP The Committee deliberated on the financial parameters applicable to the above 26 sectors which are discussed in Chapter III Chapter III Recommendations on Sector Specific Parameters 1 The following table gives the summary of sector specific threshold parameters recommended by the Committee These parameters were selected by the Committee based on its discussions with the Rating Agencies and lending institutions For this purpose sector reports were obtained from rating agencies and lending institutions as also experience of the banking sector in their own credit appraisal and polices Certain outliers found by the Committee are explained later 2 The sector specific parameters may be considered as guidance for preparation of RP for a borrower in the specified sector The RP may be prepared based on the preCovid19 operating and financial performance of the borrower and impact of Covid19 on its operating and financial performance in Q1 and Q2FY21 to assess the cashflows for FY21 FY22 and subsequent years In these financial projections the threshold TOLAdjusted TNW and Debt EBIDTA ratios should be met by FY23 The other three threshold ratios should be met for each year of the projections starting from FY22 The base case financial projections need to be prepared as part of RP 3 In respect of those sectors where the threshold parameters have not been specified by the Committee lenders can make their own internal assessments for the solvency ratios ie TOLAdj TNW and Total DebtEBIDTA However the current ratio and DSCR shall be 10 and above and ADSCR shall be 12 and above 4 The Committee has uniformly proposed thresholds for current ratio DSCR and ADSCR as in the table below in most of the sectors exceptions flagged in the table The borrowers eligible under the current Framework are Standard Accounts and as such they may require some time to restore their position to preCovid19 levels Automobile Manufacturing We are not prescribing any threshold for Current Ratio due to the just in time inventory business model for raw materials and parts and finished goods inventory is funded by channel financing available from the dealers Aviation 1 Targeted Current Ratio for Airline Industry is kept at 040 and above because of following key reasons Cash and carry model for revenue purpose thereby creating almost nil debtors and higher current liabilities in form of advance received from customers These advances are approximately 2 months of yearly sales of the airline industries The airline enjoys credit of typically 69 months from vendors including fuel payment 2 DSCR is not ascertainable for airline industry since most of the airline companies work on refinancing of debt as a financing strategy As a consequence Avg DSCR is not ascertainable for airline industry Real Estate Considering the typical nature of Real Estate projects the parameters to be considered at project level rather than at entity level Roads In the roads sector the financing is cash flow based and at SPV level where the level of debt is decided at the time of initial project appraisal It may also be noted that the working capital cycle in this sector is negative Accordingly ratios like TOL ATNW DebtEBITDA and Current ratio may not be relevant at the time of restructuring in this sector Since cash flows of several projects are by way of annuity payments the threshold ADSCR has been kept at 110 Trading Wholesale DSCR Avg DSCR is not ascertainable for trading business as most of the companies do not use long term debt for funding their operations and are unlisted Annexure I Details of

https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/MSM_Demonetisation.aspx,Mint Street Memo No 01 Demonetisation and Bank Deposit Growth,Bhupal Singh and Indrajit Roy1 Abstract I Introduction On November 8 2016 currency notes of denominations of 1000 and 500 specified bank notes or SBNs valued at 154 trillion and constituting 869 per cent of the value of total notes in circulation were demonetised The consequent decline in currency in circulation was mirrored in a surge in bank deposits Between October 28 2016 to January 6 2017 notes in circulation declined by about 88 trillion which in turn was largely reflected in an increase of about 4 percentage points in the share of Current Account and Saving Account CASA deposits low cost deposits in aggregate deposits of the banking system Charts 1 and 2 Demonetisation also led to a significant increase in financial intermediation with 48 per cent increase in deposits in Pradhan Mantri JanDhan Yojana PMJDY accounts with addition of 18 million accounts postdemonetisation November 9 to January 25 2017 The latest data indicate that 382 million new accounts were opened until July 26 2017 since demonetisation Chart 32 II Estimates of Excess Deposits Against the above backdrop this study attempts to analyse deposit behaviour with a view to estimating excess deposit growth due to demonetisation First employing certain assumptions a time series model is adopted to assess the normal rate of growth in bank deposits during the demonetisation period and then excess growth is derived juxtaposing it with actual growth Second seven categories of special accounts constituting about 30 per cent of bank deposits are evaluated against the growth recorded during previous years Such accounts are selected given the lack of significant activity in these accounts during normal times and indications of unusual cash deposits The resulting estimates are presented below II1 Estimates based on Aggregate Banking Statistics In what follows the benchmark nominal rate of deposit growth is assumed under alternate scenarios to be i the deposit growth in the corresponding period of 201516 ii the average growth recorded during the corresponding periods of the previous two years ie 201415 and 201516 and iii the growth estimated using ARIMA model Scenario 1 Normal deposit growth proxied by the observed rate in 201516 Aggregate deposits grew by 145 per cent yoy during the period November 11 to December 30 2016 as against 103 per cent during the corresponding period of 2015 indicating a 42 percentage point excess deposit growth due to demonetisation Table 1 In nominal terms excess deposits work out to 38 trillion Assessment for the period November 11 2016 to February 17 2017 reveals that average fortnightly bank deposit growth was 139 per cent 35 percentage points in excess of the assumed normal growth of 104 per cent during the corresponding period of 201516 With a view to factoring in some temporal tapering of deposits if the period up to endMarch 2017 is considered the actual deposit growth of 134 per cent exceeds the estimated growth of 101 per cent by 33 percentage points Scenario 2 Normal deposit growth proxied by average of 201415 and 201516 The average fortnightly yoy growth in bank deposits during November 11December 30 of 201415 and 201516 was 106 per cent while the average deposit growth for the same period of 201617 was 145 per cent Under this scenario excess deposit growth due to demonetisation is estimated at 40 percentage points Table 1 On the same basis deposit growth for the period November 11 to February 17 2017 was 33 percentage points in excess of the deposit growth of 107 per cent based on average of the same period of previous two years If the period up to endMarch 2017 is considered the excess deposit growth works out to 30 percentage points above the average deposit growth of 104 per cent Scenario 3 Estimates based on the univariate forecasting model ARIMA Deposit growth yoy forecast was also carried out using an autoregressive integrated moving average ARIMA 11 model on fortnightly data for the period 201213 to 201617 up to the fortnight ending October 28 2016 where t is the deposit growth series Lags of the series yt1 ytp are autoregressive terms while lags of the forecast errors et1 etq are the moving average terms The model is found to be statistically robust and apposite for shortterm forecast see Annex Tables 1 to 4 and Annex Chart 1 The excess deposit growth due to demonetisation using the model works out to 47 percentage points over the model forecast growth of 98 per cent Table 1 For the period November 11 2016 to February 17 2017 deposit growth was 42 percentage points in excess of the model forecast growth of 97 per cent When the period up to endMarch 2017 is taken into account the excess deposit growth is 38 percentage points over the model forecast growth of 97 per cent II2 Estimation of Excess Deposits based on Specific Bank Accounts Before the discontinuation of overthecounter exchange facility at bank branches on November 25 2016 about 370 billion of SBNs were tendered A significant amount of SBNs flowed into the following special types of accounts Basic Saving Bank Deposit Account BSBDA PMJDY Accounts Kisan Credit Card KCC dormant or inoperative accounts cooperative banks accounts with SCBs bullion traderjewellers accounts and loan accounts The amount of unusual cash deposits has been estimated below using data on these accounts and the following estimation methods Scenario 1 Month over month increase without adjusting for seasonality Estimated cash deposits in these seven types of accounts during NovemberDecember 2016 with 52 banks were 4358 billion Cash deposits in these accounts during SeptemberOctober 2016 were 2701 billion Table 2 Thus the variation of 1657 billion can be assumed to be the increase in cash deposits under these accounts due to demonetisation in the absence of any noticeable activity in such accounts during normal times Scenario 2 Based on yoy growth of aggregate cash deposits The estimated cash deposits in seven types of accounts with 52 banks were 4358 billion during NovemberDecember 2016 and 3065 billion during NovemberDecember 2015 Average yoy growth of net deposits deposit minus withdrawal of all types of accounts of SCBs during NovemberDecember for last 5 years was 92 per cent Table 3 The estimated trend of cash deposits in these accounts during NovemberDecember 2016 is 2783 billion Thus excess cash deposit during NovemberDecember 2016 works out to 1575 billion III Conclusion Excess deposit growth in the banking system during the demonetisation period ie November 11 2016 to December 30 2016 works out to 4047 percentage points If the period up to midFebruary 2017 is taken into account to allow for some surge to taperoff excess deposit growth is in the range of 3342 percentage points Considering some more temporal tapering of deposits the exercise taken up to endMarch 2017 reveals that excess deposit growth would be in the range of 3038 percentage points In nominal terms excess deposits accrued to the banking system due to demonetisation are estimated in the range of 2843 trillion The unusual cash deposit in specific accounts which are usually less active is estimated to be in the range of 1617 trillion Overall there appears to have been a significant increase in bank deposits due to demonetisation which if sustained could have favourable impact on financial savings and their channelisation to capital markets See

https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/MSM_FinancialisationofSavings.aspx,Mint Street Memo No 02 Financialisation of savings Into nonbanking Financial Intermediaries,Manoranjan Dash Bhupal Singh Snehal Herwadkar and Rasmi Ranjan Behera 1 Abstract An important positive impact of demonetisation has been to induce a shift towards formal channels of saving by households During demonetisation and the subsequent period there has been a distinct increase in saving flows into equitydebt oriented mutual funds and life insurance policies Apart from this nonbanking financial companies NBFCs seem to have been positively impacted in terms of collections and disbursals The challenge going forward would be channelising these funds into productive segments of the economy Introduction Demonetisation impacted various financial intermediaries differently As explained in the Mint Street Memo No 1 Demonetisation and Bank Deposit Growth consolidated balance sheet of Scheduled Commercial Banks SCBs experienced excess deposit growth in the postdemonetisation period Nonbanking financial intermediaries such as debtequity oriented mutual funds and insurance companies also gained and the aggregate balance sheet of the NBFC sector expanded by 145 per cent during 201617 This note provides a detailed breakup of the financialisation of saving into three nonbanking financial intermediaries mutual funds insurance companies and nonbanking financial companies NBFCs 1 Mutual Funds Reduction in interest rates on bank deposits after demonetisation and decline in gold price enhanced the relative attractiveness of both debt and equity oriented mutual funds Reflective of this assets under management by mutual funds AUM touched an alltime high of more than 175 trillion by endMarch 2017 and further increased to 20 trillion at endJuly 2017 The buoyant equity market also improved the attractiveness of equityoriented mutual funds Resource mobilisation under equity schemes more than doubled during this period There were also net inflows in the incomedebt schemes in November 2016June 2017 in contrast to net outflows in November 2015June 2016 This was reflected in a sharp increase in the overall resources mobilised by mutual funds during November 2016June 2017 compared with the same period last year Table 1 Higher resource mobilisation by mutual funds after demonetisation has mainly been driven by retail and high net worth individual HNI investors 2 Life Insurance Companies Premia collected by life insurance companies more than doubled in November 2016 Table 2 Premia collected by Life Insurance Corporation LIC of India increased by 142 per cent yoy in November 2016 collection by private sector life insurance companies increased by nearly 50 per cent About 85 per cent of the total collections by LIC of India in November 2016 were under the single premium policies which are paid in lump sum unlike the nonsingle premium policies that can be paid monthly quarterly or annually LIC of India revised downward the annuity rates of its immediate annuity plan Jeevan Akshay VI purchased from December 1 2016 which might have created a spurt in collections in the month of November 2016 for LIC of India The cumulative collections during November 2016 to January 2017 increased by 46 per cent over the same period of the previous year Despite subsequent slowdown in the growth rate the premium collections still witnessed double digit growth during MayJune 2017 3 NonBanking Financial Companies NBFCs Loans disbursed by all categories of NBFCs declined significantly in November 2016 compared with the monthly average disbursals during AprilOctober 2016 especially by micro finance companies NBFCMFIs whose business is more cash intensive Table 3a Disbursements by Asset Finance Companies AFCs and Loan Companies LCs continued to contract up to February 2017 Disbursals turned positive from March 2017 and grew at a higher rate than the monthly average disbursals recorded during AprilOctober 2016 In the case of MFIs however disbursals continued to contract in comparison with the monthly average of disbursals during AprilOctober 2016 possibly in view of the prevalent uncertainty of loan waivers by state governments Note Figures in parenthesis pertain to number of companies covered Source Reserve Bank of India In contrast loans and collections ie repayments of loans due of AFCs and LCs during November 2016June 2017 grew significantly over the monthly average collections during AprilOctober 2016 Table 3b Collections by NBFCMicro Finance Companies MFIs declined during November 2016February 2017 visvis AprilOctober 2016 but witnessed an improvement during the months of March May and June 2017 Finally bank credit to NBFCs decelerated from 51 per cent yoy in October 2016 to 13 per cent in November 2016 but subsequently improved to 109 per cent in March 2017 In terms of the returns submitted by the reporting NBFCs loans and advances by NBFCs increased broadly at the same rate in the year ending March 2017 164 per cent as in the year ending March 2016 166 per cent Table 4 Going Forward Demonetisation appears to have led to an acceleration in the financialisation of savings In parallel there is a shift towards greater formalisation of the economy in the near term aided by the introduction of goods and services tax GST and regulations such as the Real Estate Regulation and Development Act 2016 RERA and the Benami Transactions Prohibition Amendment Act 2016 These developments may also incentivise greater shift from physical to financial savings The continuing weakness in real estate activity and moderation in housing prices are also likely to further help channel funds away from physical assets into financial savings Finally the recent deceleration in inflation as also inflation expectations has had the effect of raising real incomes and returns for households which may provide further impetus to financial savings 1 Manoranjan Dash

accountants and social workers went to several industrial clusters which have come up on their own without state assistance or any establishment prop up including banking and educational institutions It took them next several years of study to travel to over 40 important industrial clusters Ludhina Batala Amritsar Rajkot Surat Baroda Morvi in the north and west to Tirupur Namakkal Karur Sivakasi and Tutukudy The study also included the leather cluster in Agra and Kanpur dominated by Dalits These industrial clusters which including the artisan clusters numbering over 10000 constituted the backbone of over 50 Indian economy 60 of manufacturing and exports The empirical study uncovered four aspects of the noncorporate economy about which very little was known till then One there is intense relation between caste and entrepreneurship Two this resulted in communitarian competition which led to entrepreneurship Three the castes mobilised and circulated capital and shared information within Four the property built by caste in a cluster was shared with other castes instantly as evident from several of the clusters The study revealed that India was too complex and too vast and too diversified a country for one common policy particularly without understanding the diversities Many of the findings of the study was later supported by the World Bank in its World Development Report The study team led by Shri Gurumurthy identified relations dominated growth and development of entrepreneurship and business The study zeroed in on social capital as the major drive of development an idea which later found expression in the writings of Francis Fukuyama in his famous book Trust Later many books came to be written on such and similar issues The study also revealed

The forty fifth meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee MPC constituted under Section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 was held during October 4 to 6 2023 2 The meeting was attended by all the members Dr Shashanka Bhide Honorary Senior Advisor National Council of Applied Economic Research Delhi Dr Ashima Goyal Emeritus Professor Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research Mumbai Prof Jayanth R Varma Professor Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad Dr Rajiv Ranjan Executive Director the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB2c of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 Dr Michael Debabrata Patra Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das Governor 3 According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 the Reserve Bank shall publish on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following namely the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee ascribed to such member on the resolution adopted in the said meeting and the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under subsection 11 of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting 4 The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence households inflation expectations corporate sector performance credit conditions the outlook for the industrial services and infrastructure sectors and the projections of professional forecasters The MPC also reviewed in detail the staffs macroeconomic projections and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below Resolution 5 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation the Monetary Policy Committee MPC at its meeting today October 6 2023 decided to The standing deposit facility SDF rate remains unchanged at 625 per cent and the marginal standing facility MSF rate and the Bank Rate at 675 per cent These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the mediumterm target for consumer price index CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of 2 per cent while supporting growth The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below Assessment Global Economy 6 Global growth is losing momentum Inflation is easing gradually but remains well above target in major economies Concerns about higher for longer rates are imparting volatility to global financial markets Sovereign bond yields have hardened the US dollar has appreciated and equity markets have corrected Emerging market economies EMEs are experiencing currency depreciation and volatile capital flows Domestic Economy 7 Real gross domestic product GDP posted a growth of 78 per cent yearonyear yoy in Q1202324 AprilJune underpinned by private consumption and investment demand 8 Southwest monsoon rainfall recovered during September and ended 6 per cent below the long period average The acreage under kharif crops was 02 per cent higher than a year ago The index of industrial production rose by 57 per cent in July core industries output expanded by 121 per cent in August Purchasing managers indices PMIs and other high frequency indicators of the services sector exhibited healthy expansion in AugustSeptember 9 On the demand front urban consumption is buoyant while rural demand is showing signs of revival Investment activity is benefitting from public sector capex Strong growth is seen in steel consumption cement production as well as in imports and production of capital goods Merchandise exports and nonoil nongold imports remained in contraction in August although the pace of decline eased Services exports improved in August 10 CPI headline inflation surged by 26 percentage points to 74 per cent in July due to spike in vegetable prices before moderating somewhat in August to 68 per cent Fuel inflation edged up to 43 per cent in August Core inflation ie CPI excluding food and fuel softened to 49 per cent during JulyAugust 2023 11 As on September 22 2023 money supply M3 expanded by 108 per cent yoy and bank credit grew by 153 per cent Indias foreign exchange reserves stood at US 5869 billion as on September 29 2023 Outlook 12 The nearterm inflation outlook is expected to improve on the back of vegetable price correction and the recent reduction in LPG prices The future trajectory will be conditioned by a number of factors like lower area sown under pulses dip in reservoir levels El Nio conditions and volatile global energy and food prices According to the Reserve Banks enterprise surveys manufacturing firms expect higher input cost pressures but marginally lower growth in selling prices in Q3 compared to the previous quarter Services and infrastructure firms expect a moderation in growth of input costs and selling prices Taking into account these factors CPI inflation is projected at 54 per cent for 202324 with Q2 at 64 per cent Q3 at 56 per cent and Q4 at 52 per cent with risks evenly balanced CPI inflation for Q1202425 is projected at 52 per cent Chart 1 13 Domestic demand conditions are expected to benefit from the sustained buoyancy in services revival in rural demand consumer and business optimism the governments thrust on capex and healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates Headwinds from global factors like geopolitical tensions volatile financial markets and energy prices and climate shocks pose risks to the growth outlook Taking all these factors into consideration real GDP growth for 202324 is projected at 65 per cent with Q2 at 65 per cent Q3 at 60 per cent and Q4 at 57 per cent with risks evenly balanced Real GDP growth for Q1202425 is projected at 66 per cent Chart 2 14 The MPC observed that the unprecedented food price shocks are impinging on the evolving trajectory of inflation and that recurring incidence of such overlapping shocks can impart generalisation and persistence Accordingly the MPC resolved to remain on high alert given the prevailing environment of elevated global food and energy prices and global financial market volatility While vegetable prices may undergo further correction and core inflation is easing the MPC noted that headline inflation is ruling above the tolerance band and its alignment with the target is getting interrupted Hence monetary policy needs to remain actively disinflationary Domestic economic activity is holding up well and is expected to be boosted by festive consumption demand pick up in investment intentions and improving consumer and business outlook As the cumulative policy repo rate hike of 250 basis points is still working its way through the economy the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent in this meeting but with preparedness to undertake appropriate and timely policy actions should the situation so warrant The MPC will remain resolute in its commitment to aligning inflation to the target and anchoring inflation expectations The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target while supporting growth 15 All members of the MPC Dr Shashanka Bhide Dr Ashima Goyal Prof Jayanth R Varma Dr Rajiv Ranjan Dr Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent 16 Dr Shashanka Bhide Dr Ashima Goyal Dr Rajiv Ranjan Dr Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns to the target while supporting growth Prof Jayanth R Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution 17 The minutes of the MPCs meeting will be published on October 20 2023 18 The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during December 68 2023 Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent Statement by Dr Shashanka Bhide 19 The spell of subdued overall price pressures during Q1 FY 202324 with the headline CPI inflation at less than 5 per cent was broken by the spike in the vegetable prices pushing the headline inflation to 74 per cent in July and 68 per cent in August respectively While the sharp increase seen during JulyAugust appears transitory pressures on the price conditions remain 20 The uneven distribution of rainfall in the current monsoon period is a source of concern on food prices with cereals pulses and spices experiencing double digit price rise from June to August While the kharif sown area is estimated to be at roughly the same level as in the previous year area under some of the key crops such as pulses and some of the coarse grains is lower than in the previous year Trade and supply management policies of the government would moderate the price effects of any supplydemand mismatches but favourable weather for the rabi season would be crucial for keeping food inflation moderate 21 The nonfood segment of the CPI basket registered moderate price rise during JulyAugust CPI excluding food and fuel core CPI registered a rise of 49 per cent YOY basis in both July and August down from 52 per cent in June While clothing and footwear health education and personal care effects registered a price rise of above 5 per cent in August the vulnerability of the core to shocks in the petroleum fuel prices remains significant as a range of transport services prices would be sensitive to fuel prices 22 The recent Enterprise surveys by the RBI point to continued input price pressures in Q3 and Q4 in FY 202324 and expectations of higher selling prices particularly in the manufacturing and infrastructure sectors as compared to the services sector The overall business situation is also expected by the sample firms to improve in Q3 and Q4 in the manufacturing sector The Business Inflation Expectations Survey conducted in July by IIM Ahmedabad indicates a rise in the one year ahead expected costbased inflation rate 23 The RBIs Inflation Expectations Survey of urban households conducted in September 2023 indicates a decline in median inflation expectations for 3months ahead and one yearahead 24 The RBIs Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted in September 2023 points to a median forecast of 66 per cent headline inflation rate in Q2 followed by lower rates of 55 per cent and 51 per cent in Q3 and Q4 respectively The core inflation1 is projected at 49 per cent in Q2 followed by 47 per cent and 46 per cent in Q3 and Q4 respectively 25 Weak global economic growth and external demand have kept the global price pressures down The global fuel and energy prices volatility and firming up of some of the food commodity prices are a concern in the shortterm in view of the persistent geopolitical tensions and vulnerability to adverse climate shocks Financial market volatility has also meant volatile capital flows 26 Considering these broad trends CPI headline inflation rate for FY202324 is projected at 54 per cent unchanged from the projections in the August MPC minutes The projections for Q2 Q3 and Q4 are at 64 56 and 52 per cent respectively broadly in line with the August projections 27 On the growth front YOY GDP growth in Q1 FY 202324 at 78 per cent follows sharply higher Q1 growth in the previous two years reflecting the resilience of growth momentum However the growth pattern continues to be uneven across sectors with the services which include construction registering growth rate of 10 per cent while that of industry being lower 46 per cent The GVA from manufacturing accounting for around 80 per cent of GVA from industry rose by 47 per cent Within the services all the major segments registered higher YOY growth rates than the overall growth rate of aggregate GVA However one segment Trade hotels transport and communication is yet to reach its GVA level of Q1201920 The official estimate of GDP growth for Q1 came slightly lower than RBIs projection of 8 per cent 28 The RBIs recent enterprise surveys indicate expectations of improved demand conditions in Q2 and subsequent two quarters in FY 202324 with relatively higher optimism in the manufacturing sector as compared to services and infrastructure sectors 29 The divergence in growth performance also reflects demand conditions On the demand side investment spending increased at a faster rate than consumption with the external demand being a drag for the overall demand growth During AprilJuly 2023 period index of industrial production IIP data reflects strong YOY growth of infrastructure construction sector 122 per cent and consumer nondurables 68 per cent but weaker growth in consumer durables 27 per cent 30 The RBIs recent Consumer Confidence Survey of urban households shows cautious optimism The broader measure of sentiments used in the survey comprising oneyear ahead expectations of general economic conditions employment scenario and household income reflects improvement over the current period However assessment of the current situation is cautious as the increase in nonessential expenditure is lower both in the current period and oneyear ahead as compared to the previous round of the survey The high inflation in JulyAugust seems to have moderated optimism in the present round of the survey 31 The recent high frequency indicators of economic activity reflect continuation of the growth trends at an aggregate level The PMIs for manufacturing and services remained at high levels in July and August although the index fell in the case of services while it rose for manufacturing indicating expectation of expansion in output in the short term Nonfood bank credit GST collections and domestic and international air passenger traffic registered double digit YOY growth in August and September The drag is in the external sector merchandise exports and imports declined YoY basis through the current financial year although the extent of decline has moderated in August Services imports declined YOY basis in July and August with exports growing at a modest 84 per cent in August Slower YOY growth is seen in the case of new launches and sales of housing units in Q1 FY 202324 as compared to the previous quarter 32 The median projection of GDP growth for FY 202324 from the RBIs September 2023 round of Survey of Professional Forecasters is 62 per cent rising marginally by 01 percentage point from the forecast in July 33 Overall the demand conditions are expected to sustain the growth momentum observed in the August meeting of the MPC although the concerns emerging from the uncertain global market conditions pose downside risks The GDP growth projection for FY 202324 has been retained at 65 per cent with the quarterly projections for Q2 Q3 and Q4 also remaining the same as in the August meeting 34 The growth momentum is projected to be sustained in the present financial year despite the erratic distribution of monsoon and the weak external conditions based on more stable domestic demand conditions The points flagged in the August meeting regarding the global economic conditions and incomplete transmission of the policy rate actions undertaken are still relevant at this juncture It is necessary to assess the strength of the growth trajectory and inflation outlook in the medium term keeping in view the fact that the projected headline inflation remains above 5 per cent in the final three quarters of the current financial year 35 Therefore I vote i to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent and ii to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth Statement by Dr Ashima Goyal 36 The global picture continues to be mixed The interpretation of the Feds communication as higher for longer has led to US ten year yields crossing 45 especially as the US fiscal deficit continues to rise There is fear that firms will be in trouble as they refinance low interest loans taken during the pandemic But at the same time the Fed is also saying its actions will be data dependent Markets should take comfort that rates will not continue to be high regardless of what happens Chinese excess inventories and deflation are contributing to reducing manufacturing costs in most countries Global growth is expected to fall in FY24 but a turnaround is possible in FY25 37 Indian growth trends also continue to be mixed Some export dependent industries have slowed Pentup demand is waning for services but remains robust Many indicators point towards a revival in private investment post recovery but some surveys suggest election uncertainty may delay projects This is unlikely however in sectors that are close to full capacity utilization with robust domestic demand 38 There are some indicators of strong domestic demand PMIs continue to be high Confidence has improved for consumers and firms The current account deficit CAD is up from 12 of GDP in FY22 to 2 in FY23 This equals the excess of investment over savings Household physical savings is measured as identical to household physical investment savings in India so it is the net financial savings that affect the CAD These are down to 51 of GDP in FY23 from around 7 of GDP prepandemic A post pandemic surge in net financial savings did not last and they fell to 72 of GDP in FY22 39 Gross household financial savings remain high however It was household financial liabilities that increased from 38 of GDP in 202122 to 58 of GDP in 202223 by a similar 21 fall in net financial savings The rise in financial liabilities implies a rise in household physical investment and shows the interest sensitivity of demand in India with a youthful population borrowing to acquire assets In FY23 households shifted towards such borrowing since real rates became positive only towards the end of the year Pass through to bank deposit rates was more delayed but this is happening now and bank deposits are rising We need to wait and see if the share of financial savings rises again after postpandemic disturbances As investment and income rises savings also tend to rise Already in Q4 FY23 net financial savings rose to 7 of GDP from 4 of GDP in Q3 FY23 40 There are signs of a revival in investment now after more than a decade Sharp financial tightening in 2011 and 2017 punctured such past revivals and led to persistent slowdowns So it is important to ensure a sustained and sustainable revival this time There is no excess lending or an infrastructure boom this time but a healthy gradual rise 41 Indian household debt is low by international standards but a sudden rise can be a concern It is best to restrain overenthusiasm in good times and thus avoid a crash Prudential tightening such as raising LTV ratios or risk weights would be preferable to raising policy rates more There is already some reversal of remissions given in the pandemic times After the firmlending based NPAs most banks are trying to increase retail loans These are secured or based on cash or salary flows But it will help to make sure lending continues to be riskbased and internal assessments are robust 42 Despite the large inflation spikes to vegetable and crude oil prices there is favourable news on inflation The monsoon is ending near normal spikes have passed with no secondround effects as core inflation continues to soften The government is undertaking many supplyside measures to reduce inflation 43 The headline inflation forecast of 54 for FY 24 gives a comfortably positive real repo rate Therefore I vote for a pause in the repo rate and also vote for the stance on withdrawal of accommodation in order to signal the MPCs determination to reach its 4 target This stance rules out a rate cut It allows a rise but that will not be required unless there are second round effects from the repeated supply shocks So far there are no signs of such pass through The guidance therefore is that future moves will be datadependent 44 Liquidity has been tight in the past 2 months so that the weighted average call rate WACR has often been above the repo rate This first happened in endSeptember 2022 suggesting withdrawal of pandemic time excess liquidity was adequate After that the WACR has spent more time at the top than at the bottom of the LAF corridor Endogenous short term liquidity adjustments at the edges keep the WACR within this band 45 Since March 31 2014 average annual growth of broad money was 10 less than nominal income growth although reserve money growth varied widely over the pandemic and demonetization periods Over December 2009 to February 2014 prior to the adoption of inflation targeting average annual broad money growth was 150 46 But finetuning of liquidity is not as yet adequate to keep the WACR at the MPC mandated repo rate Moreover shocks can be so large that shortterm liquidity is unable to compensate Then durable liquidity must be adjusted OMO purchases or sales that affect durable liquidity may be required depending on liquidity conditions 47 Research finds that quantity of money as well as rates matter in Indian conditions Both too much and too little liquidity has adverse effects Liquidity aligned to stance increases the impact of a change in the Repo Rate2 But due to a large informal sector and many financial institutions with no recourse to liquidity windows large liquidity deficits lead to liquidity hoarding and more leakages3 We have seen as liquidity tightens banks with surplus become reluctant to lend to those with deficits or participate in longer tenor VRRR despite profit opportunities They prefer using RBIs overnight windows Impediments to developing an active overnight interbank call money market have to be addressed 48 Analysts are again concerned about falling interest differentials with the US But markets seem to understand that Indian macros are relatively more stable today In September despite a 46 bps rise in US 10 year yields Indian 10 year Gsecs rose only 5 bps The IMF gave the average spread for emerging markets at 200 bps in 2022 India still exceeded that at 280 bps in September Despite narrower differentials ECBs and other debt inflows continue Even so they are a small and therefore a manageable share of Indian markets In addition index inclusion is around the corner More than higher Indian rates it is lower country risk a stable currency and higher expected growth that keeps FPI here There is the lure of high US risk free rates but since higher Indian rates cannot compensate for this the latter are best aligned to the domestic cycle Statement by Prof Jayanth R Varma 49 Since the August meeting the risks to inflation have increased but only slightly First the official end of season report on the Monsoon confirmed that the rainfall was only 94 of the Long Period Average This small shortfall coupled with the spatiotemporal dispersion in the rainfall could cause some volatility in food prices However the effect is more likely to consist of a few short lived inflation spikes rather than a sustained rise in inflation The second factor is the indication in recent months of a possible geopolitical realignment of the two largest OPEC producers This has imparted considerable volatility to crude oil prices in recent weeks A sharp fall in crude prices while the MPC meeting was in progress suggests that a slowing world economy does place a limit on the upswing in crude prices Therefore I think that the impact of OPEC geopolitics would be limited to slowing the pace of decline in inflation and is unlikely to cause a reversal of this trajectory 50 Turning to growth the outlook has improved modestly because of increasing consumer confidence as indicated in the RBI surveys This increased confidence must also be seen in the light of household financial savings data released by the RBI in September The data shows that consumers have incurred financial liabilities and reduced net financial savings to support consumption This willingness to consume at the cost of reducing savings is very important because it is household consumption that has been propping up the economy in the face of headwinds from fiscal consolidation weak external demand and tepid capital investment It is possible that this consumer confidence could become a self fulfilling prophecy as robust consumption demand stimulates growth generates income and strengthens household balance sheets Even if that does not happen global experience suggests that a debt fuelled consumption boom can last several years before petering out Either way the medium term growth outlook looks somewhat stronger than it did during the last meeting though several headwinds still remain 51 The changes in the outlooks for both inflation and growth are quite modest and the real repo rate is already quite high I therefore support the decision to keep repo rate unchanged In my view the real interest rate based on projected inflation is high enough to glide inflation towards the target within a reasonable period 52 As regards the stance I continue to have the same reservations as in the past Successive meetings that promise to withdraw accommodation while actually keeping rates unchanged do not enhance the credibility of the MPC I would much prefer a stance in which words are consistent with the actions Moreover at this point of time the guidance that the market really needs is not about how high the terminal repo rate would be but about how long the rate would be maintained at a high level It would therefore be useful for the MPC to communicate its intention to keep real interest rates high enough for as long as is necessary to drive projected inflation close to the 4 target on a sustainable basis Statement by Dr Rajiv Ranjan 53 At this juncture three global trends among many others need to be closely watched rising crude oil prices rising US yields and rising US dollar On the domestic front the containment of food price pressures particularly vegetable prices which is reversing is an important assumption behind retaining our inflation projection at 54 per cent during 202324 Core inflation CPI excluding food and fuel continued to register further softening to 49 per cent In fact almost all exclusion and trimmed mean measures of inflation have registered a decline in recent months a marked change from 202223 wherein core inflation remained sticky at highly elevated levels The sequential saar momentum for core inflation was at 45 per cent in August with 3month moving average below 4 per cent as per data available till August Threshold diffusion indices4 of CPI also indicate a significant slowdown in the rate of price increases across CPI core in the financial year so far Sustained deflation in WPI nonfood manufactured product inflation is also a comforting factor for core inflation Moreover moderation of services inflation to close to 4 per cent continues to be a relief as they tend to be stickier as seen in advanced economies 54 There was also further progress on anchoring of household inflation expectations with 3month ahead and 1year ahead inflation expectations having seen a cumulative decline of 170 bps and 110 bps respectively since September 2022 Important point to note is that the sharp jump in vegetable prices have not deterred anchoring of inflation expectations with relatively less impact of food inflation on persistence of core inflation But this has to be watched carefully Going forward waning of transitory food price shocks the ongoing transmission of past monetary policy actions improvement in supply chains strong supply side intervention by the Government and likely lower rate of increase in selling prices by firms as per the RBI enterprise surveys is expected to moderate inflation to 52 per cent in Q4 202324 and further to 43 per cent in Q4 202425 If these projections hold the alignment of inflation to the target could be underway But we need to guard against risks from recurring weather related events and rise in global energy prices 55 On the growth front with GDP growth at 78 per cent for Q1202324 and our nowcast of around 65 per cent for Q2 it seems to be tracking our projection of 65 per cent for the full financial year The third quarter would also be buoyed by festival related demand On the supply side manufacturing activity is gaining traction with corporate results in Q2 expected to be aided by strong demand and easing input cost pressures The negative deflator around 25 for JulyAugust and base effects will also extend support to the real GVA growth in the manufacturing sector in Q2 PMI future activity index in September signalled elevated level of confidence for manufacturing Survey results show that optimism on demand for manufacturing goods is high and consumer confidence outlook has also improved significantly Services sector growth continues to remain robust 56 Broadbasing of economic activity is also reflected in the data on household savings Though net financial savings of households moderated to 51 per cent of GDP in 202223 mainly due to significant rise in financial liabilities of households both from bank and nonbank sources 58 per cent of GDP from 38 per cent in 202122 the gross financial savings increased in absolute terms by 139 per cent in 202223 over the previous year Moreover household borrowings reflect higher spending on real estate vehicles consumer goods among others This implies that the overall savings of households is expected to hold steady with compositional shift in favour of physical savings5 This would be growth supportive either through direct addition to gross capital formation or by assisting upturn in private capex Higher investment and income would reinforce higher savings as we have seen in Q4202223 when the net household financial savings normalised to its longterm average of 70 per cent from a low range of 40 to 46 per cent in the first three quarters of 202223 57 The concerns regarding statistical discrepancy on the expenditure side estimates at 28 per cent of GDP for Q1202324 34 per cent of GDP in Q1202223 are unfounded This discrepancy varies from negative to positive ranging from 48 per cent to 64 per cent in the new GDP series during Q1201112 to Q1202324 and it eventually evens out In the prepandemic period Q1201112 to Q3201920 on an average the share of discrepancy in GDP was 09 per cent while in the post pandemic period Q4201920 to Q1202324 it has averaged 04 per cent As per the global practice the production approach of compiling national accounts statistics NAS is considered to be firmer and the NAS presents discrepancy with the expenditure approach of GDP compilation explicitly in its regular releases Sources and Methods NSO 2012 adhering to the recommendations by the system of national accounts SNA 2008 Nevertheless there is a need to improve GDP estimates from the expenditure side so that evolving dynamics of demand side components are captured appropriately 58 Given that inflation expectations are backward looking in emerging markets including India occurrences of multiple large adverse supply shocks run the risk of a drift in inflation expectations from underlying trend which could eventually stall the ongoing disinflation process Such supply shocks are challenging and test the inflation fighting credibility of central banks Though transitory relative price changes in the economy that may spur temporary bouts of inflation may be looked through monetary policy also needs to be watchful to see that large and frequent supply side shocks does not trigger generalised increase in prices6 Past such instances in India as in 2020 do give credence to MPCs judgement with regard to optimal response to supply shocks with an objective to anchoring inflation expectations rather than inflation per se Besides the sustained fall in core inflation as mentioned earlier vouches for its transitory nature going ahead 59 Overall with growth and inflation broadly moving in anticipated direction monetary policy needs to hold on while earnestly persevering with disinflationary approach and remaining watchful with readiness to act if the situation demands This calls for continuation of withdrawal of accommodation stance for monetary policy so as to facilitate further transmission of the cumulative policy repo rate hike of 250 basis points on the economy Thus I vote for pause in repo rate and continue with the stated stance Statement by Dr Michael Debabrata Patra 60 Within the dual mandate given to the MPC by the RBI Act price stability is accorded primacy Only when price stability is secured on an enduring basis against all threats to it can attention turn to the objective of growth Without price stability growth cannot sustain the benefits of expanding GDP and employment will be frittered away by the erosion of purchasing power hurting those the most that eke out livelihoods just to meet the costs of food shelter and bare essentials 61 The fight against inflation in the wake of the war in Ukraine has been arduous and herculean by comparison the moderation of inflation from the high reaches to which it had surged in the first quarter of 202223 has been grudging and underwhelming The anchoring of inflation expectations is incomplete and muddied by uncertainty going by the increase in variability of median expectations of households and the underperformance of revenues of businesses relative to their profits There is also growing evidence that inflation is undermining growth people are not increasing discretionary spending in view of high inflation and this is slowing sales growth of corporations 62 As the economy negotiates the rapids of the second and third quarters of 202324 the trajectory of inflation is being buffeted by price shocks related to perishables Surprisingly they are producing inordinately high and painful spikes in the headline that are unacceptable from the point of view of the overall welfare of our societies When headline inflation faces price pressures from perishables like vegetables the standard operating procedure of monetary policy is to look through the transitory impact of their first round effects and await mean reversion Increasingly however these socalled transitory shocks test our buffers and policy responses given their unanticipated nature Moreover these socalled transitory shocks recur with high intensity and disturbing force Price pressures accumulate in the inflation formation process imparting hysteresis to inflation expectations and potentially to actual inflation outcomes This would be unfortunate at a time when our surveys show that in September 2023 households inflation perceptions have fallen by 50 basis points bps since July 2023 with expectations of lower price and inflationary pressures across most product groups and categories of respondents 63 Inflation prints for September and October will need to be monitored carefully to look out for the moderation that our projections anticipate If we tame inflation durably we will prepare the ground for a long innings of strong and stable growth Our projections anticipate that growth will gather positive momentum from the second quarter onwards Monetary policy can contribute by remaining sufficiently disinflationary without being overly restraining Accordingly I vote for maintaining status quo on the policy repo rate and persevering with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation in this meeting of the MPC Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das 64 Global economic activity is decelerating under the impact of tight financial conditions though it is proving to be more resilient than expected earlier Headline inflation is moderating but it remains above target levels in major economies Monetary policy settings could remain tighter for longer in major advanced economies Growth remains uneven in many of these countries 65 Against the backdrop of this challenging global environment domestic economic activity in India has exhibited resilience with growth projected at 65 per cent during 202324 India is poised to become the new growth engine of the world backed by its strong domestic macroeconomic fundamentals and buffers The judicious policy mix pursued during the recent years to deal with multiple and unparalleled shocks has fostered economic stability Balance sheets of banks and corporates are strong and healthy Construction travel and transportation and financial real estate and professional services continue to maintain strong performance The upcoming festival season is expected to give further impetus to households spending Private sector investment is gathering pace with easing input cost pressures Consumer outlook surveys have turned more optimistic Business sentiment among manufacturing services and infrastructure companies is also optimistic Both manufacturing and services PMI readings indicate a healthy expansion in these sectors The external sector has remained eminently manageable despite global headwinds 66 The heightened inflationary pressures during JulyAugust 2023 following the spike in vegetables prices has once again shown that headline inflation remains vulnerable to recurring and overlapping food price shocks Adverse weather events unseasonal rains skewed monsoon rainfall and unprecedented heat waves have been major sources of food inflation pressures in recent years Moreover the intensity of food price shocks triggered by such events has increased with the month of July registering the highest monthovermonth increase in food prices in the current CPI series 2012100 Such recurring supply side shocks are making episodes of high inflation more than transient The spike in vegetable prices has likely corrected substantially in September and inflation is expected to fall significantly below the upper tolerance level of 6 per cent The moderation in inflation in September would also be aided by the sharp reduction in household LPG prices in endAugust The projections suggest that throughout much of Q3202324 food inflation pressures may not see a sustained easing but ample buffer stocks of food grains softening edible oil prices and governments proactive supply side interventions are expected to keep check on unusual price spikes of key food items Even as headline inflation experienced considerable volatility a silver lining has been the declining core inflation supported by declining costpush pressures and ongoing transmission of past monetary policy actions 67 Going forward inflation outlook continues to be beset with uncertainties especially from adverse weather events the playout of El Nio conditions uncertainties in global food and energy prices and volatility in global financial markets Inflation expectations of households both three months and a year ahead have however moved together to single digit for the first time since the COVID19 pandemic In this situation monetary policy must remain actively disinflationary to ensure that ongoing disinflation process progresses smoothly 68 Liquidity in the banking system is expected to remain adequate in the coming months to meet the productive requirements of the economy with expected pickup in government spending although festivalrelated currency withdrawals may provide some counterbalance The Reserve Bank has maintained a flexible and adaptive approach to liquidity management It will remain nimble footed and ensure that liquidity is actively managed by undertaking whatever operations are necessary from time to time including open market operation sales OMOsales Needless to state the timing and quantum of such operations will depend on the evolving liquidity conditions 69 To sum up domestic economic growth is maintaining the momentum Our fundamental goal is to align inflation with the 40 per cent target and anchor inflation expectations Recurring incidences of large and overlapping supply side shocks bring with them the risks of generalisation of inflation impulses possible loss of monetary policy credibility and deanchoring of inflation expectations Monetary policy has to remain extra alert and ready to act if the situation warrants The hard earned macroeconomic stability has to be preserved Accordingly I vote for keeping the policy repo rate unchanged in this meeting of the MPC and continuing the focus on withdrawal of accommodation Yogesh

Das Governor Reserve Bank of India Dr Michael D Patra Deputy Governor Reserve Bank of India Shri M Rajeshwar Rao Deputy Governor Reserve Bank of India Shri T Rabi Sankar Deputy Governor Reserve Bank of India Shri Swaminathan J Deputy Governor Reserve Bank of India Dr O P Mall Executive Director Reserve Bank of India Dr Rajiv Ranjan Executive Director Reserve Bank of India Moderator Shri Yogesh Dayal Chief General Manager Reserve Bank of India Yogesh Dayal Hello everyone and welcome to the Reserve Bank of India for this post Monetary policy press conference As always we have here our respected Governor Shri Shaktikanta Das and along with him our Deputy Governors Dr M D Patra Shri M Rajeshwar Rao Shri T Rabi Sankar Shri Swaminathan J and also with us today our Executive Directors Dr O P Mall and Dr Rajiv Ranjan With this I welcome all of you to the RBIs press conference and before going ahead with the press conference I will request the Governor to make a few opening remarks Over to you Sir Shaktikanta Das Thank you As I have done on previous occasions I would like to summarise whatever I have said in my statement and I have nine points very quickly 1 Domestic economic activity continues to be resilient India is poised to become the new growth engine of the world 2 Declining core inflation is a silver line But headline CPI inflation remains vulnerable to recurring and overlapping food price shocks 3 The MPC remains highly alert and will not hesitate to take timely and appropriate action if the situation warrants 4 It is emphatically reiterated that the inflation target is 4 and not 2 to 6 Hence monetary policy needs to remain actively disinflationary at the current juncture 5 Liquidity will be actively managed consistent with the monetary policy stance OMO sales will be undertaken as necessary 6 Banks with surplus funds are encouraged to lend in the interbank call market for better returns instead of passively parking them in the SDF 7 The financial sector balance sheet remains robust while the Reserve Bank is closely monitoring the emerging trends Banks and NBFCs are expected to strengthen their internal surveillance mechanisms and institute suitable safeguards wherever necessary 8 Financial stability is fundamental to price stability and growth That is the core principle which we follow 9 The external sector is eminently manageable Thank you Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir for those opening remarks I will begin the press conference by inviting Mr Anup Roy from Bloomberg to ask his question Anup Roy Bloomberg Sir this is regarding the OMO announcement that you did So will there be a calendar for OMO and is this in preparation for the JP Morgan bond index inclusion Shaktikanta Das As I have said in my statement the first thing I would like to say is that it has nothing to do with the bond index inclusion and let me reiterate that it is a part of our domestic liquidity management With regard to the calendar I have said that we will watch the evolving trends There are several moving parts in the whole liquidity scenario We will watch the evolving trends and we will notify as and when it becomes necessary So we do not at the moment propose to give a calendar Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will move on to Mr Manojit Saha from Business Standard Manojit Saha Business Standard Good afternoon Sir You have said that the transmission is still not complete while saying that the stance is withdrawal of accommodation that is maintained Does the RBI expect banks to further adjust their rates so that transmission is complete Are you worried that a change to a neutral stance will dilute your resolve or will signal a dilution of your resolve to act on inflation Shaktikanta Das A change of stance to neutral will be on the table when the situation becomes so At the moment the rate hike is still incomplete I have given the numbers in my statement We have increased the repo rate by 50 basis points but it has not fully translated to either the deposit rates or the lending rates of the bank There is still some distance to be covered So we would expect that to align with the increase in the repo rate and therefore the stance remains withdrawal of accommodation Manojit Saha Business Standard Why OMO sales when liquidity is already in deficit Do you expect the deficit Do you have a figure in mind what kind of deficit you want Shaktikanta Das I would request everyone to just stick to one question Liquidity is not in deficit The liquidity over the last 2 or 3 weeks went into a deficit mode mainly because of advance tax payments and GST payments So a part of liquidity went as payments for GST and advance tax last month in September Advance tax payment was in the middle of September and the GST payment was around the 20th of September So the liquidity became very tight for those 23 weeks But overall the liquidity is in surplus We have announced the withdrawal of 2000 notes So far we have got back about 343000 crore of which 87 has come back as bank deposits and the rest is through the exchange of cash in other denominations across the counter Now only about 12000 crore are left A substantial amount of liquidity has been built up because of the withdrawal of 2000 notes The taxes came around the 15th20th of last month Government spending has picked up and will pick up further which will also add a lot of liquidity in the system I have also said that in the festival season the demand for currency will go up so the currency in circulation will also go up and that will drain out some amount of liquidity But overall the liquidity is in surplus Thats why I have said that there will be active liquidity management The whole liquidity matrix has several moving parts We will remain watchful and we will undertake whatever operations are required from time to time OMO sales is one which we thought would be required So we have made a mention of it in my statement Thank you Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will request everyone to stick to one question Maybe we can come back for a second question later if time permits Now I will move on to Ms Latha Venkatesh from CNBC TV18 Latha Venkatesh CNBC TV18 I have to stick to OMO again When you say OMO intervention as you say you have not given us an idea whether you will do an OMO auction or screenbased buying and what is the purpose Is it that you want to react to the global yields and therefore some kind of a bulwark What is your trigger Has it got anything to do with the way global yields are one full percentage point higher More generally as the EM Central banker what are your fears and what are your tools when you see such a rise in yields Shaktikanta Das The first point is that this will be done through an auction process and not through the NDSOM platform We will notify it and then we will undertake the operation that is the first part With regard to global bond yields our liquidity management what I have announced and let me reiterate has nothing to do with the global bond yields If you see the statement carefully what we have said is that our liquidity management will be consistent with our monetary policy stance in the context of the overall liquidity situation It has nothing to do with the bond yields going up in the advanced economies What was the other part you asked Latha Venkatesh CNBC TV18 General observation it is the international reserve currency for now and when yields go up there as an EM central banker what are your fears What are your tools Shaktikanta Das You see our domestic bond yields are reacting to domestic factors and not to international factors like the bond yields in some advanced economies Our bond yields are determined primarily by domestic factors as it stands today The bond yields going up elsewhere especially in the United States do normally lead to currency depreciation in the emerging market economies but the difference in the context of India is that our forex reserves are sizable and very comfortable which gives a lot of confidence to the market Secondly we do intervene in the market to maintain the stability of the currency and to prevent excessive volatility So primarily if I can put it differently we use one stone to kill one bird Of course to kill a bird is not the right thing to say in the context of the safety of animals But this is a manner of speaking So I am not saying that we will go and kill a bird So please do not take it any other way especially the animal lovers and the bird lovers among you But on a serious note we use one instrument for one target for one objective When you use an instrument it may have some collateral impact elsewhere so that is how it stands So basically we will use one stone to kill one bird Latha Venkatesh CNBC TV18 Remittances are falling one billion a quarter they are falling Shaktikanta Das Remittances have remained quite robust and steady Temporarily it may happen but our data show that they are holding quite comparable to last year Dr Patra would you like to supplement Michael D Patra The balance of payments for Q1202324 shows a very strong remittance In fact this year might be higher than the year gone by Yogesh Dayal Latha we will move on from here We will come back to you later on Let us now go to Ms Swati Bhat Shetye from Thomson Reuters Swati Bhat Shetye Thomson Reuters Thank you Sir I am going to stick to the liquidity theme Do you think there is a need for the RBI to rework the liquidity framework Under the existing framework the 14day VRRR is the primary option There is no active participation seen or as much adequate participation as the RBI would like Now that is happening you had to use innovative tools like ICRR Now that liquidity is going to remain the key theme and under the current framework the call rate needs to be aligned with the repo rate and you yourself said in todays statement that it is more towards the MSF Is there a need to rethink this framework Are you going to actively pursue anything to bring the call rates and overnight money market rates back to the repo rate Shaktikanta Das I would request DG Michael Patra to reply to that Michael D Patra The liquidity management framework is robust The ICRR was not a reaction to low subscriptions in the regular auctions It was an instrument intended to deal with the special specific occurrence that is the 2000 notes The regular operations are essentially intended to enable banks to maintain their reserve requirement cycles Swati Bhat Shetye Thomson Reuters Getting the overnight rates back to repo is something that you are going to actively pursue because that is required as per the current framework right It needs to be anchored to the repo and we are already close to MSF or you have done an effective rate hike So what Michael D Patra On a daily basis the call money rate is around 675 but if you average it for the month it is 656 which is at the repo Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sirs I will move on to Mr Govardhan Rangan from The Economic Times to ask his question M Govardhan Rangan The Economic Times Good afternoon Governor You actually managed liquidity as and when required You intervened in the currency markets as well and now you spoke about OMO as well So it is a kind of active management of many moving parts since your announcement on OMO and the financial conditions are not as tight as it is in the rest of the world If one looks at the 10year yield gap between the US 10year and 10year Gsec it used to be 500 basis points on average but now it is 222 to 225 bps Is it an impossible trinity kind of a situation the RBI is facing in the sense of trying to manage all three monetary policy exchange rate and capital flows everything Shaktikanta Das As I just replied we use one instrument for one objective one stone for one bird There may be some fallouts There may be some collateral effect elsewhere but primarily we use one instrument for one objective Whatever we are doing for liquidity it is because of the domestic liquidity situation The pressure on the exchange rate due to the dollar index going up etc is managed through market intervention to prevent volatility and as I have said we have enough reserves to manage through That is how it stands Have I answered your question or is there something else M Govardhan Rangan The Economic Times Yes So in terms of the tightness of the financial conditions there is a kind of a difference that used to be there in terms of the advanced markets and the emerging markets and especially in India now it has narrowed quite a bit Is that probably a reason for you to think of OMO at this point in time to tighten the financial conditions and push up the yield rather than just manage the liquidity Shaktikanta Das No it is not yield management The OMO which we have announced is not a yield control or a yield management instrument it is entirely to manage liquidity Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will move on to Ryosuke Hanada from Nikkei Asia Ryosuke Hanada Nikkei Asia Good afternoon Actually last month G20 summit decided to welcome the African Union as a permanent member of the G20 and my question is what do you think of the impact of this decision on the global framework for the discussion especially regarding international discussion of the financial sector Thank you Shaktikanta Das The inclusion of the African Union in the G20 is a very welcome development It goes in line with Indias objective of placing the Voice of Global South on the global table G20 is a multilateral forum and you cannot have a situation where the whole continent is left out of it except South Africa So to that extent the inclusion of the African Union is a very welcome development and now the financial sector issues and other factors relating to Africa will be discussed in G20 Africa now gets a voice in the G20 forum to express the situation in various African countries and to express their priorities and their expectations from a multilateral forum like the G20 This is very much in line with not only Indias priority but it is the international priority to have to listen to the voice of a large continent like Africa Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will move on to Mr Ankur Mishra from ET NOW Ankur Mishra ET NOW Good afternoon Governor You have raised red flags about the personal loans and some of the pockets of personal loans but it is only a warning and no action Is there any action also which is planned meaning in terms of regulations Is there something which the RBI is thinking and where is the problem Is it more of fintech or it is even there in banks and NBFCs as well Shaktikanta Das I have said in my statement that the balance sheet of the financial sector especially the banks and the NBFCs continues to be robust All parameters with regard to banking and NBFCs are better In fact the GNPA figures of the banking sector the unaudited figures which we have now got for the end of June look even better NBFC also are experiencing a similar situation We have to be mindful of what can going forward pose a challenge and what can become a future risk So in certain segments of retail credit we saw high credit growth So it is only to caution the banks to strengthen their internal surveillance systems watch the trends and take whatever measures are required So far as the Reserve Bank is concerned the Reserve Banks Supervision Department monitors it very intensively but the first line of defence is the bank and the NBFCs themselves So it is to sensitise them about the credit growth which is happening and not lull them into any kind of complacency This is in line with what I have been saying over the past few months Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will move on to Mr Benn Jose from PTI Benn Jose PTI Sir this is again on the personal loans which you have flagged If you look at the marketing messages that we get are mostly from the private sector banks and NBFCs your worry is about the banking system as a whole or the private sector and the NBFCs Shaktikanta Das As the regulator for the entire banking system whatever we say is meant for the entire banking system which includes public sector and private sector banks as well as small finance banks It includes various categories of NBFCs also the upper layer the middle layer and the base layer So it is for everyone We do not differentiate between our messaging among which sector the banks belong to Wherever individual bankrelated issues are involved our supervisors normally engage with them directly Benn Jose PTI The problem is more among the private sector banks internally what is the rationale for the warning so public warning during the policy Shaktikanta Das We are only sensitising them that you have to be careful It is not because some problem is already there You have to keep your eyes and ears open and your nose also open You have to smell where the crisis is likely to come up At the moment the banking and the NBFC sector are stable Mr Swaminathan is there anything you would like to add Shri Swaminathan J Just to supplement that if you look at the last couple of years the yearonyear average growth on retail credit has been close to 30 in most institutions and secured retail credit has grown at 23 If you see that in the context of the rest of the credit growth which is in the range of 1214 it looks to be an outlier So as a supervisor it is our intention to inform the banks that this is an outlier level of growth So strengthen your internal surveillance mechanisms so that any risk that may likely be building up is handled upfront rather than coming to grief at a later time also because of the ability to learn through digital modes this particular segment is showing a far greater growth compared to others So we are mindful of that in terms of the opportunity and the ability to the ease and convenience that have been brought through the digital mediums As the Governor said when we see any outliers they are reached out separately This is a general systemlevel advisory so that the banks and NBFCs and all the players strengthen their internal measures put internal prudential framework have their risk appetite framework and grow their portfolio sensibly So that is the intention at this point in time Benn Jose PTI No need for provisions or risk weights Shri Swaminathan J We have not announced any regulatory measures or macroprudential measures at this point in time We would expect as a first line of defence the banks and NBFCs and the fintechs to take appropriate internal controls In case we do not see internal controls playing out then we will examine but at this point in time it is only an advisory Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sirs I will move on to Mr Jeevan Bhavsar from All India Radio Jeevan Bhavsar All India Radio Due to different irregularities by some banks RBI cancels the licenses of those banks and it creates havoc within the account holders of the banks Though in many cases we have seen that more than 95 of the account holders get all their money back from DICGC this sudden cancelling of the license creates a panic and havoc in the minds of account holders Do we have any such system or are we going to propose any such systems through which we can inform our banks account holders in advance Shaktikanta Das DG Rajeshwar Rao can take that question M Rajeshwar Rao This decision is not taken suddenly As we have said the cancellation of the UCB license is not a sudden event Banks are placed under a supervisory action framework for corrective action if they fail to meet certain prudential thresholds or financial thresholds If that does not fail they are placed under an allinclusive direction and the bank is monitored closely to ensure that they are able to come out of the financial problems that they are facing It is only when these measures do not take place that a decision is taken to cancel their license So it is not an event but there is sufficient time given in the entire process for the banks to rehabilitate themselves through various measures Jeevan Bhavsar All India Radio But Sir the thing is that the common account holders get to know these things very late when the RBI cancels the license So if we have any such system or any such proposals so that we can send some alerts to the common bank account holders M Rajeshwar Rao When we put the bank in an allinclusive direction then we issue a press note so whatever important warnings the accounts holders get from that Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will move on to Mr Lalatendu Mishra from the Hindu Lalatendu Mishra The Hindu Good afternoon Governor You have said the Government is stepping up spending and is also likely to step up further In the last two or three years the Government has been spending heavily that is supporting the growth I would like to know the state of the financial health of the Government as a banker to the Government are you satisfied are you comfortable Shaktikanta Das The first thing is it is not for me to comment on that but since you have asked our perception as a banker to the Government let me say that the Government has a fiscal consolidation path which they have announced in the budget There was fiscal expansion because of the COVID time requirement but the overall expansion that India did under the fiscal was wellcalibrated and targeted After the pandemic the Government announced a fiscal consolidation roadmap and by and large they are sticking to that Even recently so far as the current years fiscal deficit is concerned a statement has been made by the Finance Ministry that the Government will stick to the fiscal deficit and they are targeting this fiscal consolidation roadmap So far as the Central Government finances are concerned I do not see any major problem or anything that worries the Central Bank Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will now move on to Zee Business Ms Swati Khandelwal Swati Khandelwal Zee Business Thank you Governor My question is that you recently commented on corporate governance about the gaps in the banks From that point of view the banks were given a statement in that have you seen some improvement Any specific measures you are taking against those who are not following what is your view on that Shaktikanta Das At any point of time there is a scope for improvement in any institution I would like to tell you that the Reserve Bank has taken a series of measures for banks and NBFCs in the last few years after the review of asset quality like guidelines on bank governance in 2021 new regulatory framework for NBFC and for microfinance All these have raised awareness in the institutions about the importance of risk management governance etc As of now the banks are far more sensitive with regard to risk management and other areas which form part of governance namely risk management compliance and even internal audit There are a lot of improvements in that and in future we have to finetune it and also improve it Wherever we see deficiencies the Reserve Bank points out to the institutions through supervisors that in this area you need improvement Otherwise overall the governance standards consisting of the risk management the compliance culture the internal audit and the sensitivity to maintain a robust balance sheet have improved But you have to improve further and that applies to everyone in every situation Yogesh Dayal Sir we will now move on to Mr Anand Adhikari from Business Today Anand Adhikari Business Today Good afternoon Sir I was looking at some of the external data points since the last policy in August So now if you look at the 10year US yield it is almost 20 to 25 up I mean almost 100 basis points like Latha said The US dollar index is strengthening and is almost 6 to 7 up since the August policy Crude we all have seen the high volatility though yesterday it was down If I look at the impact on the Indian parameters like the Rupee It has depreciated around 50 paise since the last August policy foreign exchange reserves are down by US1314 billion since the last policy The FII has witnessed an outflow in September and October Now in the context of liquidity you said that it is a turning pitch and you want to play your shots very carefully How would you describe this external side or maybe in cricketing parlance if I say Michael D Patra As the Governor has mentioned we have very strong buffers in the foreign exchange reserves which insulate our economy from global spillovers that you mentioned As you can see our bond markets react to local specific phenomena in India and seem to be reasonably insulated from the yields in the advanced economies If you look at our external indicators the current account deficit is extremely modest at 1 of GDP in Q1202324 and within 2 of GDP in FY 202223 The fact is that the whole current account deficit is more than comfortably financed and that is why we build reserves If you see the movements in the reserves they are more or less due to valuation changes rather than durable decline If you knock out the valuation changes as we do in the balance of payments you will see there is an increase of US24 billion in a quarter You look at the BOP there you can see the improvement Shaktikanta Das It is also in my statement that on a BOP basis the net accretion to our reserves is US244 billion in Q1202324 Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will move on to Mr Sachin Kumar from the Financial Express Sachin Kumar The Financial Express Good afternoon Sir You mentioned about skewed liquidity situation where some banks are parking some banks are borrowing So do you see a need to take some steps to bring more uniformity to the banks response Shaktikanta Das We would not like to do micromanagement of liquidity in Individual banks It is for the banks to assess their liquidity requirements and manage them in the most efficient manner possible We have observed this and just sensitised the banks We have voiced our view to the banks Now it is for the banks to take a cue and act upon that I do expect the banks will take the signal and act appropriately Sachin Kumar The Financial Express Some banks are asking for an extension of call market hours exactly for this Shaktikanta Das We will come to that later Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir We will move on to Ms Gopika Gopakumar from Mint Gopika Gopakumar Mint Just one extension to his question are there fewer banks which are parking funds under SDF is there a monopoly is there a need for looking at a general policy because fewer banks are now parking funds under SDF that is a question largely in the market The second is that recently we saw a Fintech Slice has been merged with a small finance bank Whether the Reserve Banks outlook on giving banking licenses to fintechs now undergone a change Shaktikanta Das On the Fintech and the license part I would request DG Rajeshwar Rao to reply But there is no monopoly that it is only one or two banks who are doing Todays position is that all banks put together have borrowed 80000 crore under MSF and in the SDF the deposit is 56000 crore It is spread across banks linked to their size A large bank will obviously have a greater share in both these numbers With regard to Fintech that small finance bank issue DG Rajeshwar Rao can reply M Rajeshwar Rao What is envisaged is not a merger which has been approved We have given a No Objection Certificate for a proposal by one of the NBFCs to merge with a SFB which is a longdrawn process and happens under the aegis of the NCLT We have not taken any change in our approach as far as the fintechs are concerned As far as approval for a banking license or a proposal for voluntary amalgamation is concerned we do carry out a fit and proper assessment of the thing the financials involved and the future setup of the bank or the merged entities and take a call accordingly So there has been no change in the approach Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sirs I will move on to Mr Hitesh Vyas from The Indian Express Hitesh Vyas The Indian Express You have extended the timeline to deposit or exchange 2000 notes till October 7 Do you expect the 4 or 14000 crore to come back in the system by tomorrow Shaktikanta Das No it can be deposited or exchanged thereafter in Issue Offices of the Reserve Bank which is there in almost in every State capital There is also the facility of sending these 2000 notes through the Postal Department to the Reserve Bank because supposing you are away from the State headquarters and you cannot travel you can send them So the facility continues with the Reserve Bank The bulk of it as you have seen has come back and it has largely met our original objective of the withdrawal of 2000 notes The process now is with the banks till tomorrow and then thereafter with the Issue Offices Rabi do you want to add anything T Rabi Sankar A large part has already been received as you have said Some portions will be stuck in legal cases or with enforcement agencies and so on That will take its own course To the extent that a large part has already been done and as the Governor said as we have given time even after October 7 for withdrawal through the RBI Issue Offices we expect that most of it will be withdrawn when the process is complete Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will move on to Mr Vishwanath Nair from BQ Prime Vishwanath Nair BQ Prime Good afternoon Governor two parts again First on the Rupee it seems that RBI is very keen on defending it every time it reaches that record low I do not understand because it is a global issue the global conditions have changed and that is probably why the Rupee is weakening against the US dollar But then why does the RBI keep defending that record low The other part is on the household financial savings numbers that came out FY 202223 has seen about a 50year low number Considering your comments on retail loans are you seeing excessive leverage building up within the household sector Shaktikanta Das With regard to the household savings there are several nuances and I would request DG Michael Patra to take that question On the other part of your question about the Rupee let me reiterate what we have been saying that we do not have any specific level of the exchange rate Our objective and market intervention is to prevent excessive volatility and to see that there is orderly appreciation or orderly depreciation We do not have any specific level It is not a question of defending a particular level of Rupee That policy of the Reserve Bank is a timetested established policy which we are adhering to Regarding household financial savings I want to say that there are several nuances of this whole thing so please take note of the points that the DG Dr Patra is going to explain Michael D Patra As I mentioned the historical average is about 75 of GDP Now we saw in the pandemic that because people could not go out to spend there were movement restrictions and also there was stimulus into the economy the people built up what I called precautionary saving so they rose up to 11 Now as these movement restrictions were removed people went out to spend and they started to draw down those precautionary savings That is some of the phenomena that we have seen now But if you see the absolute level of savings it has gone up by 14 in 202223 Further within the quarterly numbers there is an increase from 42 in the first quarter to 7 in the last quarter So it is already going towards the trend The other important thing is that there has been an increase in the financial liabilities of households If you see where these liabilities are going they are mostly going to housing So what are houses doing they are shifting from financial savings to physical savings When they do that they actually add to their investment The physical part of savings goes straight into investment So in the next year you will see investment picking up Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sirs I will move on to Mr Manish Suvarna from Moneycontrol Manish Suvarna Moneycontrol Thank you Yogesh sir good afternoon Governor Sir In the Monetary Policy Report you said the inflation forecast for FY 202425 is 45 and inflation is seen averaging 43 in the last quarter of that year So is a sub4 quarterly forecast necessary for the MPC to lower the repo rate Michael D Patra The MPC has said that they are focused on aligning the inflation outcomes with a target So a tendency of the inflation numbers to move towards 4 is what we are looking for If it goes below 4 on a durable basis then we will shift to accommodation We are trying to keep inflation at the target or around it Shaktikanta Das That is why we have used the word align the inflation to the 4 target If there is a sudden spike or if there is a sudden fall we have to see how durable is that decline Only when we are convinced that there is durability in what do you call the inflation is at 4 or below 4 that may call for a rethink but not at the moment Swati Bhat Shetye Thomson Reuters Sir the question was you gave us the next four quarters so do you mean a 4 figure to appear in that forecast for you to consider it Shaktikanta Das That was replied to isnt it I cannot tell you what is the specific point if it reaches 425 or 426 then we will take a call People have asked this question to withdraw of accommodation neutral and all that The question of neutrality will arise when you see inflation at around 4 on a durable basis Neutral would mean that you can act in both directions When it goes below 4 again on a sustainable level when we are convinced that it has come below 4 and is likely to be sustained at that level then that could be a ground for a rethink I am saying ground for a rethink I am not going to say that we will cut 12 months down the road or so many months down the road because let us also accept that there have been multiple and overlapping shocks and the global scenario also remains highly uncertain For the whole of the last week or two weeks the crude prices were US9095 per barrel but since yesterday it has come down There are big surprises coming from food price shocks there are weather events So given that kind of a highly uncertain environment it will not be desirable for the central bank to say that I will do this at this particular time because it will unnecessarily confuse the market and it may not actually play out that way because of the uncertainties involved Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sirs I will take the last two questions one is from Mr Pankaj Aher from Informist Media Pankaj Aher Informist Media Governor sir actually the RBI has done a very commendable job of controlling inflation without affecting growth This is more pronounced when one looks at the global scenario for both advanced countries as well as developing countries When do you expect inflation will come down to a 4 target that RBI has on a durable basis Shaktikanta Das In the monetary policy report we have given our current projections which is how we see the situation playing out in next year for this year we have given it in my statement and in the MPCs resolution So that is how we expect it to play out but there can be developments that can result in uncertainties on both sides We have seen it in the past when certain prices especially with regard to vegetables and all have suddenly crashed nobody had expected it at that time So there are uncertainties and such uncertainties can work both ways So given that uncertainty at the moment our position is that the path which we have given in the MPR we expect it to play out accordingly Pankaj Aher Informist Media You also spoke in the policy about the core inflation declining is there a number you have in mind to which core inflation should further go down for inflation expectation to be anchored around the target of 4 Michael D Patra No our target is headline inflation Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir With this we will come to the last question I will request Ms Shyama Mishra from Doordarshan to ask her question Shyama Mishra Doordarshan Sir you have been highlighting sudden food shocks these words a lot Amidst the festive season when a common man is ready to spend how do you see this policy be translated for him for a common person Shaktikanta Das The first thing is that we have not increased the rates The second thing is that our focus is to bring down inflation When we control and bring down inflation we are actually increasing the purchasing power in the hands of the people The third point I would like to mention is that when we make policy we are very sensitive to 140 crore people in the country Monetary policy is not just for some segments of the financial market We are very sensitive and mindful of the requirements of around 140 crore people who are in this country A mention was made about RBI supporting growth when it was required even now the growth continues to be resilient So our policy is not just for the financial markets alone our policy is for 140 crore people and I have explained how it is likely to benefit When inflation comes down naturally the common man benefits the most so that is how I would like to put it Hamsini Karthik The Hindu Business Line My question was on the pricing of bank loans On the new loans front banks are not aggressively passing on the rate cuts that have happened so far Much of the transmission is still on the existing pool On the deposit side we are seeing that the pricing is very aggressive especially in the lower end of the basket which is 1to3year deposits The deployment again on the lending is largely towards all pockets of personal loans This sort of difference in pricing has your stress test so far revealed that there could be a possibility in some sort of a pricing mismatch or a problem in aligning rates possibly in the medium term Is that a risk that you are looking at right now Shaktikanta Das DG Swaminathan can take that question Swaminathan J As the Governor also alluded to the transmission has not fully played out as we see from the numbers that come to us The weighted average lending rate on the existing loans on a portfolio basis as well as new loans and the weighted average deposit rates for new deposits are periodically published So we keep monitoring this What we will have to understand is that this will be bankspecific in terms of their own business appetite and their ability to attract deposits to the extent that they command a retail franchise So the expectation that all banks will have a similar movement in terms of lending rates or deposit rates in a freemarket situation is not realistic As a central bank we are only watching to what extent they are getting transmitted so that the desired effect in terms of our inflation targeting and the tightening of the regulatory framework is at play We do not want to individually prescribe in terms of what should be the lending or deposit rate Shaktikanta Das It is for the bank management to deal with these issues RBI would not and should not get into those areas We highlight at the sectoral level what is desirable Now having said that there was a point made about remittances that they are declining DG Michael Patra has the numbers you can mention that Michael D Patra Latha you are making the error of comparing Q1 to Q4 that is not the way You should compare Q1 to Q1 because there is a seasonality in remittances and there is an increase Latha Venkatesh CNBC TV There was a question on the timing of the call money market and NEFT Shaktikanta Das That request has come from various quarters NEFT and RTGS are round the clock now 24x7 and the reporting time is 2359 We have also instituted an ASISO auto sweepin and swipeout facility Some institutions and some banks have expressed certain operational difficulties we are looking into that If something is decided we will announce it Yogesh Dayal Latha please allow me to thank all of you for being here So with this I thank the top management of the Reserve Bank led by the respected Governor Deputy Governors and Executive Directors Thank you all friends for a very cordial press conference And thanks to top management for patiently answering even the extended questions as well So all the best Thank you and Seasons Greetings to all of you Thank you

measures relating to i Regulation ii Payments Systems and iii Consumer Protection I Regulation 1 Prudential Framework for Income Recognition Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to Advances Projects Under Implementation Project finance is generally characterized by various complexities inter alia including long gestation periods With a view to strengthen the extant regulatory framework governing the project finance and to harmonise the instructions across all regulated entities the extant prudential norms for projects under implementation have been reviewed and a comprehensive regulatory framework applicable for all regulated entities is proposed to be issued Detailed draft guidelines on the above will be issued separately 2 Credit Concentration Norms Credit Risk Transfer The extant guidelines on Large Exposure Framework for NonBanking Financial Company Upper Layer NBFCUL permits exposures to the original counterparty to be offset with certain credit risk transfer instruments However the extant credit concentration norms for NBFC in the Middle Layer ML and Base Layer BL do not explicitly envisage any such mechanism With a view to harmonize the aforesaid norms among NBFCs it has been decided to permit NBFCs in the ML and BL as well to offset their exposures with eligible credit risk transfer instruments The instructions in this regard shall be issued shortly 3 Gold Loan Bullet Repayment Scheme UCBs UCBs have been permitted an extended glide path for achievement of PSL targets beyond March 2023 With a view to incentivising UCBs that have met the prescribed PSL targets as on March 31 2023 it has been decided to increase the monetary ceiling of gold loans that can be granted under the bullet repayment scheme from 200 lakh to 400 lakh for such UCBs who have met the overall PSL target and sub targets as on March 31 2023 These banks will be required to continue to meet the targets and subtargets thereafter Detailed guidelines on the matter will be issued separately Incidentally in terms of our circular DORCREREC180710002202324 dated June 8 2023 granting extension of time for achieving the Priority sector lending targets it was clarified that incentives to UCBs meeting the PSL targets shall be announced separately 4 Framework for recognition of SROs for Regulated Entities REs of Reserve Bank In view of the potential role of SelfRegulatory Organisations SROs in strengthening compliance culture among their members and also providing a consultative platform for policy making it has been decided to issue an omnibus framework for recognising SROs for various Regulated Entities REs of the Reserve Bank The omnibus SRO framework shall prescribe the broad objectives functions eligibility criteria governance standards etc which will be common for all SROs irrespective of the sector The Reserve Bank may prescribe sectorspecific additional conditions at the time of calling for applications for recognising such SROs To begin with a draft of the omnibus framework will be released for stakeholder comments II Payments Systems 5 Payments Infrastructure Development Fund Extension of Scheme and Inclusion of PM Vishwakarma Scheme beneficiaries The Payments Infrastructure Development Fund PIDF Scheme was operationalised by the Reserve Bank in January 2021 for a period of three years The objective was to incentivise the deployment of payment acceptance infrastructure such as physical Point of Sale PoS Quick Response QR codes in tier3 to tier6 centres north eastern states and Union Territories of Jammu Kashmir and Ladakh Beneficiaries of PM SVANidhi Scheme in Tier1 and 2 centres were later included in August 2021 As at endAugust 2023 over 266 crore new touch points have been deployed under the Scheme It is now proposed to extend the PIDF Scheme by a further period of two years ie upto December 31 2025 Also it is proposed to include beneficiaries of PM Vishwakarma Scheme in all centres under the PIDF Scheme This decision to expand the targeted beneficiaries under the PIDF scheme will provide fillip to the Reserve Banks efforts towards promoting digital transactions at the grassroots level Further based on the feedback received from industry deployment of emerging modes of payment acceptance such as soundbox devices and Aadhaarenabled biometric devices are proposed to be encouraged under the PIDF Scheme This is expected to further accelerate and augment the deployment of payment acceptance infrastructure in the targeted geographies The amendments will be notified shortly 6 Introducing new channels for CardonFile Tokenisation RBI introduced CardonFile Tokenisation CoFT in September 2021 and began implementation from October 1 2022 So far over 56 crore tokens have been created on which transactions with value of over 5 lakh crore have been undertaken Tokenisation has improved transaction security and transaction approval rate At present CardonFileCoF token can only be created through merchants application or webpage It is now proposed to introduce CoF token creation facilities directly at the issuer bank level This measure will enhance convenience for cardholders to get tokens created and linked to their existing accounts with various ecommerce applications Instructions in this regard will be issued separately III Consumer Protection 7 Master Direction on Internal Ombudsman mechanism in Regulated Entities The Reserve Bank of India in 2015 introduced an Internal Ombudsman IO mechanism in select scheduled commercial banks with the objective to strengthen their Internal Grievance Redress IGR system and to ensure efficient and fair resolution of customer complaints by enabling an apex level review within the banks before their rejection Gradually the framework has been extended to other regulated entities REs viz select NonBank System Participants nonbank issuers of PPIs select NonBanking Financial Companies and all Credit Information Companies The guidelines on Internal Ombudsman framework currently in operation for various categories of REs have similar design features but carry certain variations on operational matters Based on the learnings from the implementation of the extant IO guidelines it has been decided to harmonise the same and issue a consolidated Master Direction The Master Direction shall bring uniformity in matters like timeline for escalation of complaints to IOs exclusions temporary absence of the Internal Ombudsman minimum qualifications for appointing an Internal Ombudsman and updation of reporting formats in addition to introduction of the post of Deputy Internal Ombudsman These instructions are expected to further strengthen the IO mechanism and in turn the grievance redress system in REs Yogesh Dayal

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=22050,Date Monetary Policy Report October 2023,I Macroeconomic Outlook The outlook for domestic economic activity remains resilient in spite of large supply shocks that have pushed up the trajectory of headline inflation Energy and food price volatility geopolitical hostilities tightening external financial conditions and climate shocks are the key risks to the outlook Monetary policy remains focused on aligning inflation with the target to pave the path for sustained growth in the mediumterm I1 Key Developments since the April 2023 MPR Global economic activity and trade are slowing although unevenly across geographies and sectors Tightening financial conditions in response to monetary actions to address still elevated inflation persisting geopolitical tensions and growing geoeconomic fragmentation render the outlook fragile Manufacturing activity is contracting across many countries while services are relatively resilient Headline inflation has been gradually easing across the world however in most countries it remains elevated in relation to targets Core inflation is moderating but at a tardy pace and services inflation is sticky These concerns are reflected in higher for longer monetary policy settings In some countries however the monetary policy tightening cycle is complete or nearing it or even in accommodation in response to weakening economic activity Market expectations relating to the global economic outlook are fluctuating widely and sensitive to every incoming information imparting high volatility In September US sovereign bond yields touched their highest levels since the global financial crisis and the yield curve has seen its longest period of inversion since 1980 Credit growth in major economies is decelerating in response to monetary tightening After strong gains in the first half of 2023 global equity markets retreated in Q3 JulySeptember The US dollar depreciated to a 15month low in midJuly but has recovered subsequently on betterthanexpected US economic data Crude oil prices firmed up sharply to around US 95 per barrel in September in response to extended output cuts by key producing countries Food prices are volatile on supply concerns arising from the breakdown of the Black Sea deal on Ukrainian grain movements and the El Nio weather phenomenon Turning to the domestic economy activity was supported in H1202324 by private consumption and fixed investment although adverse external conditions are being reflected in a prolonged contraction in net exports Real gross domestic product GDP rose by 78 per cent yearonyear yoy in Q1202324 AprilJune and high frequency indicators for Q2 suggest that the momentum in activity is being maintained On the supply side real gross value added GVA is being buoyed by services sector growth Headline CPI inflation had moderated from an average of 67 per cent in 202223 to 43 per cent in May 2023 in response to monetary policy actions and supply side measures Reversing these gains under the impact of sporadic food supply shocks inflation jumped to 74 per cent in July and 68 per cent in August On the other hand core inflation ie CPI excluding food and fuel has been gradually ebbing down to sub5 per cent levels With the cumulative rate hike of 250 basis points bps undertaken during May 2022February 2023 working its way into the economy the monetary policy committee MPC kept the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent through H1 and it remains firmly committed to aligning inflation with the target going forward Monetary Policy Committee April 2023 September 2023 When the MPC met in April 2023 the global economy was going through a period of heightened volatility in the wake of banking sector turmoil in some advanced economies AEs Domestic CPI headline inflation was ruling above the upper threshold of the tolerance band in January and February but was expected to soften with a record rabi foodgrains production easing input cost conditions and normalisation of supply chain pressures CPI inflation was projected at 52 per cent for 202324 10 bps lower than the February projection Domestic economic activity was seen to be holding up well and the real GDP growth projection for 202324 was raised to 65 per cent from 64 per cent in the February meeting Considering these factors and that previous rate hikes were still working through the system the MPC unanimously decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent but with a readiness to act should the situation so warrant The MPC decided by a majority of 51 to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth At the time of the June 2023 meeting CPI headline inflation had fallen to 47 per cent April 2023 print from an average of 62 per cent during the previous quarter The MPC noted that the moderation in CPI headline inflation reflected the combined and continuing impact of monetary policy tightening supply augmenting measures and the fuller impact of the previous rate hikes which should keep inflationary pressures contained in the coming months Against this backdrop the MPC unanimously voted again to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent and with a 51 vote to continue with its stance of withdrawal of accommodation In the run up to the August 2023 meeting headline CPI inflation picked up to 48 per cent in June with sizeable upside pressures on the nearterm headline inflation trajectory from a spike in vegetable prices Factoring in the skewed southwest monsoon outturn the growing likelihood of an El Nio event and the worsening global food prices outlook the inflation projection for 202324 was revised upwards by 30 bps to 54 per cent while the April 2023 projection for real GDP was kept unchanged Taking into account the cumulative policy repo rate increase undertaken thus far the MPC unanimously decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent with preparedness to undertake policy responses With a 5 to 1 vote the MPC reiterated its stance of withdrawal of accommodation The MPCs voting pattern reflects the diversity in individual members assessments expectations and policy preferences a characteristic also reflected in voting patterns of other central banks Table I1 Macroeconomic Outlook Chapters II and III analyse macroeconomic developments relating to inflation and economic activity during H1202324 AprilSeptember 2023 Turning to the baseline assumptions first international crude prices have exhibited sizeable twoway movements in H1 easing in April amidst a banking crisis in the US and underwhelming Chinese recovery but they moved higher beginning July with Brent crude crossing US dollar US 90 per barrel in September due to production cuts referred to earlier with some correction in early October Geopolitical tensions impart significant uncertainty to the outlook Chart I1a and Chart I1b The crack spread the wedge between global petroleum product prices and crude prices is elevated in view of demandsupply refinery mismatches Chart I1c Taking into account these developments the baseline assumption for crude price Indian basket is retained at US 85 per barrel Table I2 Second the nominal exchange rate of the Indian rupee or INR has moved in both directions around the April baseline varying in a range of INR 817833 per US in H1 Taking into consideration the uncertainty around US dollar movements the ebbs and flows of global capital and international crude oil prices the baseline assumption for the exchange rate is revised to INR 825 per US dollar Third multiple headwinds tighter monetary and fiscal policies reduced pentup demand financial stability risks continued geopolitical challenges and geoeconomic fragmentation weigh heavily on global growth prospects The global purchasing managers index PMI for manufacturing has remained in contraction mode since September 2022 while the services PMI is moderating since May 2023 albeit still in expansion mode In its July 2023 update of the World Economic Outlook WEO the International Monetary Fund IMF revised its global growth forecast for 2023 marginally upwards to 30 per cent from its April projection of 28 per cent Chart I2 Yet global GDP growth for 2023 and 2024 30 per cent each will trail its 2022 level 35 per cent as well as its historical 200019 average of 38 per cent Global trade growth goods and services combined is projected by the IMF to decelerate from 52 per cent in 2022 to 20 per cent in 2023 I2 The Outlook for Inflation Looking ahead the sharp spike in food prices especially of vegetables has started correcting Chapter II The three months and one year ahead median inflation expectations of urban households fell by 90 and 40 bps respectively to 91 per cent and 99 per cent in the September 2023 round of the Reserve Banks survey1 visvis the previous round Notably inflation expectations fell to a single digit for the first time since the COVID19 pandemic The proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate declined considerably for both the horizons visvis the previous round Chart I3 Manufacturing firms polled in the JulySeptember 2023 round of the Reserve Banks industrial outlook survey expect increased pressures from the cost of raw materials but marginal decline in selling price growth in Q3202324 Chart I4a2 Services and infrastructure firms expect lower growth in input cost and selling prices in Q3202324 Charts I4b and I4c3 In the PMI surveys for September 2023 manufacturing firms reported a decline in input cost inflation but an increase in output price inflation services firms reported moderation in both input and output price pressures Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank in September 2023 expect headline CPI inflation to moderate from 66 per cent in Q2202324 to 55 per cent in Q3 51 per cent in Q4 and 5240 per cent in H1202425 Chart I5a and Table I34 Core inflation ie CPI excluding food and beverages pan tobacco and intoxicants and fuel and light expectation was seen at 49 per cent in Q2202324 47 per cent in Q3 46 per cent in Q4 and 4647 per cent in H1202425 Longrun inflation expectations of professional forecasters measured by their 5year ahead expectations softened to 49 per cent while 10year ahead expectations remained unchanged at 45 per cent Chart I5b Looking ahead the outlook for inflation will be conditioned heavily by food inflation dynamics The southwest monsoon rainfall has been uneven with August recording a 36 per cent deficiency in rainfall Water reservoir levels have dipped and El Nio conditions are taking hold although the Indian Ocean Dipole IOD has turned positive which could limit El Nio effects Kharif sowing has exceeded last years levels but with shortfalls in area under pulses and oilseeds Global supply chains are improving from their pandemic disruptions Geopolitical hostilities pose upside risks to global commodity prices across the board food crude oil and metals Taking into account the initial conditions signals from forwardlooking surveys and estimates from timeseries and structural models5 CPI inflation is projected to average 54 per cent in 202324 64 per cent in Q2 56 per cent in Q3 and 52 per cent in Q4 with risks evenly balanced Chart I6 The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for headline inflation in Q4202324 are 4163 per cent and 3569 per cent respectively For 202425 assuming a normal monsoon and no further exogenous or policy shocks structural model estimates indicate that inflation will average 45 per cent in a range of 3852 per cent In Q4202425 CPI inflation is projected at 43 per cent with the 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals at 3056 per cent and 2363 per cent respectively The baseline forecasts are subject to several upside and downside risks The upside risks emanate from more persistent food price increases due to weatherrelated disturbances which could then feed into inflation expectations further hardening of global commodity prices amidst an escalation of geopolitical tensions and a larger passthrough of input cost pressures to output prices The downside risks could emanate from an early resolution of geopolitical tensions a steep correction in global crude and commodity prices in the event of a sharp slowdown in the global growth and further improvement in supply conditions Monetary policy communication has emerged as an important tool for managing and anchoring expectations and strengthening monetary transmission in an environment of heightened uncertainty A textual analysis of the Reserve Banks MPRs shows that their tone has been in consonance with the evolving price and output developments which strengthens the monetary policy communication channel Box I1 Box I1 Monetary Policy Reports as a Communication Tool Textual Analysis Central banks communicate through a variety of channels monetary policy statements speeches press conferences minutes testimonies and monetary policy or inflation reports A growing literature is undertaking a quantitative textual analysis of these documents especially monetary policy reports MPRs to assess the communication tone Cherry and Tong 2023 A textual analysis of the Reserve Banks 15 MPRs Chapters 13 since April 2016 is undertaken by using a predetermined list of positive and negative words Loughran and McDonald 2011 The quantitative estimate of MPRs tone and subjectivity is obtained by estimating two parameters Polarity Ratio6 and Subjectivity Ratio7 where Positivet and Negativet are the number of words matched with the predetermined list in each report and Nt is the total number of words used Communication can be more effective if it is easily understood by the general public For this the readability of the MPRs is checked using FleschKincaid FK Grade Level and GunningFog FOG indices Ferrara and Angino 2022 The scores provided by these indices can be interpreted as the number of years of education required to understand a text The higher the score the greater the complexity of the language used The tone of the MPRs as seen from the polarity score is within the neutral range 05 to 05 and has moved in line with the evolving price and output developments Chart I11 The MPR has turned more objective over time as indicated by the downward sloping subjectivity index According to the readability indices the MPRs require at least a high school education for understanding9 them notwithstanding some recent improvement References Cherry R and Tong E 2023 Words of RBNZ Textual Analysis of Monetary

agricultural performance sustained buoyancy in contactintensive services the boost to investment from the governments thrust on capital expenditure above trend capacity utilisation in manufacturing double digit credit growth and healthier corporate and bank balance sheets Slowing global growth the drag from exports geopolitical risks and volatile global financial conditions however weigh heavily on the outlook Turning to the key messages from forwardlooking surveys consumer confidence the current situation index has improved in the September 2023 survey round visvis the previous round on account of better perceptions on the general economic and employment situation Consumers optimism for the year ahead measured by the future expectations index remains upbeat on improved expectations about the general economic situation employment and income conditions Chart I710 In the Reserve Banks industrial outlook survey of JulySeptember 2023 manufacturing firms are optimistic about demand conditions in Q3202324 Chart I8a While the optimism of services sector companies waned in Q3 visvis the previous round infrastructure sector companies remain upbeat in terms of the overall business situation Charts I8b and I8c Recent surveys by other agencies signal a mixed picture on business expectations relative to the previous round Table I4 Manufacturing and services firms in the PMI surveys for September 2023 exhibited optimism for the year ahead The professional forecasters polled in the September 2023 round of the Reserve Banks survey expect real GDP growth at 63 per cent in Q2202324 58 per cent in Q3 54 per cent in Q4 and 6064 per cent in H1202425 Chart I9 Taking into account the baseline assumptions survey indicators and model forecasts real GDP growth is expected at 65 per cent in 202324 65 per cent in Q2 60 per cent in Q3 and 57 per cent in Q4 with risks evenly balanced around this baseline path Chart I10 and Table I3 For 202425 assuming a normal monsoon and no major exogenous or policy shocks structural model estimates indicate real GDP growth at 65 per cent with quarterly growth rates in the range of 6366 per cent There are upside and downside risks to this baseline growth path The upside risks emanate from a strongerthanexpected rebound in contactintensive services some of which have still to catch up to their prepandemic levels a more vigorous boost to private investment from governments capex push and healthier corporate balance sheets more resilient global growth and an early resolution of the geopolitical conflict On the contrary an escalation in geopolitical tensions a further hardening of international crude oil food and commodity prices a sharper loss of momentum in global trade and demand and frequent weatherrelated disturbances due to climate change pose downside risks to the baseline growth path I4 Balance of Risks The projections of growth and inflation presented in this chapter are contingent upon the baseline assumptions set out in Table I2 These assumptions remain subject to a range of uncertainties as elucidated earlier Against this backdrop this section explores plausible alternative scenarios to assess the balance of risks to the baseline projections i Global Growth Uncertainties Global growth is slowing after a relatively strong outturn in H12023 There are downside risks to the baseline assumption from the elevated inflation trajectory in major economies an extended phase of tight financial conditions from expectations of interest rates remaining elevated over a prolonged horizon protracted geopolitical hostilities supply chain fragmentations and substantive slowdown in China Global inflation though moderating remains hostage to the risk of a wageprice spiral owing to tight labour markets in several AEs There is a strong common global component in headline and core inflation across countries Box I2 which could exert sustained upward inflation pressures and necessitate further monetary tightening which in turn could weigh down on output In such a scenario if global growth is 100 bps lower than the baseline domestic growth and inflation could be around 30 bps and 15 bps respectively below their baseline trajectories Conversely if inflation in major economies retreats faster than anticipated geopolitical tensions ebb and the stimuli measures are able to reverse the slowdown in the Chinese economy quickly global growth may remain resilient In this scenario if global growth is higher by 50 bps domestic growth and inflation could edge higher by around 15 bps and 7 bps respectively Charts I11a and I12a Box I2 Inflation Comovements and Idiosyncrasies A CrossCountry Analysis The sharp rise in global commodity prices the widespread supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine and strong demand due to large monetary and fiscal stimulus led to an upsurge in inflation across geographies in 2022 Chart I21a and b Structural factors such as movements in international trade and financial flows and more integrated supply chains added to the synchronisation of inflation Ha et al 2019 To empirically assess the role of such global common factors a Generalised Dynamic Factor Model GDFM is estimated for headline as well as core inflation for a sample of 26 countries11 including both AEs and emerging market economies EMEs for the period January 2012May 2023 Equation 1 below where it is headline or core inflation of country i at time t the multiplicative term biLft represents the common component whereas it is the idiosyncratic ie countryspecific component of inflation The common component captures the impact of a common global shock or factor ft on countrylevel inflation filtered through country loadings represented by the lag polynomial biL Forni et al 2000 The global component is the weighted average of the common component of the sample economies with the weights being their respective shares in the aggregate GDP at market exchange rates The empirical analysis indicates that the share of the global component12 in the variance of inflation is i higher for AEs than EMEs both for headline and core on the one hand and ii higher for headline than core inflation on the other Chart I22 a and b Thus the comovement in inflation is stronger in AEs relative to EMEs and in headline inflation relative to core The share of variance explained by the global common factor for core inflation was muted in the prepandemic period but has surged in the pandemic phase and remains elevated A deep dive into the potential determinants shows that the global component is highly persistent and driven by international crude prices global food inflation and US dollar appreciation for headline as well as core inflation and for AEs as well as EMEs The volatility in financial markets represented by the VIX is a significant driver of the common component of core inflation but not of headline inflation Shocks to global crude and food prices and the US dollar have stronger impact on the common component of headline inflation than that of core inflation Table I21 References Forni M HallinM Lippi M and Reichlin R 2000 The Generalized DynamicFactor Model Identification and Estimation The Review of Economics and Statistics Vol 82 pp 540554 Ha J Kose M A and F Ohnsorge 2019 Inflation in Emerging and Developing Economies Evolution Drivers and Policies Washington DC World Bank ii International Crude Oil Prices Global crude oil prices have remained highly volatile over the past six months An escalation of geopolitical hostilities and further production cuts by OPEC plus amidst strong demand pose upside risks to global crude prices Assuming crude oil price to be 10 per cent above the baseline domestic inflation and growth could be higher by 30 bps and weaker by around 15 bps respectively Conversely a deescalation of geopolitical tensions improved supply from nonOPEC producers and alternative energy sources and a further weakening of global demand owing to aggressive monetary policy actions by central banks may pull down crude oil prices If crude oil prices fall by 10 per cent relative to the baseline and assuming their full passthrough to domestic product prices inflation could ease by around 30 bps with a boost of 15 bps to growth Charts I11a and I12a iii Exchange Rate The INR has fluctuated in both directions against the US dollar over the past six months Looking ahead the higher for longer interest rate scenario in the US and other AEs could keep risk aversion towards EME assets elevated and impinge upon capital flows Global foreign direct investment flows are also slowing Crude oil and other commodity prices could harden over the baseline Should the INR depreciate by 5 per cent over the baseline inflation could edge up by around 35 bps while GDP growth could be higher by around 25 bps through stimulating exports On the other hand the Indian economy remains the bright spot in the global economy and is pivotal to the global outlook These developments along with a strengthening of domestic macroeconomic fundamentals could enhance Indias attraction as a destination for foreign investors In this scenario if the INR appreciates by 5 per cent relative to the baseline inflation and GDP growth could moderate by around 35 bps and 25 bps respectively Charts I11b and I12b iv Food Inflation Food inflation exhibited sizeable volatility in H1202324 driven by large shocks to vegetable prices due to extreme weather events which are occurring more frequently and with more force The risk of El Nio has materialised resulting in the driest August on record and water reservoir levels have dipped below the decadal average levels These developments impart a heightened uncertainty to the kharif and the ensuing rabi crops The global food price outlook is also subject to significant upside risks from the historically unprecedented heatwave sweeping across the globe All these developments could impart sizeable upside to the domestic food inflation trajectory and could raise headline inflation by around 100 bps over the baseline On the other hand given the robust kharif sowing improved irrigation facilities the IOD turning positive ample foodgrains buffer stocks and effective supply management could help ease food inflationary pressures and pull headline inflation 50 bps below the baseline Charts I11b and I12b I5 Conclusion Economic activity in India is expected to remain backed up by strong macroeconomic fundamentals Large supply shocks are however leading to recurrent bouts of inflation and pose challenge to the overall outlook The uneven southwest monsoon El Nio formation and the volatile global food prices outlook impart significant uncertainty to the outlook of food and headline inflation even as core inflation is showing some signs of easing Thus price developments warrant heightened vigil and monetary policy remains focused on aligning inflation with the target A firm anchoring of inflationary expectations can pave the path for sustained growth in the mediumterm Geopolitical hostilities stubborn global inflation volatile global financial markets and energy prices and climate shocks are the key risks to the growth and the inflation outlook 1 The Reserve Banks inflation expectations survey of

prices Since the April 2023 MPR consumer price index CPI headline inflation1 has seen considerable volatility moving in a wide range of 43 per cent to 74 per cent during FebruaryAugust 2023 It initially moderated from 64 per cent in February 2023 to 43 per cent in May 2023 These gains were reversed from June on accentuation of food price pressures and headline inflation surged to 74 per cent in July In August the onset of vegetable price correction softened it to 68 per cent Core inflation CPI excluding food and fuel2 has eased between February and August 2023 by 13 percentage points Chart II1 The Reserve Bank of India RBI Act enjoins the RBI to set out deviations of actual inflation outcomes from projections if any and the underlying reasons thereof The April 2023 MPR had projected inflation at 51 per cent for Q1202324 and 54 per cent for Q2 Chart II2 In Q1 actual inflation at 46 per cent trailed projection by 50 basis points bps as food inflation turned out to be lower than anticipated due to a muted seasonal pickup in vegetables prices during AprilMay and a sustained decline in prices of edible oil In Q2 JulyAugust on the other hand the actual outcome at 71 per cent exceeded the projection by 170 bps due to a steep rise in vegetables prices particularly those of tomatoes In fact vegetable prices and even overall food prices registered the highest month over month increase in the current CPI series 2012100 in July resulting in the projection error II1 Consumer Prices During H1202324 headline inflation movements benefited from strong favourable base effects3 averaging one percentage point during MarchMay 2023 which pulled down headline inflation from 64 per cent in February to 43 per cent in May Thereafter a pickup in the price momentum alongside waning base effects led to an uptick in headline inflation to 49 per cent in June In July an alltime high momentum in food prices 57 per cent and strong momentum in fuel 18 per cent led to a record monthly momentum of 290 bps in headline inflation pushing the yoy inflation to 74 per cent In August a decline in momentum along with favourable base effects helped soften inflation to 68 per cent Chart II3 The CPI inflation distribution during 2023 visvis the earlier years was marked by a significant increase in standard deviation mirroring the large variation in inflation rates even as the mean of the distribution fell to 58 per cent in 2023 JanuaryAugust from 68 per cent in the corresponding period of 2022 Chart II4 Inflation variability increased substantially across the CPI subgroups during JulyAugust 2023 following the vegetable price shock Chart II5 Diffusion indices DIs4 softened during MarchMay 2023 as the fall in inflation was accompanied by a narrowing of the spread of price increases across the CPI basket driven largely by prices of goods Chart II6a Moreover unlike a year ago when price increases in excess of 4 per cent on a seasonally adjusted annualised rate saar basis were the norm across the CPI basket there was a marked slowdown in the magnitude of price increases since March 2023 as measured by threshold DI5 Chart II6b During JuneAugust the diffusion of price increases broadened across goods and services though a majority of items registered price increases of less than 4 per cent on a saar basis II2 Drivers of Inflation A historical decomposition of inflation using a vector autoregression VAR6 model indicates that the moderation in inflation in Q1202324 came from a waning of supply side shocks as also from the disinflation engendered by the transmission of past monetary policy actions Of the 270 bps moderation in headline inflation from 73 per cent in AprilJune 2022 to 46 per cent in AprilJune 2023 130 bps was due to monetary policy tightening a cumulative increase of 250 bps in the policy rate and the remaining 140 bps was due to the waning of supply shocks The jump in inflation in Q2202324 up to August was entirely due to adverse supply shocks even though the restraining effects of cumulative monetary tightening were still playing out Chart II7a Goods inflation with a weight of 766 per cent in overall CPI contributed around threefourths of headline inflation during MarchMay 2023 and services with a weight of 234 per cent the remaining onefourth By August the contribution of goods to overall inflation rose to 81 per cent Chart II7b Within goods perishable items nondurable with a 7day recall7 particularly fruits vegetables and other food items such as eggs meat fish and milk were the main drivers The contribution of semiperishable items nondurable goods with a 30day recall such as petroleum products household items particularly washing soaps and powders personal care items like toiletries and medicines declined from 46 per cent in March 2023 to 29 per cent in August Similarly the contribution of durables goods with a 365day recall like clothing and footwear items motor cyclescooter and household goods furniture and electronic items to overall inflation declined to 9 per cent in August 2023 from 14 per cent in March 2023 With the gradual moderation in the international commodity prices since September 2022 the contribution of imported components8 to headline inflation turned negative towards the end of 2022 driven down by the yoy fall in the prices of edible oils energy electronic goods parts and polymer Chart II7c With the pickup in the global commodity prices in July 2023 primarily driven by energy prices the negative contribution of imported inflation lessened to 12 per cent in August Food Group Food and beverages weight of 459 per cent in the CPI basket inflation which was muted in Q1202324 at 41 per cent increased sharply to 106 per cent in July led by the steep increase in vegetables prices With corrections in the vegetable prices on fresh crop arrivals food inflation moderated to 92 per cent in August CPI food inflation excluding vegetables however increased to 64 per cent during JulyAugust from 54 per cent in Q1 as inflation in respect of cereals pulses and spices remained elevated Inflation in oils and fats remained in deflation partially offsetting the upside pressures across other major subgroups in the food basket Chart II8 The sharp increase in vegetables prices in July was due to supply disruptions caused by heavy rainfall and floods in the northern parts of the country and lower production due to pest attacks on crops in Karnataka and Maharashtra Uneven rainfall distribution delayed sowing of rice and lower stock of wheat along with lower production of spices contributed to the hardening of prices in cereals and spices The overall food price buildup in 202324 was higher than historical patterns driven by vegetables spices pulses sugar and cereals The price buildups in six of the twelve subgroups fruits meat and fish milk prepared meals nonalcoholic beverages and eggs were lower than their longterm averages Chart II9 Inflation in cereals weight of 97 per cent in the CPI and 211 per cent in the food and beverages group remained elevated during AprilAugust 2023 Chart II10 After a decline between March and May 2023 wheat prices surged as rabi wheat crop was impacted by unseasonal rains Rice prices increased sharply as uneven rainfall distribution led to delay in kharif sowing However sowing eventually picked up 19 per cent over last year as on September 29 2023 on account of revival in monsoon As part of the supply side interventions to improve domestic supply and ease price pressures the Government i announced to release a cumulative 5 million tonnes of wheat and 25 million tonnes of rice in the open market in a phased manner ii imposed an export duty on parboiled rice restricted exports of nonbasmati rice and levied stock limits on wheat and iii stopped the diversion of subsidised rice to distilleries for ethanol production After being in deflation during November 2022June 2023 prices of vegetables weight of 60 per cent in the CPI and 132 per cent in the food and beverages group increased sharply to record a yoy inflation of 374 per cent in July 2023 due to weather related crop damage and disrupted supply chains in North India A pickup in market arrivals and improved supply conditions caused inflation in this category to moderate to 261 per cent in August Chart II11 Among key vegetables tomato prices on a yoy basis surged by 2021 per cent in July A revival in market arrivals moderated tomato price inflation to 1803 per cent in August 2023 Potato prices have remained in deflation since February 2023 on account of higher production last year an increase of 63 per cent in 202223 as per 1st advance estimates AE over 202122 Onion prices which were in deflation during September 2021May 2023 recorded an inflation of 232 per cent in August 2023 on lower production 21 per cent in 202223 1st AE over 202122 as well as low quality of the rabi crop reducing shelf life Overall the record price increase in July propelled the tomato onion and potato TOP group price buildup JulyAugust over March to one of the largest ever seen in the current CPI series Chart II12a Vegetables excluding TOP ginger garlic cauliflower cabbage brinjal and green chillies also witnessed high price pressures in July due to rain induced supply disturbances The price buildup in nonTOP vegetables during 202324 up to August was unprecedented by historical patterns and contributed substantially to the spike in vegetables inflation Chart II12b With the improving supply situation the prices of vegetables excluding TOP corrected in August To rein in prices the government announced sale of tomatoes at concessional rates at several markets in the country during JulyAugust 2023 and release of onions under the Price Stabilisation Fund at subsidised rates from the buffer stocks Inflation in fruits weight of 29 per cent in the CPI and 63 per cent within the food and beverages group has moderated since April 2023 on the back of higher production 02 per cent as per 202223 1st AE over 202122 However there was an uptick in inflation in JulyAugust 2023 primarily driven by a rise in apple prices to 213 per cent yoy in August from an average of 51 per cent in Q1202324 as floods in Himachal Pradesh damaged apple plantations and led to supply disruptions Mango prices remained in deflation since April 2023 while banana price inflation moderated from 218 per cent in March 2023 to 22 per cent in August on the back of comfortable production Inflation in pulses weight of 24 per cent in the CPI and 52 per cent in the food and beverages group increased gradually with a substantial price buildup from April leading to a print of 130 per cent in August 2023 The uptick came from lower production and deficient kharif sowing As per the 3rd AE of 202223 the kharif production of pulses was lower than the final estimates for 202122 particularly for tur and urad 187 per cent and 32 per cent respectively Owing to the downward revision the pulses stocktouse STU ratio has also fallen Furthermore deficient kharif sowing of 49 per cent in tur 13 per cent in urad and 60 per cent in moong as on September 29 2023 also added to price pressures Chart II13 and Chart II14 To contain price pressures and improve domestic availability the government i imposed stock limits on tur and urad on June 2 2023 which will be effective till December 31 2023 ii removed procurement ceilings of 40 per cent for tur urad and masoor under the Price Support Scheme PSS for 202324 to encourage higher sowing acreage and iii decided to release tur from the national buffer in a calibrated manner Prices of animalbased protein items increased sharply in H1202324 AprilAugust driven by milk and products weight of 66 per cent in the CPI and 144 per cent within the food and beverages group Chart II15 which averaged 85 per cent during AprilAugust 2023 as major milk cooperatives like Amul raised retail prices by 23 per litre twice from February 2023 citing high input costs Prices of eggs meat and fish eased in JulyAugust 2023 due to low seasonal demand Prices of oils and fats weight of 36 per cent in the CPI and 78 per cent within the food and beverages group were in deflation during AprilAugust 2023 reflecting falling international prices and higher domestic production of oilseeds 80 per cent as per 3rd AE of 202223 over 202122 Chart II16 As part of price stabilisation measures the government reduced the basic import duty on refined soyabean oil and refined sunflower oil from 175 per cent to 125 per cent on June 15 2023 effective till March 31 2024 and exempted imports of crude soybean oil and crude sunflower oil from basic customs duty and agriculture infrastructure and development cess AIDC till June 30 2023 for tariff rate quota TRQ holders to ensure domestic availability and affordable prices Ghee and butter price inflation remained at elevated levels reflecting the passthrough of higher milk prices Inflation in prices of sugar and confectionery weight of 14 per cent in the CPI and 30 per cent in the food and beverages group increased gradually during AprilAugust 2023 reflecting reduced production in 202223 season from the earlier estimate and the pickup in demand during summer months Among other food items inflation in prices of spices witnessed a sustained rise averaging 199 per cent during AprilAugust 2023 and driven mainly by jeera cumin and dry chillies due to subdued production for the second consecutive year in 202223 on account of poor weather conditions and crop substitution in major producing states On a yoy basis jeera recorded the highest increase in prices at 1182 per cent in August inflation in prices of dry chillies was also elevated averaging 242 per cent during AprilAugust 2023 Inflation in prepared meals moderated gradually reflecting the waning of the passthrough of past increases in input costs such as edible oils LPG and transport costs Retail Margins Retail price margins the difference of retail and wholesale prices9 remained broadly unchanged for cereals Pulses price margins underwent an increase during JulySeptember 2023 driven by retail prices of tur urad moong and gram Price margins in edible oils groundnut soyabean sunflower and mustard oil remained elevated and steady even as wholesale prices registered a downward movement Margins in vegetables prices picked up significantly during JuneAugust 2023 owing to the sharp increase in retail margins in tomatoes Chart II17 With an easing of tomato prices starting the third week of August 2023 retail margins for vegetables softened in September 2023 The sensitivity of margins to wholesale prices in the TOP group is the highest for tomatoes and the lowest for potatoes Box II1 Box II1 Vegetable Retail Margins Some Stylised Evidence Volatile movements in food items especially vegetables have brought increased focus on retail margins and their behaviour in the past few years Jose et al 2021 Bhoi et al 2019 During January 2014August 2023 margins10 were the highest for tomatoes followed by onions and potatoes Chart II11a Mapping TOP margins with the corresponding wholesale price levels it is observed that as wholesale prices increase margins also rise During July 2014 to August 2023 when the TOP wholesale prices rose from the 10th to the 100th percentile of the distribution margins increased by three times for tomatoes and two times for onions while the increase was low in case of potatoes However as a percentage of wholesale prices margins were seen to fall From the 10th to the 100th percentile the margins in tomatoes fell from 39 per cent to 23 per cent in onions from 37 per cent to 17 per cent and in potatoes from 36 per cent to 22 per cent Chart II11b The sensitivity of retail TOP margins to changes in wholesale prices can be assessed by regressing the TOP margins expressed as per kg on to their respective wholesale prices bracketed into percentiles of the wholesale price distribution For tomatoes for each one rupee increase in wholesale prices in the lowest 10th percentile margins increased by 30 paise the increase was lower at 25 paise in the 50th percentile and 20 paise in the 100th percentile For onions the sensitivity of margins to changes in wholesale prices was lower and more stable for each one rupee increase in the wholesale prices retail margins increased by around 1012 paise across percentiles In the case of potatoes the sensitivity of margins to wholesale prices remained largely insignificant within the 10th to 70th percentiles and became significant only when the wholesale prices reached the highest end of the percentile distribution Table II11 Overall the analysis shows that margins are the highest and most sensitive to wholesale price variations in the case of tomatoes and least in the case of potatoes The margin sensitivities to wholesale price changes taper along higher percentiles of wholesale prices and decline or at most remain stable when expressed as a percentage of wholesale prices Reference Bhoi BB Kundu S Kishore V and Suganthi D

Impact on Food Price Markups in India RBI Bulletin August Fuel Group CPI fuel inflation moderated from 88 per cent in March 2023 to 37 per cent in July on account of softening of kerosene and domestic liquified petroleum gas LPG prices before it rose to 43 per cent in August With domestic prices of LPG kept unchanged between March and late August the moderation came from favourable base effects Kerosene prices remained in deflation during MayAugust 2023 on a yoy basis as domestic prices fell in line with international prices aided by favourable base effects Firewood and chips prices also moderated during MarchAugust Electricity prices on the other hand registered a substantial increase from May leading to a record inflation yoy of around 135 per cent in August Chart II18 Core CPI excluding Food and Fuel Core inflation CPI excluding food and fuel eased from 61 per cent in February 2023 to 49 per cent during JulyAugust Exclusionbased measures of underlying inflation which remove volatile items such as petrol diesel gold and silver also witnessed moderation in the range of 130140 bps during this period Table II1 Reversing the generalisation and persistence observed during 202223 core inflation softened during 202324 AprilAugust along with a lower standard deviation Chart II19 During AprilMay 2023 threshold diffusion indices of core CPI items registering price increases of greater than 6 per cent saar as well that of 4 per cent saar moved into the contraction zone indicating some abatement in the intensity of price pressures During JuneAugust the diffusion index rebounded but threshold core DIs for saar of greater than 4 per cent and 6 per cent remained in contraction Chart II20 During 202324 AprilAugust the contribution of transportation and communication and clothing and footwear subgroups registered a significant softening Chart II21 The movement of petrol and diesel prices into deflation during Q1202324 along with a softening in transportation fares and communication services led to the sharp moderation in transportation and communication inflation A firming up of gold and silver prices kept personal care and effects inflation and its contribution to core inflation elevated Chart II22 A decomposition of CPI excluding food fuel petrol diesel gold and silver inflation into its goods with a weight of 207 per cent in the headline CPI and services weight of 230 per cent components shows a softening in both the categories but mainly led by goods While core goods inflation moderated by 190 bps from 73 per cent in February 2023 to 54 per cent in August services core inflation fell by around 90 bps to 42 per cent The key drivers of the softening in goods inflation were clothing and footwear household goods and personal care and effects excluding gold and silver Chart II23a In the case of services transportation fares bustramtaxi fare air fare and communication services along with housing drove the moderation in inflation Chart II23b Trimmed mean measures11 also indicate a tempering of underlying inflation pressures with weighted median inflation registering a decline of 140 bps between February and August 2023 Table II2 Other Measures of Inflation Sectoral measures of CPI inflation for rural areas ie CPI agricultural labourers CPIAL and rural labourers CPIRL as also for industrial workers CPIIW exceeded CPI headline inflation during MarchJune 2023 across most major groups During JulyAugust 2023 CPIAL CPIRL and CPIIW edged up on higher food prices in line with headline CPI Wholesale price index WPI inflation which was on a downward trajectory since October 2022 spiralled down into deflation in AprilAugust partly offset by higher vegetable prices in July and fuel prices in August The deflation in WPI pulled down the deflators for gross value added GVA and gross domestic product GDP in Q1202324 Chart II24a Overall WPI inflation remained far below headline CPI inflation during MarchAugust 2023 driven down by the fuel group CPI contains transport fuel petrol and diesel prices of which have remained flat since August 2022 whereas WPI contains in addition to petrol and diesel other fuels such as aviation turbine fuel naphtha and furnace oil all of which were by and large in deep deflation tracking international prices In terms of other major groups WPI inflation in food particularly cereals milk and pulses clothing and footwear and pan tobacco and intoxicants also ruled below the corresponding CPI groupssubgroups Chart II24b II3 Costs Costs as measured by WPI inflation in industrial raw materials and farm inputs entered negative territory in AprilMay 2023 and remained muted since then reflecting easing international commodity prices Chart II25 Prices of industrial inputs such as highspeed diesel HSD naphtha aviation turbine fuel ATF bitumen furnace oil and petroleum coke were in deflation during AprilAugust mirroring international crude oil price movements The other contributory factors were nonfood primary articles particularly cotton and oilseeds whose prices declined due to lower international prices and higher domestic production Minerals price inflation however recorded an uptick during JulyAugust 2023 driven by metals particularly copper on rising demand coupled with limited supply owing to constraints on new mining projects worldwide increased taxes and environmental regulations Farm input price inflation receded and turned negative from May 2023 driven by moderation in the prices of HSD and pesticides Inflation in the price of WPI electricity a key input in both industrial and farm inputs declined sharply post April 2023 on account of a substantial decrease in coal prices coupled with favourable base effects Nominal rural wage growth accelerated to 66 per cent in July 2023 from 57 per cent in March 2023 with both agricultural and nonagricultural wages rising by more than 6 per cent Chart II26 While the increase in agricultural wage growth was recorded primarily in ploughing picking works horticulture watering and irrigation works packaging and plant protection works that in nonagricultural wages were broad based across the rural sector In the organised sector staff cost growth yoy quickened in Q1202324 in the manufacturing sector In the services sector staff cost growth yoy decelerated notwithstanding positive momentum due to a strong favourable base effect The share of staff cost in the value of production rose in Q1 for both manufacturing and services sectors Chart II27 As per the firms polled in the Reserve Banks enterprise surveys12 the pace of salary outgoes for the manufacturing infrastructure and services sectors is expected to moderate in Q3202324 Both input cost pressures and selling prices are expected to moderate in Q3 for services and infrastructure sectors Manufacturing firms expect an uptick in input prices in Q3 with selling price growth to be marginally lower over the previous quarter Chart II28 One year ahead business inflation expectations13 of firms polled by the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad remained stable at 43 per cent during JulyAugust 2023 with a moderate rise in cost pressures and improvement in sales expectations As per manufacturing firms polled for the purchasing managers index PMI the pace of increase in input prices which quickened for the third successive month in August 2023 significantly retreated in September due to reduction in aluminium and oil prices Higher raw materials labour costs and increased demand led to an increase in output prices in JulySeptember albeit at a slower pace than in MayJune 2023 For services sector the pace of increase in input prices started to fall in AugustSeptember 2023 converging towards its longrun average which also led to easing in prices charged to a sixmonth low The inputoutput price gap reversed for manufacturing sector in September 2023 while it narrowed for services sector Chart II29 II4 Conclusion Climate events imparted substantial volatility to the inflation trajectory in H1202324 Going forward the overall inflation and the food inflation trajectory will likely be shaped by the intensity of El Nio conditions the impact of the skewed southwest monsoon and global energy and food prices Proactive supply side measures assume importance in mitigating the adverse impact of supply shocks in the shortrun Mediumterm policies to encourage crop diversification promote climateresilient crops improve storage conditions facilitate value addition in agriculture and augment agricultural supply chains would make food prices more resilient to climate vagaries Monetary policy would persevere in its efforts to maintain price stability to progressively align inflation with the target rate thereby securing the prerequisite conditions for a high and sustainable growth over the medium term 1 Headline inflation is measured by yearonyear yoy changes in the allIndia consumer price index CPI produced by the National Statistical Office NSO 2 Core CPI ie CPI excluding food and fuel is worked out by eliminating the groups food and beverages and fuel and light from the headline CPI 3 A change in CPI yearonyear yoy inflation between any two months is the difference between the current monthonmonth mom change in the price index momentum and the mom change in the price index 12 months earlier base effect For more details see Box I1 of the MPR September 2014 4 The CPI diffusion index a measure of dispersion of price changes categorises items in the CPI basket according to whether their prices have risen remained stagnant or fallen over the previous month The higher the reading above 50 the broader is the expansion or generalisation of price increases the further is the reading below 50 the broader is the price decline across items 5 Threshold diffusion indices capture the dispersion of price increases in CPI basket beyond the specified saar thresholds of 4 per cent and 6 per cent 6 Historical decomposition estimates the contribution of each shock to the movements in inflation over the sample period Q4201011 to Q2202324 based on a vector autoregression VAR with the following variables represented as the vector Yt crude oil prices US per barrel exchange rate INR per US asset price BSE Sensex CPI the output gap rural wages the policy repo rate and money supply M3 All variables other than policy repo rate are yoy growth rates The VAR can be written in reduced form as Yt c A Yt1 et where et represents a vector of shocks Using Wold decomposition Yt can be represented as a function of its deterministic trend and sum of all the shocks et This formulation facilitates decomposition of the deviation of inflation from its deterministic trend into the sum of contributions from various shocks 7 The CPI weighting diagrams use the modified mixed reference period MMRP data based on the 201112 Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office NSSO Under MMRP data are collected on expenditures incurred for frequently purchased items edible oil eggs fish meat vegetables fruits spices beverages processed foods pan tobacco and intoxicants during the last seven days for clothing bedding footwear education medical institutional durable goods during the last 365 days and for all other food fuel and light miscellaneous goods and services including noninstitutional medical services rents and taxes data relate to the last 30 days 8 Global commodities that drive domestic prices include petroleum products coal electronic goods gold silver chemical products metal products textiles cereals milk products and vegetables oils these together have a weight of 364 per cent in the CPI basket 9 Item

inflation distribution items displaying changes more than the specified threshold in prices each month are excluded and the items dropped differ from month to month 12 Industrial Outlook Survey and Services and Infrastructure Outlook Survey 13 Based on the monthly Business Inflation Expectations Survey BIES of the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad The survey polls a panel of business leaders primarily from the manufacturing sector about their inflation expectations in the short and medium term III Demand and Output Domestic economic activity held up well in H1202324 underpinned by private consumption and investment activity The sustained buoyancy in services consumer and business optimism governments continued thrust on capex and healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates brighten the outlook Geopolitical tensions geoeconomic fragmentation signs of a global economic slowdown and El Nio conditions pose risks Underpinning the resilience of domestic economic activity in H1202324 private consumption was driven by stable urban demand and a gradual revival in rural demand Investment activity gained traction from sustained government capex On the other hand weak external demand restrained domestic activity On the supply side the broadbased buoyancy of services activity was sustained by the strong momentum driving contactintensive services Agriculture activity has withstood the vicissitudes of the southwest monsoon Manufacturing sector extended a modest recovery on the back of moderating input cost pressures and improving profit margins III1 Aggregate Demand

Formation Gross fixed capital formation GFCF expanded by 80 per cent in Q1202324 driven up by the governments capex push and a modest uptick in private sector investment The share of GFCF in GDP was 347 per cent in Q1 the same as a year ago Amongst the key underlying indicators imports of capital goods expanded during AprilAugust led by machinery electrical and nonelectrical goods and iron and steel Chart III6a Railway locomotives separators bodies of trucks and buses supported the domestic production of capital goods Chart III6b Coincident indicators of construction activity steel consumption and cement production posted strong growth in H1 bolstered by both residential spending and governments infrastructure push Chart III6c and d Capacity utilisation CU in the manufacturing

cent from 741 per cent Chart III7 Stretched capacity utilisation in manufacturing presages the need for new capacity additions to keep pace with the strength of underlying domestic demand in the economy The interest coverage ratio ICR4 of listed nonfinancial private companies in the manufacturing and information technology IT sectors persisted at high levels in Q1 indicating comfortable debt servicing capacity The ICR of nonIT services companies also ruled above the threshold level of one Chart III8 III13 Government Consumption Government final consumption expenditure GFCE contracted by

centre plus states drew buoyancy from improving economic activity and compliance Custom duty receipts surged despite a contraction in merchandise exports and imports on account of inter alia higher export and import duties for a few items Union excise duties inched down partly on account of the cut in excise duty on petrol and diesel in May 2022 Overall net tax revenue of the central government increased by 148 per cent during AprilAugust The central governments nontax revenues jumped by 794 per cent during AprilAugust 2023 due to higher dividends and profits Chart III11 The Reserve Bank of

to fall to 50 in 202324 from 61 in 202223 Amongst the key deficit indicators of the statesUTs consolidated revenue deficit improved during AprilJuly 2023 while gross fiscal deficit deteriorated due to front loading of capex during this period Chart III12b Capital expenditure of the states increased by 498 per cent yoy during AprilJuly aided by an additional instalment of tax devolution from the central government and an approval of 84884 crores as on July 25 2023 from the centre under the Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment The Union Budget 202324 provided for

For states union territories the WMA limits remained at 47010 crore as recommended by the Advisory Committee on Ways and Means Advances to State Governments Chairman Shri Sudhir Shrivastava III14 External Demand Indias external demand was weighed down by the slowing global economy persisting geopolitical tensions and geoeconomic fragmentation Merchandise exports and imports US terms have been in contraction territory since February 2023 Services trade exhibited slowdown during AprilAugust amidst global headwinds According to the NSO exports of goods and services contracted by 77 per cent in real terms while imports of goods and services grew by 101 per cent resulting in a sharp jump in the drag from net exports to 64 per cent of GDP in Q1202324 from 01 per cent in Q4202223 and 23 per cent a year ago Merchandise exports US terms fell by 119 per cent yoy during AprilAugust 2023 and merchandise imports by 121 per cent The merchandise trade deficit moderated to US 989 billion in AprilAugust 2023 from US 1129 billion a year ago as the decline in imports outpaced that in exports Chart III13 Merchandise exports experienced a broadbased downturn across commodities During AprilAugust 2023 18 out of 30 major commodities with a share of 739 per cent in the export basket registered a decline on yoy basis led by petroleum products gems and jewellery and engineering goods On the other hand electronic goods iron ore and drugs and pharmaceuticals accounting for 135 per cent of total merchandise exports6 contributed positively to export growth Chart III14 Overall nonoil exports fell by 75 per cent during this period In the case of imports 17 major commodities accounting for 554 per cent of the imports basket registered contraction during AprilAugust 2023 driven by petroleum and crude products coal and chemicals Electronic goods machinery electrical and nonelectrical products and gold imports on the other hand expanded Chart III15 Nonoil nongold imports fell by 90 per cent Services exports were buoyed by software services business and financial services and travel services in Q1202324 Services exports growth moderated substantially to 68 per cent during AprilAugust 2023 from 321 per cent a year ago partly reflecting slowdown in key partner countries Chart III16 Services imports posted a muted growth of 09 per cent in Q1202324 with decline in outgoes

21 per cent of GDP in the corresponding period of the previous year on the back of lower merchandise trade deficit higher net surplus in services exports and robust inward remittances In the financial account net FDI inflows moderated to US 58 billion during AprilJuly 2023 amidst a broader fall in global FDI flows Chart III17 Manufacturing financial services business services and computer services were the major recipient sectors while Singapore Japan the Netherlands the USA and Mauritius were the major source countries of inward FDI to India Foreign portfolio investment FPI rebounded mainly through the equity route in response to investors positive outlook on domestic growth and corporate earnings FPI inflows of US 205 billion were recorded in H1202324 as against an outflow of US 81 billion during the same period last year External commercial borrowing ECB flows also exhibited a turnaround with net inflows at US 45 billion in 202324 up to August in comparison with net outflows of US 32 billion in the same period of last year driven by higher disbursements Net accretions to nonresident deposits inched up to US 30 billion during AprilJuly 2023 from US 14 billion a year ago mainly due to higher flows in Foreign Currency NonResident FCNRB deposits As on September 29 2023 Indias foreign exchange reserves amounted to US 5869 billion equivalent to 101 months of projected merchandise imports in 202324 and 939 per cent of outstanding external debt at endJune 2023 III2 Aggregate Supply Aggregate supply measured by real gross value added GVA at basic prices expanded by 78 per cent in Q1202324 119 per cent a year ago led by services sector activity Table III5 Moderating global energy and nonenergy pricessupported value addition in both manufacturing andservices sectors Petroleum product prices have an asymmetric impact on activity the positive impactof easing prices is lower than the negative impactof an equivalent increase in prices Box III1 Box III1 Asymmetric Impact of Energy Prices on Economic Activity Global energy prices have a sizeable impact on output and prices in countries heavily dependent on imports of energy The impact of oil and other energy prices increasesdecreases on output can be asymmetric Rahman and Serlitis 2010 Catik and Onder 2013 Against this backdrop the potential asymmetric impact of oil prices on aggregate gross value added GVA and manufacturing GVA is assessed by using a nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag NARDL modelling framework over the period Q1200506 to Q1202324 A linear model is also estimated for comparative analysis The model includes the real weighted average lending rate IR the global index of industrial production GIIP as a control for global economic activity and wholesale price index WPI of diesel OIL as a measure of domestic oil price All variables except the interest rate are in log form in the longrun equation and in first differences in the shortrun equation Two models are estimated i excluding GIIP Model 1 and ii including GIIP Model 2 The NARDL model takes the following form where Y is the dependent variable Aggregate GVA or Manufacturing GVA and X are the explanatory variables IR GIIP Oil Oil The bound tests confirms the presence of a long run cointegrating relationship The model diagnostics are satisfactory and the coefficient of the error correction term in the shortrun equations is negative less than 1 and statistically significant The results indicate that an increase of one per cent in domestic diesel prices reduces manufacturing GVA and overall GVA growth by around 3336 bps and 2439 bps respectively whereas an equivalent reduction of one per cent in diesel prices boosts manufacturing GVA and overall GVA growth by a lower magnitude of around 78 bps and 49 bps respectively Table III11 In the linear model a one per cent increasedecrease in oil prices reducesincreases manufacturing GVA and overall GVA by a relatively modest 14 bps and 19 bps respectively The asymmetric impact could reflect incomplete passthrough by firms of higher input costs during the upswing phase of oil prices and the lower downward rigidity in output prices when oil prices correct With oil prices remaining highly volatile the adverse impact of any positive oil price shock is thus not fully offset by a similar degree of price correction References atk A and nder A

but the passthrough of the past rate hikes is still incomplete Bank credit growth remained strong Going forward the Reserve Bank will conduct market operations to ensure financial stability while providing liquidity to meet the productive requirements of the economy Introduction During H1202324 global financial markets were volatile reflecting heightened uncertainty around the trajectory of monetary policy Sovereign bond yields firmed up with core inflation remaining sticky tight labour markets and disinflationary resolve in monetary policy stances Global equity markets gained during AprilJuly 2023 on optimism about an early end to the tightening cycle but they corrected subsequently on expectations of policy rates staying higher for longer The US dollar remained volatile as it fell to a 15month low in midJuly but recouped its losses subsequently Swings in capital flows and tight global financial conditions posed challenges to macroeconomic and financial stability in emerging market economies EMEs IV1 Domestic Financial Markets Domestic financial markets exhibited orderly movements Money market rates were largely range bound while government bond yields eased from endMarch 2023 The risk premium on corporate bonds moderated equity market exhibited buoyancy and the INR underwent twoway movements The transmission of cumulative policy rate changes led to a sustained firming up of bank deposit and lending rates Growth in bank credit was robust outpacing deposit expansion IV11 Money Market During H1202324 money market rates oscillated within the policy corridor in tune with evolving liquidity conditions and market operations of the Reserve Bank Chart IV1a On an average basis the weighted average call money rate WACR the operating target of monetary policy was 5 bps above the repo rate Chart IV1b Other overnight money market rates viz triparty repo TREPS and market repo moved in tandem with the WACR which intermittently firmed up above the MSF rate the ceiling of the LAF corridor in August and September due to frictional liquidity tightness caused by advance tax payments goods and services tax GST outflows and the incremental CRR ICRR prescribed for all scheduled banks in August 2023 In the overnight call money segment the weighted average rate WAR of traded deals1 was 5 bps above the policy repo rate on an average basis while that of reported deals was 13 bps below during H12023 24 Chart IV2a The average monthly volume of traded deals 21 lakh crore dominated the reported segment 01 lakh crore due to the Reserve Banks directive to all eligible participants including cooperative banks to obtain NDSCALL membership as well as the restoration of regular market hours in the call money market Chart IV2b Consequently the share of reported deals in the total call money market volume declined sharply from 33 per cent in September 2022 to less than 1 per cent in September 2023 Money market activity remained dominated by the collateralised segments with the share of the uncollateralised call money market unchanged at 20 per cent in H1 The share of TREPS moderated to 64 per cent in H1 from 70 per cent in H2202223 with a

maturity buckets the 3190 days segment had the largest share in fresh CP issuances 45 per cent in H1 as against 49 per cent in H22022 23 Table IV1 IV12 Government Securities Gsec Market During H1202324 the 10year Gsec yield softened by 9 bps reflecting domestic as well as global factors Chart IV6 Yields eased in AprilMay 2023 due to the MPCs decision to pause lower than expected domestic CPI inflation for MarchApril and softening US yields In June yields hardened taking cues from rise in US yields Overall the 10year benchmark yield fell by 21 bps in Q1 to close at 710 per cent In Q2 yields firmed up in July on the back of hardening US yields and crude oil prices but remained steady thereafter in August and September On balance yields rose by 12 bps to 722 per cent in Q2 Yields on Tbills softened across tenors between endMarch and endSeptember 2023 with market expectations remaining anchored on unchanged policy rates Chart IV7 The trading volume in Gsecs and Tbills increased in H1202324 visvis H2202223 Chart IV8 Over the same period the weighted average yield on traded Gsecs declined by 20 bps while it increased by 15 bps for Tbills The overall dynamics of the yield curve are captured by its level slope and curvature2 During H1 the average level of yields softened by 2 bps while the slope steepened by 8 bps The curvature rose by 2 bps as yields in the midsegment of the curve increased more than in the short and long segments Chart IV9 In the Indian context the level and curvature of the yield curve are found to have more information content on future macroeconomic outcomes than the slope unlike in AEs3 To facilitate debt consolidation the Reserve Bank conducted six switch auctions on behalf of the Central Government amounting to 51597 crore during H1 The weighted average maturity WAM of the outstanding stock of Gsecs rose to 1222 years at end September 2023 from 1194 years at endMarch 2023 The weighted average coupon WAC at 728 per cent at

the corresponding period of the previous year Chart IV12c IV14 Equity Market Domestic equity markets remained buoyant in H1202324 due to strong buying support from foreign portfolio investors FPIs positive Q1 corporate earnings and a stable domestic economic outlook From late July however markets reversed some of the earlier gains amidst weak global cues following the US sovereign rating downgrade and hawkish Fed monetary policy messages The markets resumed upward momentum in September amidst optimism over moderating domestic inflation and positive industrial production data with the benchmark BSE Sensex closing at an alltime high of 67839 on September 15 2023 Thereafter the US Feds hawkish interest rate projections prompted some correction in equity prices Overall the BSE Sensex gained 116 per cent during H1 to close at 65828 Equity market volatility was low with the India VIX which captures the shortterm expected volatility of Nifty 50 averaging 116 during H1 as compared

metals experienced a slowdown in credit growth relative to August 2022 Credit growth to the infrastructure sector weakened mainly due to decline in credit to the power and telecom sectors Chart IV21 Services sector credit expanded by 207 per cent yoy in August led by NBFCs Within services credit growth to commercial real estate and transport operators also improved Chart IV22 Retail loans rose by 183 per cent yoy in August and remained the prime contributor of overall credit growth Credit to the housing sector recorded consistent doubledigit expansion 138 per cent in August while vehicle loan growth strengthened to 206 per cent Credit card loans maintained high growth 300 per cent in August reflecting inter alia the buoyancy in demand from contactintensive services Chart IV23 The composition of bank credit has witnessed substantial change over time with an increasing proportion of credit now going to services and retail loans relative to industry Chart IV24 Amidst these structural changes the impact of bank credit on GDP growth appears to have strengthened Box IV1 Box IV1 Bank Credit and Growth Dynamics In a bankbased economy like India bank credit serves as an important input in sustaining the growth momentum and is a key conduit for monetary policy transmission Samargandi and Kutan 2016 Impulse responses from a structural vector autoregression SVAR model including the following variables GDP growth CPI inflation weighted average call rate real nonfood credit growth and bank capital growth for the period 20002023 and for the subperiod 20082023 indicate that i credit shocks appear to have turned less persistent in the latter period ie 20082023 ii bank credit continues to have a positive effect on growth and its impact has somewhat strengthened over time and iii the effect of a monetary policy interest rate shock has become more pronounced albeit less persistent Chart IVI1 A historical decomposition based on the SVAR indicates that the drag from the contraction in real credit on GDP growth is fast diminishing and the recent positive trajectory of real bank credit should provide tailwinds to domestic demand in the ensuing quarters Chart IVI2

average domestic term deposit rates WADTDRs on fresh and outstanding term deposits rose by 233 bps and 157 bps respectively over the same period The transmission to outstanding term deposits during H1202324 up to August at 44 bps outpaced transmission on the lending side 12 bps with the repricing of an increasing proportion of term deposits at higher rates Table IV4 EBLR loans now dominate the floating rate loans Their share increased from 440 per cent in March 2022 to 502 per cent in June 2023 while that of MCLRlinked loans declined from 486 per cent to 448 per cent during the same period Chart IV28 The increasing share of EBLRlinked loans with shorter reset periods and the increase in the MCLRs aided transmission to WALR on outstanding loans of SCBs Bankgroup wise the proportion of EBLRlinked loans was the highest in the case of foreign banks 876 per cent followed by PVBs 732 per cent and PSBs 361 per cent The transmission to WALR on fresh rupee loans during May 2022 to August 2023 was higher in the case of PSBs relative to PVBs while transmission to lending rates on outstanding rupee loans was higher for PVBs Chart IV29a The lending rates of PVBs remained above those of PSBs Chart IV29b The maximum transmission to lending and deposit rates was in the case of foreign banks reflecting a higher share of lowcost and lower duration wholesale deposits in their total liabilities and a high share of EBLRlinked loans Sectorwise the WALR on fresh rupee loans rose by 213 bps for large industry 128 bps for MSMEs and 113 bps for housing loans Chart IV30a For floating rate loans mandatorily linked to EBLR the WALR on fresh loans rose by 173 bps for MSMEs loans by 159 bps for vehicle loans and by 127 bps for housing loans Chart IV30b In the case of repo ratelinked loans the spreads of WALR fresh loans over the policy repo rate narrowed thereby moderating the transmission to actual lending rates on new loans Table IV5 The WADTDR on fresh term deposits declined during H1202324 while that on outstanding deposits rose with an increasing proportion of deposits getting renewed at higher deposit rates Across bank groups the transmission to WADTDR on fresh deposits was higher for PSBs as compared with PVBs Across tenors the maximum increase was observed for shorter maturities up to 180 days Chart IV31 While the increase in term deposit rates in the current tightening cycle has exceeded that in lending rates both in terms of fresh and outstanding deposits loans the savings deposit rates of banks which are a third of total deposits have remained almost unchanged while current account balances share of 96 per cent in total deposits earn no interest This has moderated the increase in the banks overall cost of funds and is mirrored in higher net interest margins Chart IV32 The Government of India GOI raised the interest rates on small savings instruments SSIs which are linked to secondary market yields on Gsecs of comparable maturities by 40150 bps in five successive quarters beginning Q3202223 Chart IV33 With these revisions the actual interest rates on most SSIs are now better aligned with the formulabased rates Table IV6 IV3 Liquidity Conditions and the Operating Procedure The Reserve Bank of India RBI Act 1934 requires the RBI to place the operating procedure relating to the implementation of monetary policy and changes thereto from time to time if any in the public domain During H1202324 the monetary policy committee MPC kept the policy repo rate unchanged at 65 per cent and continued with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation see Chapter I In consonance with the monetary policy stance the increase in surplus liquidity as discussed below and the risks to price and financial stability from excess liquidity the Reserve Bank imposed an incremental cash reserve ratio ICRR of 10 per cent effective from the fortnight beginning August 12 2023 on the increase in NDTL of all scheduled banks between May 19 and July 28 20237 It was indicated that the ICRR would be reviewed on or before September 8 2023 with a view to return the impounded funds to the banking system ahead of the festival season On a review on September 8 the ICRR was discontinued in a phased manner so that system liquidity is not subjected to sudden shocks and money markets function in an orderly manner 25 per cent of the impounded ICRR funds was released on September 9 and another 25 per cent on September 23 and the remaining 50 per cent are to be released on October 7 Drivers and Management of Liquidity During H1 liquidity conditions were impacted substantially by the return of currency to the banking system following the Reserve Banks decision on May 19 to withdraw 2000 banknotes from circulation In Q1 surplus liquidity shrank between April and midMay with the seasonal expansion in currency in circulation CiC and the buildup of government cash balances Between the third week of May and up to midJune liquidity conditions improved due to the i the return of 2000 banknotes from circulation Chart IV34 ii an accelerated pace of Government spending before the onset of the monsoon season and iii the Reserve Banks market operations Advance tax payments and GST related outflows moderated surplus liquidity in the second half of June 2023 In Q2 liquidity surplus rose amidst the continued return of 2000 banknotes with the net average absorption under the LAF increasing from 08 lakh crore in May 2023 to 16 lakh crore in July With the ICRR coming into effect from August 12 system liquidity although somewhat moderating remained in surplus barring a few days Thereafter buildup of government cash balances due to advance tax collections and GST payments tightened liquidity conditions particularly in the second half of September Overall net average absorption under the LAF at 11 lakh crore in H1 was higher than 04 lakh crore in H2202223 Of the average total absorption of about 16 lakh crore in H1 11 lakh crore about 72 per cent was through the standing deposit facility SDF while the remaining was mopped up through variable rate reverse repo VRRR operations both main and finetuning of various tenors Overall the buildup of government cash balances moderated surplus liquidity in H1 which was largely replenished by the return of currency to the banking system and the RBIs market operations Table IV7 In terms of liquidity management absorptions under the LAF and increase in reserve requirements through ICRR were the main instruments for mopping up the liquidity surplus Borrowings under the MSF averaged 29287 crore in H1 higher than 8438 crore in H2202223 peaking at 199 lakh crore on September 21 Net LAF inclusive of MSF slipped into deficit injection mode on August 21 for the first time in 202324 and remained so till August 23 therafter it again turned into deficit mode from the second half of September On a monthly basis net LAF slipped into deficit in September 2023 the first time since May 2019 with an average daily net injection of 015 lakh crore At the overall level the deployment of large surplus funds under the SDF and simultaneous recourse to the MSF was symptomatic of skewed liquidity distribution within the banking system Chart IV35 The frictional liquidity conditions led to the WACR breaching the MSF rate on 18 occassions in H12023 24 six in May three in June five in August and four in September with the average spread over the MSF on these days at 3 bps During H1202324 the Reserve Banks liquidity management involved twoway operations To assuage the liquidity tightness in the middle of May a 14day variable rate repo VRR auction main operation was conducted to inject liquidity amounting to 50000 crore on May 19 2023 Subsequently however with an improvement in liquidity conditions a 14day variable rate reverse repo VRRR auction main operation of 20 lakh crore was conducted on June 2 to absorb liquidity followed by five fine tuning operations during June 513 of varying sizes between 050 lakh crore to 10 lakh crore with maturities between 24 days To alleviate the liquidity stress caused by advance tax payments and GST outflows in the second half of June a VRR fine tuning operation was conducted on June 19 injecting 75004 crore into the banking system With increased aversion among banks to park surplus funds for longer tenors the Reserve Bank conducted sixfine tuning VRRR operations of 14 days maturity in July of size 1020 lakh crore Overall 12 VRRR main operations and 11 VRRR fine tuning operations along with one VRR main operation and one VRR fine tuning operation were conducted in H1 The finetuning operations on average elicited better response from banks relative to the fortnightly 14day main operations with average bidcover ratios of 046 and 035 respectively in H1 Chart IV36 Banks need to hone their liquidity forecasting skills to efficiently assess liquidity requirements over the reserve maintenance cycle and bid accordingly in the main operation auctions since fine tuning operations are neither a substitute of the main operation nor are they standing facilities they are conducted at the discretion of the central bank as per operational requirements Reserve money RM expanded by 64 per cent yoy as on September 29 2023 as compared with 129 per cent a year ago 50 per cent adjusted

corresponding period of the previous year Table IV8 IV4 Conclusion Domestic financial market conditions evolved in an orderly manner in H1202324 Market rates notwithstanding intermittent bouts of volatility remained rangebound across segments instruments and the maturity spectrum Bank credit offtake was sustained supporting resilient economic activity Bank lending and deposit rates exhibited a staggered but still incomplete adjustment to the past rate hikes The INR remained broadly stable and outperformed several of its EME peers The large liquidity accretion following the withdrawal of 2000 banknotes from circulation was proactively managed by the Reserve Bank through multiple instruments Going forward the Reserve Bank will remain agile and nimble in conducting market operations to ensure financial stability while providing liquidity to meet the productive requirements of the economy 1 Traded deals are negotiated directly on the NDSCall platform whereas reported deals are

the Black Sea grain deal Chart 3a Global food prices according to the Food and Agriculture Organization FAO eased by 32 per cent qoq in Q22023 and a further 17 per cent in Q3 up to August primarily driven by a correction in the prices of cereals and dairy products Meat and sugar prices which had hardened in Q2 softened in Q3 while vegetable oil prices reversed the easing in Q2 and rose in Q3 Chart V3b Crude oil prices have firmed up since the last MPR They initially softened during Q2 largely reflecting weak global economic demand Chart V3c Crude oil prices rose sharply in Q3 in response to cuts in oil supplies by Saudi Arabia and Russia that were extended through the rest of 2023 Brent crude prices crossed US 90 per barrel in September touching their highest level since November 2022 According to the World Bank natural gas prices softened by 284 per cent in Q2 because of high inventories as heating demand declined owing to a mild winter The softening continued till July before prospects of a strike at a liquefied natural gas producer in Australia intensified fears of disruption to global supplies in August Overall natural gas prices edged up by 22 per cent in Q3 Chart V3c Base metal prices have generally remained stable since April 2023 in view of weak economic activity in China and sustained monetary tightening worldwide Gold price rebounded in the first half of Q2 on safe haven demand amidst bank failures in the US and Europe It fell in June as central banks purchases slowed down and retail demand for gold moderated Gold price declined further in August as the US dollar strengthened In September most base metals prices hardened on Chinese stimulus measures to support the housing market through relaxation in requirements for mortgage down payments and interest rates Chart V3d Consumer Price Inflation Consumer price inflation is easing reflecting softening energy and food prices improving supply chains and tighter monetary policy It is however ruling well above targets especially in AEs Table V3 Core inflation is relatively sticky and the pace of moderation is tardy Box V1 Core goods inflation eased as demand and supply for consumer goods moved into better balance Services price inflation remains strong contributing to wage pressures According to the IMFs WEO July 2023 update global inflation is projected to moderate from an annual average of 87 per cent in 2022 to 68 per cent in 2023 and further to 52 per cent in 2024 but would remain above the prepandemic 201719 level of 35 per cent In the US headline CPI inflation decelerated from 50 per

personal consumption expenditure PCE price index the US Federal Reserve Feds preferred measure of inflation moderated from 44 per cent in March to 35 per cent in August Chart V4a while core PCE inflation fell from 48 per cent to 39 per cent Chart V4b Box V1 Global Core and Headline Inflation Dynamics The combination of the surge in demand fuelled by unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus and sustained supply distortions and commodity price shocks caused by the pandemic and accentuated by the war in Ukraine triggered a flaring up of inflation both headline and core across the world in 20212022 to multidecade high levels While more recently inflation is easing a sticky core and its potential spillovers to headline inflation have emerged as the key policy concern If headline inflation converges to core inflation then increases in food and energy inflation may not lead to a persistent rise in headline By contrast if core inflation converges to headline this would indicate secondround effects that can cause inflation expectations to rise triggering appropriate responses from monetary policy makers Cecchetti and Moessner 2008 To explore these feedback mechanisms a panel regression for 26 economies comprising both AEs and EMEs for January 2012 to July 2023 is undertaken which indicates cointegration between core and headline inflation Accordingly a vector error correction model VECM is estimated by using the pooled mean group PMG approach Pesaran et al 1999 The shortrun dynamics indicate that the coefficients of the error correction terms in both the equations are negative and statistically significant Thus in the case of a shock both core and headline inflation adjust and the speed of adjustment in headline inflation towards core is somewhat higher than in the core inflation equation4 Table V11 The potential twoway spillovers and the generalisation of inflation risks can warrant priority in policy settings to contain them quickly which vindicates the higher for longer stance going forward References Cecchetti Stephen G and Richhild Moessner 2008 Commodity Prices and Inflation Dynamics BIS Quarterly Review pp 5566 Gamber E N Smith J

inflation remained subdued during 2023 it moderated from 07 per cent in March 2023 to 01 per cent in August with a temporary descent into deflation of 03 per cent in July reflecting weak demand Core inflation across EMEs has generally remained stickier than headline inflation Chart V4d V3 Monetary Policy Stance During Q2 and Q3 of 2023 major central banks across AEs and EMEs hiked their benchmark rates in steps of 25 bps or retained their policy rates at restrictive levels A few central banks especially among EMEs initiated an easing cycle in response to a softening inflation trajectory After initiating the tightening cycle in March 2022 the US Fed raised the target range for the federal funds rate in all its subsequent policy meetings till May 2023 although it reduced the size of rate increase to 25 bps from hikes of 50 and 75 bps in 2022 In its June 2023 meeting the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC decided to pause for the first time in over a year following a cumulative increase of 500 bps In its July meeting the Fed raised the target range of the federal funds rate by 25 bps to 525550 per cent taking it to its highest level in 22 years and maintained the level in its September meeting Chart V5a As per the Summary of Economic Projections released in September 2023 the majority of FOMC participants expected the federal funds rate to be in the range of 55575 per cent by end 2023 and 50525 per cent by end 2024 indicating further monetary tightening this year and fewer rate cuts next year as compared to June projections The US Fed also continued with its balance sheet reduction policy The ECB increased its policy rate by 25 bps in each of its MaySeptember 2023 meetings cumulatively increasing the benchmark rate by 450 bps In its May 2023 meeting it decided to discontinue reinvestments under the Asset Purchase Programme APP from July 2023 while continuing to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the Pandemic

government bonds Amongst other major AEs the Bank of Canada raised its policy rate by 25 bps each in its June and July 2023 meetings after a pause in the previous two meetings March and April 2023 a cumulative hike of 475 bps in the current tightening cycle It kept the rate unchanged in its September 2023 meeting The Reserve Bank of Australia raised its cash rate target by 25 bps each in its May and June meetings while pausing in the JulySeptember meetings It has cumulatively increased its policy rate by 400 bps since May 2022 The Norges Bank and the Bank of Korea have raised their policy rates by 375 bps and 250 bps respectively since 2022 while the Central Bank of Iceland and the Czech National Bank effected cumulative hikes of 725 bps and 325 bps respectively Chart V5a On the other hand the Bank of Japan BoJ remained an outlier maintaining an accommodative stance with the overnight interest rate on hold at minus 01 per cent The BoJ in its July 2023 meeting however amended the conduct of yield curve control YCC to incorporate greater flexibility regarding the upper and lower bounds as references It offered to purchase 10year Japanese government bonds at 10 per cent every business day through fixedrate purchase operations instead of the previous 05 per cent Amongst the BRICS the Banco Central do Brasil started a rate cut cycle in August 2023 with a reduction of 50 bps after raising rates cumulatively by 1175 bps between March 2021 and August 2022 It was followed by another 50 bps cut in September 2023 The South African Reserve Bank continued with the tightening cycle and increased its policy rate by 50 bps in its May 2023 meeting cumulatively increasing its benchmark rate by 475 bps before pausing in its July and September meetings The Peoples Bank of China

policy rate by 2150 bps between June and September 2023 after cutting it cumulatively by 550 bps between August 2022 and February 2023 V4 Global Financial Markets Global financial markets exhibited high flux during Q2 and Q3 responding to changing expectations on the monetary policy trajectory Markets turned buoyant during AprilJuly 2023 as prospects of hard landing receded and hopes of an end to the monetary tightening cycle in the US earlier than expected gained ground Financial markets corrected in Q3 on stronger data and higher for longer monetary policy stances Overall bond yields have firmed up since the last MPR The US dollar has remained volatile with a strengthening bias since August The EME currencies broadly weakened since Q22023 Equity markets in terms of MSCI world index gained 16 per cent since end March reflecting gains in AEs equity markets Chart V6a Among AEs US SP 500 gained about 8 per cent in Q22023 supported by better economic data optimism over the peaking of policy rates and a rally in technology stocks In August and September however sentiment took a blow from the rise in longterm bond yields and the hawkish tone in minutes of the FOMCs July meeting and FOMCs statement of September Overall the US SP index rose by 43 per cent during AprilSeptember 2023 The European stock market underperformed given relatively weak economic data The UKs stock indices declined in Q2 as consumer price inflation slowed less than anticipated but reversed the trend in Q3 with lower than expected inflation print The Japanese market outperformed its peers on continuation of ultraaccommodative monetary policy by the BoJ EME equities barring China and South Africa in Q2 gained tracking global cues and reaping benefits of an early commencement of the tightening cycle leading to lower inflation prints Chart V6b In Q3 however EME equities barring Russia and India corrected on tighter financial conditions globally and volatile capital flows Chinese stocks lost ground amidst the flagging economic recovery Portfolio outflows exerted downward pressures on equities Sovereign bond yields across major AEs hardened in Q22023 and Q3 reflecting ongoing monetary tightening and the slow pace of disinflation The US 10year treasury yield rose by 37 bps during Q2 and rose further in Q3 to its highest level since 2007 following a hawkish policy stance announcement of larger debt issuance by the US Treasury and the sovereign rating downgrade by Fitch Ratings The German 10year bond yield broadly tracked the US market while the UK 10year yield hardened before moderating on a benign inflation print for July The 10year Japanese Government bond yield hardened by 36 bps during Q3 pushed up by the BoJs incorporation of greater flexibility in its conduct of yield curve control Chart V7a Bond yields in several EMEs exhibited a hardening bias driven by domestic monetary tightening as well as global cues Chart V7b Brazilian 10year bond yield softened in the second quarter of 2023 by 219 bps following modest inflation prints In Q32023 Brazilian yield edged up marginally as investors reassessed the outlook on the Selic rate after Julys CPI print exceeded the central banks target of 325 per cent In the currency markets the US dollar weakened in April 2023 but strengthened in May on increased safe haven demand amidst debt ceiling concerns and uncertain global economic prospects Chart V8a It reversed the uptrend in June and July falling to a 15month low on optimism about a policy pivot by the Fed Resilient US economic data and expectations of rates staying higher for longer led to a stronger dollar in AugustSeptember The US dollars volatility was mirrored in the EME currencies exacerbated by swings in capital flows Chart V8b The MSCI Emerging Market Currency Index declined by around 1 per cent in Q22023 and by 04 per cent in Q3 V5 Conclusion Global growth is losing momentum with downside risks to the outlook from stubborn core inflation tight financial conditions high public debt weak recovery in China geopolitical tensions geoeconomic fragmentation and extreme weather events Inflation is easing unevenly across countries but rules above the target especially in advanced economies Core inflation is softening at a more moderate pace than the headline amidst strong labour markets The uncertainty about the monetary policy

the members Dr Shashanka Bhide Honorary Senior Advisor National Council of Applied Economic Research Delhi Dr Ashima Goyal Emeritus Professor Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research Mumbai Prof Jayanth R Varma Professor Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad Dr Rajiv Ranjan Executive Director the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB2c of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 Dr Michael Debabrata Patra Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das Governor 3 According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 the Reserve Bank shall publish on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following namely the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee ascribed to such member on the resolution adopted in the said meeting and 4 The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence households inflation expectations corporate sector performance credit conditions the outlook for the industrial services and infrastructure sectors and the projections of professional forecasters The MPC also reviewed in detail the staffs macroeconomic projections and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below Resolution 5 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation the Monetary Policy Committee MPC at its meeting today August 10 2023 decided to 6 The standing deposit facility SDF rate remains unchanged at 625 per cent and the marginal standing facility MSF rate and the Bank Rate at 675 per cent These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the mediumterm target for consumer price index CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of 2 per cent while supporting growth The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below Assessment Global Economy 7 The global economy is slowing and growth trajectories are diverging across regions amidst moderating but above target inflation tight financial conditions simmering geopolitical conflicts and geoeconomic fragmentation Sovereign bond yields have hardened The US dollar fell to a 15month low in midJuly on expectations of an early end to the monetary tightening cycle although it recouped some of the losses subsequently Equity markets have gained on expectations of a soft landing for the global economy For several emerging market economies weak external demand elevated debt levels and tight external funding conditions pose risks to their growth prospects Domestic Economy 8 Domestic economic activity is maintaining resilience The cumulative southwest monsoon rainfall was the same as the long period average up to August 9 2023 although the temporal and spatial distribution has been uneven The total area sown under kharif crops was 04 per cent higher than a year ago as on August 4 2023 The index of industrial production IIP expanded by 52 per cent in May while core industries output rose by 82 per cent in June Amongst high frequency indicators eway bills and toll collections expanded robustly in JuneJuly while rail freight and port traffic recovered in July after remaining muted in June The composite purchasing managers index PMI rose to a 13year high in July 9 Urban demand remains robust with domestic air passenger traffic and household credit exhibiting sustained double digit growth The growth in passenger vehicle sales has however moderated In the case of rural demand tractor sales improved in June while twowheeler sales moderated Cement production and steel consumption recorded robust growth Import and production of capital goods continued in expansion mode Merchandise exports and nonoil nongold imports remained in contraction territory in June Services exports posted subdued growth amidst slowing external demand 10 Headline CPI inflation picked up from 43 per cent in May to 48 per cent in June driven largely by food group dynamics on the back of higher prices of vegetables eggs meat fish cereals pulses and spices Fuel inflation softened during MayJune primarily reflecting the fall in kerosene prices Core inflation ie CPI excluding food and fuel was steady in June 11 The daily absorption of liquidity under the LAF averaged 18 lakh crore during JuneJuly as compared with 17 lakh crore in AprilMay Money supply M3 expanded by 106 per cent yoy as on July 28 2023 as against 101 per cent on May 19 2023 Bank credit grew by 147 per cent yoy as on July 28 2023 as compared with 154 per cent on May 19 2023 Indias foreign exchange reserves stood at US 6015 billion as on August 4 2023 Outlook 12 Going forward the spike in vegetable prices led by tomatoes would exert sizeable upside pressures on the nearterm headline inflation trajectory This jump is however likely to correct with fresh market arrivals There has been significant improvement in the progress of the monsoon and kharif sowing in July however the impact of the uneven rainfall distribution warrants careful monitoring Crude oil prices have firmed up amidst production cuts Manufacturing services and infrastructure firms polled in the Reserve Banks enterprise surveys expect input costs to ease but output prices to harden Taking into account these factors and assuming a normal monsoon CPI inflation is projected at 54 per cent for 202324 with Q2 at 62 per cent Q3 at 57 per cent and Q4 at 52 per cent with risks evenly balanced CPI inflation for Q1202425 is projected at 52 per cent Chart 1 13 Looking ahead the recovery in kharif sowing and rural incomes the buoyancy in services and consumer optimism should support household consumption Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates supply chain normalisation business optimism and robust government capital expenditure are favourable for a renewal of the capex cycle which is showing signs of getting broadbased Headwinds from weak global demand volatility in global financial markets geopolitical tensions and geoeconomic fragmentation however pose risks to the outlook Taking all these factors into consideration real GDP growth for 202324 is projected at 65 per cent with Q1 at 80 per cent Q2 at 65 per cent Q3 at 60 per cent and Q4 at 57 per cent with risks broadly balanced Real GDP growth for Q1202425 is projected at 66 per cent Chart 2 14 The headline inflation is likely to witness a spike in the near months on account of supply disruptions due to adverse weather conditions It is important to be vigilant about these shocks with a readiness to act appropriately so as to ensure that their effects on the general level of prices do not persist There are risks from the impact of the skewed southwest monsoon so far a possible El Nio event and upward pressures on global food prices due to geopolitical hostilities Domestic economic activity is holding up well supported by domestic demand in spite of the drag from weak external demand With the cumulative rate hike of 250 basis points undertaken by the MPC working its way into the economy the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent but with preparedness to undertake policy responses should the situation so warrant The MPC will maintain a close vigil on the evolving inflation scenario and remain resolute in its commitment to aligning inflation to the target and anchoring inflation expectations The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth 15 All members of the MPC Dr Shashanka Bhide Dr Ashima Goyal Prof Jayanth R Varma Dr Rajiv Ranjan Dr Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent 16 Dr Shashanka Bhide Dr Ashima Goyal Dr Rajiv Ranjan Dr Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth Prof Jayanth R Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution 17 The minutes of the MPCs meeting will be published on August 24 2023 18 The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during October 46 2023 Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent Statement by Dr Shashanka Bhide 19 Growth indicators for the first four months of FY 202324 point to the resilience of the economy in the face of adverse external economic conditions and the uneven spread of monsoon over the months and spatially across the regions The headline inflation rate dropped significantly in Q1 FY202324 but the headline inflation rate for FY 202324 as a whole as projected in the June 2023 MPC meeting was above 5 per cent highlighting the distance to the policy target of 4 per cent The policy rate was kept unchanged in the last MPC meeting in view of the need to assess the course of the inflation rate and the economic activity in the context of the increase in the policy rates effected since May 2022 20 As far as the overall domestic economic activity is concerned the outlook for the near term appears to be one of lower GDP growth compared to the 72 per cent growth rate achieved in FY 202223 The outlook for the global economic growth has become more optimistic with the IMF increasing its projection of the world GDP growth in its July update of the World Economic Outlook to 30 per cent in 2023 from the earlier projection of 28 per cent However there are risks of adverse shocks such as the further deterioration of geopolitical conflicts and the adverse climatic conditions affecting agriculture The same is the case with respect to inflation outlook Vulnerability to spikes in international commodity and energy prices caused by disruptions in supply chains pose a significant challenge to maintaining domestic price stability 21 The high frequency indicators of the economic activity reflect growth resilience and the need for a cautious outlook Merchandise exports and imports including nonoil nongold imports have registered negative YOY growth rates in the recent months Services exports are rising but the growth has decelerated Services imports declined in June Construction related indicators such as cement production and finished steel production point to sustained growth Indicators such as Eway bills GST collection and toll collection suggest sustained expansion in domestic economic activity But air cargo rail freight and port traffic show weak trends The PMI for manufacturing and services for July 2023 reiterate the resilience of the economy in the face of weak external demand conditions and uncertainties faced over the quality of the monsoon rains this year However expectations of the future output are on a cautious note 22 The indicators related to household consumption expenditure reflect its moderate momentum The Consumer Confidence Survey of urban households by RBI conducted in July 2023 indicates cautious optimism for the year ahead the households are optimistic of improved economic conditions oneyear ahead and the level of optimism remains stable at the level seen in the survey conducted in May 2023 The increased consumption spending is still driven by the essential expenditure and the nonessential or discretionary expenditure is expected to gain strength in the year ahead though the optimism declined marginally in the latest round of the survey The trends in IIP for consumer goods also appear to reflect this pattern IIP for consumer nondurables has shown significant growth in AprilMay 2023 and the YOY growth rate of IIP for consumer durables remains negative Indicators of consumption growth such as passenger vehicle sales 2wheeler sales and air travel are higher in AprilMay 2023 YOY basis with the performance slowing in June for the auto sector Maintaining the growth momentum of the agricultural sector seen in the last 23 years would be crucial in sustaining rural consumption demand 23 The impact of the governments capital expenditure support both at the Central and state levels for infrastructure and support for building production capacity in the industry is reflected in the indicators related to industrial activity The IIP for infrastructure construction is the only subsector of industry to register double digit YOY growth during AprilMay 2023 The IIP for capital goods has also registered growth of 65 per cent in the same period but it is a sharp decline from the growth in Q4 FY202223 RBIs survey of enterprises carried out in AprilJune 2023 reflected increased levels of investment plans for FY 202324 The investment intentions reflected in the funds raised for investment purpose in Q1 FY 202324 by the private corporates based on an analysis by RBI are strikingly high The net FDI inflows in April May 2023 at USD 55 billion are about half the level seen in the same period in 2022 Maintaining high investment demand would be important for sustaining growth momentum in FY 202334 24 Considering the developments in the economy and the external global environment the YOY GDP growth for 202324 has been retained at 65 per cent the same as in the June meeting of the MPC The quarterly growth projections are Q1 at 80 per cent Q2 at 65 per cent Q3 at 60 per cent and Q4 at 57 per cent The median forecast of YOY GDP growth for FY 202324 from the RBI Survey of Professional Forecasters is 61 per cent 25 At 46 per cent the CPI based YOY headline inflation rate in Q1 FY202324 is below the 6 per cent mark after a run of above 5 per cent for the previous eight quarters On the positive side in Q1 the core inflation rate excluding food and fuel has also come close to 5 per cent Both food and fuel light components of headline inflation were below 5 per cent in Q1 26 The downward momentum of the inflation is complemented by the expectations of moderating inflation The recent RBI bimonthly sample survey of urban households indicates that the 3months and oneyear median expected inflation rates are lower than in the previous two consecutive rounds The Business Inflation Expectations Survey of firms conducted by the IIM Ahmedabad in June 2023 indicates a decline in the oneyearahead expected CPI headline inflation rate of below 5 per cent 27 Based on an assessment of the various factors affecting price trends and an assumption of a normal monsoon CPI headline inflation is projected at 54 per cent for 202324 with Q2 at 62 per cent Q3 at 57 per cent and Q4 at 52 per cent The projected inflation rate in Q2 and Q3 is now higher than the projections of the June MPC meeting primarily on account of risks to food inflation The Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted in July 2023 provides median forecast of headline inflation rate of 52 per cent in 202324 28 While there is a moderating trend in the headline inflation rate there are clearly upside risks on account of the weather uncertainty affecting agricultural prices The international commodity prices have remained low in 2023 relative to the peaks of 2022 however the volatility has increased for some of the agricultural commodities and there is hardening in the case of energy in the recent period While the spikes in prices of a few commodities may not lead to persistent overall price pressures broadening of price pressures would be a concern The impact of policy rate actions initiated in May 2022 leading to an increase in the repo rate by 250 basis points by February 2023 is yet to be fully realised There are also risks to growth projections particularly as they relate to export demand Therefore there is a need at this juncture to retain the current policy rate and the policy stance to sustain the moderating forces on inflation 29 Accordingly I vote to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent and to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth Statement by Dr Ashima Goyal 30 Since global inflation is moderating without a major impact on growth a soft landing becomes more feasible But financial fragilities in some countries erratic weather and geopolitics continue to remain threats 31 Indian growth also continues to be healthy especially since the rise in fixed investment can raise potential output There are indications investment is becoming broadbased as state governments and small firms also invest more It needs to strengthen further however for which policy certainty and smoothing of shocks is required Export dependent industries such as textiles are not doing well 32 Despite a late start the monsoon more than made up in July Precipitation is uneven however and extreme weather has caused unprecedented spikes in key vegetable prices Even as headline inflation rose in June core inflation stayed soft and professional forecasters expect it to fall below 5 The pandemic related rise in firm costs has more than reversed For example container shipping rates in July were about half their 10 year average rates 33 Since the Indian middle income consumer is price sensitive profits have risen for FMCG firms that have passed on the fall in costs Nominal sales growth of manufacturing companies softened in Q1 according to the early corporate results while real growth rose pointing to factors limiting price rise The RBI end June enterprise survey also shows the moderation in input cost is expected to continue in the 2nd half of the year This should impact pricing Prices are expected to rise but by how much 34 Research suggests that Indian firms change prices about once in three years so the passing on of cost softening is not yet complete and should continue as long as current supplyshocks reverse Moreover for firms that print a maximum retail price on packages the increase is found to be at around 41 This may indicate the inflation target is becoming a focal point The sectoral structure of inflation also supports softening core inflation In IT services where share of wage cost is above 50 wage growth is reducing as export demand slows Wage growth was the highest in this sector in 202223 In manufacturing raw material cost is the largest share of cost and it has fallen 35 In the initial period when inflation targeting was introduced causality was thought to be from headline to core inflation2 Then food inflation could have persistent effects on inflation But later research showed this result was special to a period of sustained high food inflation that began in 2007 and led to second round rise in wages In normal conditions it was the more persistent core that affected volatile food inflation3 Spikes in food prices can therefore be looked through as long as they remain just that 36 The household inflation expectation and consumer confidence surveys suggest households are doing exactly this looking through since inflation perceptions have risen but one year ahead inflation expectations have fallen 37 However agricultural prices must become more resistant to possibly more frequent weather shocks For this diversified and resilient vegetable supply chains are required Wellfunctioning markets respond before price spikes become very large Delhi should not be buying tomatoes only from Himachal Pradesh States can experiment with allowing corporations more direct access to farmer organizations Large food retail chains also buying from mandies aggravates price movement in India Farmer cooperatives have more bargaining power and platforms like Open Network for Digital Commerce ONDC can aid them in establishing supply agreements anywhere in the country Processing and storage facilities must improve In addition to these longerterm actions trade offers short term degrees of freedom in an open economy 38 Preemptive supplyside action that prevents repeated or persistent food price shocks would abort second round increase in wages and other prices that could require further monetary tightening and growth sacrifice 39 Slower global growth is likely to keep a lid on international oil prices Indian oil majors turned profitable in the summer last year and are showing large profits They are in a position to reduce domestic prices Oil price cuts have a large impact on household inflation expectations 40 Commitment to flexible inflation targeting that anchors inflation expectations requires aligning the nominal repo rate with medium term expected inflation The latter is less affected by transient shocks and measurement issues Headline inflation forecasts have risen in the shortterm but remain slightly above 5 for the next year so that a repo rate of 65 still gives a positive real rate of around unity This is the apt real rate given uncertainties in both growth and inflation 41 Therefore in this meeting it continues to be appropriate for the MPC to pause I thus vote for keeping the repo rate unchanged in this meeting I also vote for the present stance to continue since at present liquidity is in surplus and policy needs to signal continuing watchfulness towards bringing inflation to the target The progress of the rest of the monsoon possible supplyside action further pass through of past rate hikes the behaviour of food prices and the evolution of core inflation have all to be carefully observed Statement by Prof Jayanth R Varma 42 In June I warned against declaring victory based on the inflation prints of just a couple of months and expressed discomfort with the selfcongratulatory tone of the MPC statement of that month about inflation having come inside the tolerance band It is now clear that we would have a couple of months of inflation readings well above the tolerance band I view these monthly gyrations with some degree of equanimity Just as a couple of low readings do not call for celebration it is equally true that a couple of very high readings do not call for panic What is important is the projected trajectory of inflation over the next several quarters On this basis I continue to have the same cautious optimism that I had in the June meeting I expect the continuing slowdown in China to keep a lid on commodity prices Moreover rains in July have attenuated the monsoon risks though there are continuing worries about the spatiotemporal distribution 43 Considering the balance of risks I vote for keeping the repo rate unchanged in this meeting I am of the view that the current level of the repo rate is high enough to bring inflation below the upper tolerance band on a sustained basis and also glide it towards the middle of the band 44 Turning to the stance my reservations remain the same as in the past However this would be the third successive meeting at which the repo rate has been left unchanged assuming that the MPC decides to pause now This disconnect between stance and action has completely hollowed out whatever meaning the stance might have originally had and turned it into a harmless ritualism So I am content with expressing reservations about the stance Statement by Dr Rajiv Ranjan 45 In the last minutes I had mentioned how growth momentum had surprised positively whereas inflation was turning soft implying a goldilocks kind of scenario That assessment broadly holds true albeit with a transitory spurt in inflation I had highlighted that the spatial and temporal distribution of the monsoon would be critical for the evolving inflation dynamics As per the latest available information this risk has materialised with the uneven progress of the monsoon manifesting in the form of excess rains in the northwest regions and disrupting supply and deficient rains in the eastern part delaying crop sowing Vegetables prices rose sharply in JuneJuly much above the seasonal trend and the largest in recent memory 46 High frequency food price data for July indicate a major price shock from vegetables particularly tomatoes and this time around it is turning out to be different than earlier episodes Since midJune to endJuly 2023 tomato prices have surged by 362 per cent with more than 80 per cent of the price escalation happening during endJune and first half of July The magnitude and intensity of the price shock this time around was substantially higher when compared to earlier years4 Our historical experience however suggests that the inflationary shocks emanating from commodities like vegetables are in fact transitory in nature In 2017 when tomato prices soared by 27 per cent in the month of June and further by 138 per cent in July this was followed by a sharp correction over the subsequent two months Likewise in June 2016 the steep increase in tomato prices was fully corrected within the next three months as market supplies improved Although the catch up in kharif sowing augurs well for agricultural production price increases observed across other vegetables as well as other food subgroups such as cereals pulses and spices remain a point of concern demanding our vigilant monitoring The forecast of continuation of uneven monsoon in the next two months together with an El Nino event amid volatile global food prices makes the food price outlook uncertain 47 On the growth front available information for Q1202324 shows that domestic economic activity has been holding well on the back of healthy growth in agriculture rebound in the manufacturing sector and continued robust expansion in services activity In the agriculture sector GVA growth is expected to be above 50 per cent on the back of 95 per cent growth in rabi foodgrains production5 Turning to the manufacturing sector the early listed corporate results of Q12023246 suggest increase in nominal GVA with moderating input cost pressures and doubledigit expansion in staff cost When seen in conjunction with negative deflatorbased inflation of around 27 per cent and robust unorganised manufacturing activity7 real growth of manufacturing GVA could be over 70 per cent in Q1202324 Services activity gained an accelerated momentum in Q4202223 which seems to have continued in Q1202324 Among services activities trade hotel transportation communication component was 102 per cent below the prepandemic levels in Q1202223 suggesting that this subgroup will receive a strong positive base effect in Q1202324 Furthermore strong momentum of this subgroup from Q4202223 has carried forward to Q1202324 as suggested by available indicators such as eway bills toll collections GST collections etc Considering all these factors real GDP growth is expected to be around 80 per cent in Q1202324 48 Looking ahead the real GDP growth will be driven by strengthening rural consumption on the back of good prospects of kharif crops the manufacturing sector supported by easing input costs and wide scope for services activity to catch up with prepandemic trend particularly in trade hotels transportation communication etc Thus taking all these factors real GDP growth has been projected at 65 per cent for 202324 49 Monetary policy clearly can do little about the firstround effect of a supply side shock emanating from say vegetables If monetary policy responds to such a surge in headline inflation the policy would likely be excessively tight and induce high volatility in macroeconomic conditions8 On the other hand if these shocks do not go away and become persistent then inflation expectations can become unanchored leading to a drift in inflation away from its underlying trend It may be noted that on the earlier two occasions during mid2020 and during mid2021 the MPCs prognosis of looking through transitory pressures on inflation has in fact proved accurate 50 Against the balance of risks I vote for a pause in the rate action While the impact of our actions so far continues to play out in the economy our job is not yet fully over The costs of high inflation regime are simply too high to take any chances BIS 20239 It is in this context that the primacy of 4 per cent inflation target as distinct from tolerance of deviation from target emphasised in my last minutes assumes importance Accordingly I vote for the continuance of the stance of withdrawal of accommodation Statement by Dr Michael Debabrata Patra 51 With the visceral effects of the pandemic fading the Indian economy is expanding at a moderate pace on the shoulder of the business cycle and the output gap has closed Corporate profitability is surging despite moderating top line growth In the financial sector credit conditions remain strong even as the cost of funds tightens The revenge spending related rotation of demand towards services is in full tide but the peak is subsiding From the second quarter of 202324 unfavourable base effects may create a wet patch in the trajectory of GDP hence strengthening the momentum of domestic economic activity is key to realising the projected path of the economy over the rest of the year 52 Recent spikes in food metal and energy prices have destabilised the international inflation environment as new spates of geopolitical hostilities take their toll on food and energy security worldwide In addition India faces the onslaught of overlapping localised supply shocks which are causing pricesensitive food items in the CPI to spike and push up headline inflation The elephant in India is the monsoon with August shortfalls rendering the outlook uncertain in the shadow of El Nio effects even as Indian Ocean dipole conditions are turning positive 53 Against this backdrop recent inflation developments and outlook warrant careful assessment and strategy Through the current episode inflation has declined from an average of 73 per cent in the first quarter of 202223 peak at 78 per cent in April 2022 to 46 per cent in the first quarter of 202324 48 per cent in June 2023 ie by 270 basis points Monetary policy tightening by a cumulative increase of 250 basis points in the policy rate contributed 130 basis points of disinflation while the waning of supply shocks contributed 140 basis points and other factors offset each other At the current juncture however the gains in output stabilisation are being threatened by the incidence of sporadic supply shocks which elevate the general level of prices instead of dissipating through relative price adjustments within the budget constraint Our surveys suggest that households inflation perceptions have been impacted by these food price developments which is also reflected in consumer perceptions regarding the price level and inflation but they should stabilise over the year ahead as supply conditions improve A risk to the inflation outlook stems from the liquidity overhang in the banking system Withdrawal of excess liquidity should engage primacy in the attention of the RBI going forward as it presents a direct threat to the RBIMPC resolve to align Indias inflation with the target besides the potential risks to financial stability 54 While unanticipated and shortlived supply demand mismatches lie outside the realm of monetary policy the commitment to price stability requires the RBI to see off these price perturbations by guarding against spillovers in India food price flares can permeate through wages rents transport costs and importantly through expectations into core inflation Ensuring the sustained easing of core inflation is crucial to the MPCs objective of bringing inflation down to the target This objective should not be undermined by supply shocks that show any signs of persisting and getting broaderbased Accordingly I vote for maintaining status quo on the policy rate and for persevering with the withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das 55 The global economic environment continues to be uncertain Financial conditions remain tight and volatile Inflation remains above target in major economies Amidst all these India stands out for its resilience and stability and is emerging as the new growth engine of the world 56 The resilience of Indian economy continued in Q1202324 as reflected in high frequency indicators The economy is largely evolving on the expected lines The total acreage under kharif crops has crossed last years levels The manufacturing sector continued to expand supported by moderating input cost pressures Services activity remained strong in Q1202324 and it is likely to follow through during the remaining period of 202324 57 Rural consumption has shown signs of improvement in Q1202324 while urban consumption has remained stable Investment activity is supported by strong government capex State governments capex has also seen a jump10 The higher government capex and the twinbalance sheet advantage of banks and corporates provide a congenial environment for private sector investments to gather pace Private investments are already happening in a few critical sectors like iron and steel automobiles petroleum metals and chemicals These growth drivers are expected to support the real GDP growth projection of 65 per cent for 202324 and 66 per cent for Q1202425 58 Headline inflation had eased significantly from 62 per cent in Q4202223 to 43 per cent in May 2023 reflecting the combined impact of monetary tightening and supply augmenting measures Inflationary pressures are however emerging again with inflation rising to 48 per cent in June on the back of rising food prices Headline CPI is expected to harden significantly in JulyAugust driven by the spike in tomato and other vegetable prices While the vegetable price shocks are expected to correct quickly with the arrival of fresh crops there are risks to the food and the overall inflation outlook from El Nino conditions volatile global food prices and skewed monsoon distribution all of which warrant close monitoring In the nonfood category crude oil prices have firmed up reflecting tighter supply conditions Against this backdrop supply side measures need to be continued to prevent the spiraling of frequent food supply shocks into generalised economywide price impulses The softening of core inflation CPI excluding food and fuel by around 100 bps from 60 per cent in Q4202223 to 51 per cent in Q1202324 is a source of some comfort in the face of rising food prices although it is still at an elevated level 59 The Reserve Banks liquidity management has been nimble and twosided as per requirement We will manage the liquidity overhang proactively using the various instruments at our command while ensuring that the banking system has adequate liquidity to meet the productive requirements of the economy 60 Headline inflation has softened from last years elevated level but it still rules above the target Our task is still not over Given the likely shortterm nature of the vegetable price shocks monetary policy can look through the firstround impact of fleeting shocks on headline inflation At the same time we need to be ready to preempt any secondround impact of food price shocks on the broader inflationary pressures and risks to anchoring of inflation expectations The impact of the cumulative rate hike of 250 basis points on the economy is still playing out Considering all these aspects I vote to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent with preparedness to act should the situation so warrant Further as transmission of the repo rate increase of 250 bps to lending and deposit rates is still incomplete I vote to continue with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation 61 In this dynamic environment we remain steadfastly committed to our goal of aligning inflation to the target of 40 per cent We continuously assess the impact of our past actions the implications of incoming data for the evolving inflation and growth dynamics and stand in readiness to act whenever necessary Yogesh Dayal Chief General Manager Press Release 20232024802 1 Price Stickiness in CPI and its Sensitivity to Demand

Dayal Chief General Manager Reserve Bank of India Yogesh Dayal Welcome to this postMonetary Policy press conference Today we have with us the Honorable Governor Shri Shaktikanta Das respected Deputy Governors Dr Michael D Patra Shri M Rajeshwar Rao Shri T Rabi Sankar and joining us for the first time Shri Swaminathan J Deputy Governor We also have with us Executive Directors Dr O P Mall and Dr Rajiv Ranjan besides my colleague Muneesh Kapur As is the norm I will request the Governor first to give his opening remarks and then I will call out the names for asking the question Over to you Sir Shaktikanta Das Thank you Yogesh At the outset I would like to extend my welcome to all the representatives from the media You have already heard the detailed statement and you had time to go through the Statement the Resolution and the Announcement So let me just summarise what I have already stated and what is the overall thrust of this Monetary Policy Statement India is emerging as the new growth engine for the world In a highly volatile and uncertain world India is standing out for its resilience and stability Monetary Policy has made significant progress towards price stability The recent spike in CPI inflation as I have already stated in the Policy Statement and even in the resolution is expected to be shortlived going by past trends In such situations we need to remain watchful and not resort to any kneejerk reactions If these idiosyncrasies in CPI inflation and food inflation in particular show signs of getting generalised then we have to act and this is what I have also said in the statement We have to go beyond maintaining Arjunas eye to deploy actual policy instruments Let us remember in this context that the deployment of policy instruments is not just in terms of rate and stance there are other ways of dealing with it We have done our bit with regard to the incremental CRR today With regard to incremental CRR this was considered necessary in the background of the liquidity overhang We considered it desirable in the interest of price stability and financial stability It will have an impact on the inflation situation also It is a purely temporary measure and it will be reviewed on September 8 or earlier We will ensure as we have said that there is adequate liquidity available in the system to meet the credit needs of the economy We have done our internal assessment If you recall I paused during the statement and I said that we have done our internal assessment and our assessment show that there will still be adequate liquidity left with the banking system to maintain their lending activities which they have been doing Let me also add that we are sensitive to the cash requirements ahead of the festival season which should be kicking in the latter part of September or early October On the liquidity situation let me add that there are at times pressures on liquidity because of the withdrawal of 2000 banknotes with 87 of it coming as bank deposits So there is a liquidity overhang there is a liquidity excess that has to be dealt with But even with that there are periods when as we have seen in the past and as we may see even in the coming months there could be pressures on liquidity especially in situations or at times when liquidity held in the system goes into the government coffers at the time of the tax payments and this happens particularly around the time when advance tax payments are made with regard to direct taxes or 20th of every month when GST inflows also happen However we have seen in the past that after a few days it returns to the system because government expenditure ensures that the money comes back into the system So there are temporary pressure times on the liquidity situation which lasts for about three to four days and sometimes maybe five days but it goes back into the system So this was on the incremental CRR and on the liquidity situation what I wanted to say this was the third point The financial sector stability is well maintained Stability is a public good and market participants and financial institutions have an equal share in preserving financial stability We from the Reserve Bank look forward to their cooperation in this regard The external sector is also resilient foreign exchange reserves are strong the umbrella has gained further strength and that gives a lot of confidence and comfort to the market I will stop here Thank you Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir for those opening remarks I will invite Mr Mayur Shetty from the Times of India to ask his question Mayur Shetty The Times of India Governor you announced some measures on UPI allowing Tap n Pay and conversational payments Also since the last policy there have been some bilateral agreements signed between the RBI and other governments for the integration of domestic payment systems and rupee invoicing So when will users get to see this on the ground happening Shaktikanta Das With regard to UPI linkage we have already done it for Singapore So far as the RuPay card is concerned it is already used in a few other countries Recently we have signed an MoU with the UAE whereby we are going to link our UPI with their IPP They call it an Integrated Payment Platform IPP that is workinprogress and it will happen in the coming months Discussions are underway with a few other countries also for linkage of the payment system including some advanced economies who have evinced interest in linking to UPI UPI has now become internationally recognised by others It is recognised very widely that it is perhaps the most efficient and advanced payment system in the world This is something which I am saying on the basis of our G20 meetings the Finance Ministers and Governors meeting which was held recently and even earlier We are already in discussion with a few other countries So this is a work in progress Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will invite Anshika Kayastha from the Hindu Business Line to ask a question Anshika Kayastha The Hindu Business Line Good afternoon Sir The statement said that the RBI will review the reset of floating rate loans due to unreasonable elongation I wanted to understand how you define unreasonable elongation given the 250bps rate hike by the Central Bank so far Shaktikanta Das I would request Deputy Governor Shri Rajeshwar Rao to take that question M Rajeshwar Rao We are not considering defining an unreasonable elongation It is something which the Board will have to consider having regard to the tenure and repayment capacity of individual borrowers It is up to the Board to decide what is a reasonable tenure and increasing that beyond a particular period would be deemed as unreasonable It is left to the individual institution to define it We will not define it Anshika Kayastha The Hindu Business Line As per them as in the elongation it would be because they are floating rate it is market linked So what are the parameters that you look at M Rajeshwar Rao We have already discussed this with the CEOs of the banks and we have conveyed our concerns and what action we expect them to take We will stop it with that Shaktikanta Das As the Deputy Governor has pointed out this is something which banks will have to assess taking into account the payment capacity of the borrower and how long his payment capacity is lasting the age factor It will vary from individual to individual the age factor and the payment capacity also it is necessary to avoid unduly long elongation which sometimes may going forward camouflage the underlying stress in a particular loan Therefore the extension of tenure has to be for a reasonable period We do not want to define it It is a commercial decision of the banks and as the Deputy Governor has pointed out the banks and their boards will have to assess and take a decision It is a commercial decision that the banks have to take We are just providing some broad guidelines Anushka Kayastha The Hindu Business Line Will it be on a casetocase basis then Shaktikanta Das Please wait for the circular Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sirs Now I will invite Swati Khandelwal from Zee Business News Swati Khandelwal Zee Business News Thank you Governor You have said in your statement that the balance sheets of the companies are very strong and are very robust and India is emerging as a resilient economy When we talk about private CAPEX it is still a matter of concern so how do you address this and why this is not happening and how much the RBI is worried about this Shaktikanta Das As I have written in the foreword of the last Financial Stability Report that at the moment in this situation there is a twinbalance sheet advantage The balance sheets of banks and balance sheets of corporates both are strong and the balance sheets of corporates are quite deleveraged So there is space for making investments Otherwise it depends on individual companies In my statement I have very clearly stated that private investments are happening only in the critical sectors like iron and steel automobiles petroleum metals and chemicals sectors So investments are happening in many key sectors Therefore going forward it should happen in other sectors as well because the ground conditions are favourable for investments Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir Now I will move on to Latha Venkatesh from CNBC TV18 Latha Venkatesh CNBC TV18 A couple of questions about CRR Can you tell us exactly how much more CRR will have to be maintained I am getting calculations from 95000 crore to 1 trillion to even 11 trillion What exactly is the extra part of the extra Shaktikanta Das You are not very much off the mark Latha Venkatesh CNBC TV18 Some part of the increase in July is because HDFC got merged Now your purpose is to remove the 2000 related liquidity So will you adjust for the HDFCrelated increase and will the calculation be net of that The other point is when you say 10 whether you have to pay a base 45 plus 10 right or 10 does not include the 45 so the increase is a net 55 How should you calculate Shaktikanta Das We have done an internal calculation We have done a bankwise calculation also It will be a little above 100000 crore We have an exact number in our minds but I do not want to say it because NDTL calculations require further finetuning But it will be a little higher than 1 lakh crore and this incremental CRR applies to all scheduled banks Latha Venkatesh CNBC TV18 Now just to add even though the extra liquidity surplus sustainable or endurable liquidity is 35 trillion the weighted average call rate is behaving itself It is almost always hugging the repo rate So what is your comfort figure The banks complain that they also have to keep excess liquidity because of any NEFT So what is your discomfort figure and separately what will you consider when you tweak it on September 8 Will you remove it on September 8 If not what will you consider Shaktikanta Das The action on September 8 will depend on the situation prevailing at that time In between so many things are there GST payments will happen Government expenditures will happen We have to watch the credit offtake from the banking sector also So I cannot prejudge what we will do on September 8 But yes we will review it on September 8 or even earlier that is what I have mentioned As regards liquidity it is a very dynamic number You cannot say that this is the level of liquidity I want to take out It will depend on so many factors It will depend on what is your growth rate It will depend on what is your inflation number Therefore it is neither possible nor desirable to give a particular number because it undergoes constant change We are always nimble in our liquidity actions You would have seen in the past that we have the main operation of 14day VRRR As and when required we have also undertaken finetuning VRRR operations whereby the repo has been injected So we monitor this situation constantly and there have been twoway interventions which we have done in the past We are very nimble and so far as the level of liquidity its a dynamic figure and would not like to venture into giving a particular number Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will invite Mr Manojit Saha from Business Standard to ask his question Manojit Saha Business Standard Good afternoon Sir Despite your repeated assertions the actual inflation and the 4 is still very far Are you getting anxious about it and how long are you going to wait before getting act on it Shaktikanta Das Deputy Governor Dr Patra to take that question Michael D Patra If you recall in May the inflation rate was aligned with the target and 43 is a comfortable level of the inflation rate But then these food shocks came which are unpredictable and their period of stay is also unpredictable We hope that these are transitory phenomena and they will come off when supplies improve and they are improving already So that is the thing It is just that there have been these food shocks which were unanticipated and we will see them off Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sirs I will move on to Mr Piyush Shukla from the Financial Express Piyush Shukla The Financial Express Good afternoon Governor When should we expect the final ECL norms to kick in Sir in the last MPC former DG Jain had said that we will be issuing a fraud classification circular soon Is there any update on that front Shaktikanta Das On the ECL part I would request Deputy Governor Rajeshwar Rao to reply and on the fraud classification I would request Deputy Governor Swaminathan to reply M Rajeshwar Rao The ECL circular as we have said there have been several inputs which have come in Some are technical issues which need to be examined So it will take some more time before the measures are rolled out I cannot give a definite timeline at this point Swaminathan J On the master direction on fraud identification and reporting the circular is under works and we are doing wider stakeholder consultation like Government vigilance law enforcement at this point in time We would be coming out with these guidelines very shortly Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sirs Now I will move on to Mr Anup Roy from Bloomberg Anup Roy Bloomberg Thank you Sir Is Russia investing in Indian Government bonds and Tbills and how much the investment could have been by now and is there any liquidity implication for that when they mature especially after this ICRR Thank you Shaktikanta Das Deputy Governor Rabi Sankar can take this question T Rabi Sankar We cannot say specifically about a country or any particular entity investing in Government securities It is allowed through the FPI route and it can happen through the FPI route It is allowed through the special vostro account route So the actual investments will happen only through these two routes So how much anyone has invested we can say it publicly Anup Roy Bloomberg Would there be any liquidity implication T Rabi Sankar We will have to see it is basically within the system the Rupee balance is within the system buying instruments within the system should not have any significant liquidity impact Yogesh Dayal Thank you I will move on to Swati Bhat Shetye from Reuters Swati Bhat Shetye Reuters So you repeated today that the 14day VRRR remains the primary mode but in your statement you also said that the market has been reluctant to park long terms funds Are you actively considering moving back to a shorter framework I mean the daily operations Whether something like that is likely to be more effective in managing liquidity because we are constantly seeing the RBI coming and announcing the VRRRs but the offtake is hardly anything So is there a rethink on the liquidity framework from your side Shaktikanta Das No I have said that the response could have been better to the 14day VRRR auction which is the main auction and that will be continued Today about 90000 crores or 93000 VRRR will get released today and it will come off for VRRR auction later today So VRRR being the main operation will continue there is no proposal no thinking about going back to doing it on a daily basis We have undertaken finetuning operations on the VRRR side we have done even a 1day operation at one point in time 1day 2day 3day 4day we have done But I have very clearly said that these are done in exceptional situations and cannot become the rule So it will be incorrect to expect that this will be a regular feature Finetuning will be only for exceptional situations Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will move on to Mr Ankur Mishra from ET Now Ankur Mishra ET Now Just wanted your sense of ICRR when you will be meeting on September 8 whether the considerations will be limited to this ICRR only or other options of liquidity might also be considered including CRR as 87 of bank notes have already come so just wanted to get a sense of that Michael D Patra I just want to tell you do not ascribe it to an MPC meeting It is just a review that we will review the demandsupply situation in terms of liquidity and take a view Shaktikanta Das Liquidity decisions are internal decisions of the RBI It is not an MPC decision So it is a constant process So we will review it around that time Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sirs I will move on to Mr Govardhan Rangan from The Economic Times M Govardhan Rangan The Economic Times Good afternoon Governor You mentioned that we should not be having any kneejerk reactions and in future also there is going to be a kind of inflation perkup There could be policy measures beyond just interest rates What did you have in mind when you said that action beyond interest rates Shaktikanta Das We have undertaken one today the Incremental CRR so you have to wait and see That is on the liquidity front because liquidity plays a major role with regard to inflation on both sides in pushing up inflation as well as in controlling inflation We have taken some steps today and we will see and we will deal with it M Govardhan Rangan The Economic Times One of the things is the amount held by the Russian trade circles in the system So how does that get out Whenever it gets out how do you plan to act How do you expect it to play out Shaktikanta Das It has become a part of the system and it will be a normal situation Any trade relation of India with any country is not a shortterm trade relation it is a longterm trade relation irrespective of the country So there is no reason to expect that suddenly a country decides to pull out So we do not see any stress or concern with regard to the quantum that would be held in the Vostro account by various countries Rabi Sankar do you want to add something T Rabi Sankar It may not be accurate to think that the trade surplus is staying in the country because a large part of that is oil and up to the global cap can be paid through normal channels So most of it is getting paid and some of it could be remaining as a Rupee balance in SRVA accounts So do not include the trade balance of US40 billion or something to the amount that must remain within the country M Govardhan Rangan The Economic Times The calculation is somewhere between US1022 billion which is the wide range in which the market is forecasting So which end are they closer really Shaktikanta Das It is not something about which we are unduly concerned because the market has its estimates Whatever is imported below US60 per barrel gets paid in the normal course A part of it is there which is quite manageable It is not as if suddenly one day we will be under pressure to sort of take out that money We are far better placed today as our foreign exchange reserves are at US600 billion to deal with any situation Last year for example after the commencement of the war in Ukraine there were market fears that the Rupee will depreciate to such levels and various numbers were mentioned in the market but none of that happened because the RBI was there in the market and the RBI is always there in the market So we are confident of dealing with such situations if at all they arise but we do not see that happening Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will now invite Mr Benn Jose from PTI Benn Jose PTI Good afternoon Governor You spoke about the CAPEX and there is room for private CAPEX Are you linking not happening that to the holding overall demand and what do you look at The rural demand is not something rosy many companies say that it is flat on a quarteronquarter basis Michael D Patra Yes it has been muted for a long time but we are seeing signs of revival I am just drawing from the Governors statement that was just released He points to tractor sales and fertiliser sales having improved in June Retail twowheeler sales growth has become healthy again in June and July FMCG companies are reporting that their rural sales are improving and finally the progress of Kharif sowing which has exceeded last years level and is still on course to go further is a source of income and livelihood for the rural economy and that will boost the demand Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will move on to Mr Pankaj Aher from The Informist Pankaj Aher The Informist Good afternoon Sir Is the incremental CRR the only tool the RBI had to deal with something that does not seem to be a big durable longterm accretive problem Surely many other tools are available with the RBI but this tool is not part of the liquidity management framework that the RBI itself had set out earlier Could you please explain a bit more about that The market is going to be pretty concerned about this on one hand there is incremental CRR which is a potent tool on the other hand it is applicable only for the past two months of NDTL or thereabouts not on an ongoing basis and it is 10 You said you would review it even before September What is the net impact of all of that would it not have been achieved better by any other tool at your disposal a change in yields on VRRR the SDF temporarily moving up Why ICRR Shaktikanta Das We have nowhere said that this is the only method There are other methods But in the current situation according to our assessment we felt that this was the best action and appropriate method at the current juncture 2000 notes have come back into the banking system As we go towards the festival season the currency in circulation usually picks up This is what I have said in my statement I have nowhere said that this is the only option This was the best option under the circumstances We have various options As and when the situation requires we will deal with it and we will undertake whatever measures are there We will also have to keep in mind and I have reiterated today that we will ensure there is enough liquidity in the system for the banks to continue their lending Why we did not undertake something else that is a part of the internal process Lets not go into that At the moment we thought this was the most appropriate action Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will move on to Mr Sachin Kumar from the New Indian Express Sachin Kumar The New Indian Express Good afternoon Sir To get more clarity on inflation I would like to know whether your concerns regarding the uneven monsoon have eased significantly compared to what they were in the previous review If I may ask also between the uneven monsoon and El Nio which one is the bigger concern as of now as we speak for RBI Michael D Patra Both are concerns for the India Meteorological Department and they have said that during September and October they expect an El Nio event El Nio is not as dangerous for us as it is for South America for instance But we need to keep our guard on because there can be influences on the late withdrawal of the monsoon or extension of the monsoon as we are seeing in recent years The monsoon stays on for a longer time and affects the Rabi crop etc that is the concern Sachin Kumar The New Indian Express Just one clarification Sir Is this uneven nature of monsoon still a big concern for you right now as we speak Michael D Patra Yes the ricegrowing regions of India particularly the east and northeast have not received enough rainfall They are still reporting deficiencies in doubledigit figures But that is correcting currently east is getting a lot of rain So we hope that the spatialtemporal distribution will even out and we will have a normal monsoon So we stick to the assumption of normal monsoon Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will move on to Mr Lalatendu Mishra from The Hindu Lalatendu Mishra The Hindu Good afternoon Sir According to news reports the Chinese economy is dipping into deflation Is it a matter of worry for us Is there any spillover effect expected for us Michael D Patra Yes we have also read those reports Remember that deflation is a situation of declining prices It is not yet defined as a recession which is declining growth The IMF recently has come out with its World Economic Outlook update and they have taken into account This was out on the last day of July At that time they had these numbers with them and they have placed Chinas growth rate at 52 which is a decent growth They have gone forward to raise the global growth forecast for 2023 from 28 to 30 so all that augers well for us In the event we are now facing a little deficiency in external demand because both exports and imports are declining But the good thing is that imports are declining faster than exports to the trade balance is narrowing and becoming financeable Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will move on to Mr Anand Adhikari from Business Today Anand Adhikari Business Today Good afternoon Sir In June this year the RBIs Development Research group came out with a study on the price behaviour of three vegetables tomato onion and potato wherein they looked at the period from 2011 to 2021 so fairly long period and the last 10 years The finding says that if there is a big price change in one of the vegetables the prices of other vegetables might change in a similar fashion I just want to know do you agree with this assessment or is it purely academic Shaktikanta Das Research reports are the view of the researchers But by and large transmission within this TOP Tomato Onion and Potato group does happen if there is persistent inflation in one of them It tends to get generalised within that group That is what I have said If food inflation gets generalised then it is a different story and we will have to act DG Michael Patra would like to add something on the research paper Michael D Patra As you know that Development Research group is a combination of an external expert and an internal team So this has been the subject of a considerable amount of research Governor when he was Secretary of the DEA actually handled this question front on He was telling me from his experience that they were playing with whether it should be a TOP a POT or an OTP But it has been a concern of the government for some time and some measures have been in place to try to sort of stabilise the supply of these vegetables at this time premonsoon So that is a work in progress lets hope we get there Anand Adhikari Business Today I am sure you must be factoring these things in your inflation projection model Michael D Patra Yes Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sirs I will move on to Mr Vishwanath Nair from BQ Prime Vishwanath Nair BQ Prime Governor this question is about the writeoffs at banks Now there is 15 lakh crore number that has come out of some RTI reports over the last 10 years Every bank has always maintained that this is only a technical writeoff and these loans are still eligible for recovery But their history or track record of recovery is abysmal Is it something that the RBI consults itself at all or is this just a financial decision of a corporate entity Shaktikanta Das DG Swaminathan will take that question Swaminathan J Yes we need to get the context right on this One is that it is of course a longterm data of over 10 years There are three four key things that we have to be familiar with One is that once an account becomes NPA prudential norms require the creation of provisions and on the basis of the aging of the NPA as well as the realisable value of security these provisions get augmented and reach a stage where the provisions equal the outstanding in the account So once these accounts become fully provided you are carrying an asset on one side and an equal provision on the other side So as a part of balance sheet management and for tax efficiency the banks as per their Board approved policy resort to what is called technical writeoff This is number one Secondly this is purely an accounting entry where an onbalance sheet item moves into offbalance sheet items and they are parked in typically what is known as Advances Under Collection and there are specialised teams which chase the recovery thereafter The key fact that we have to remember in this is that the borrowers liability to repay or the banks right to recover is not diminished in any manner This is purely balance sheet management Thirdly as a regulator yes this is covered in the FSR and also it was covered in the recent Governors interaction with the MDs of both public sector and private sector banks that we would like the banks to redouble their efforts because these are accounts that are parked in a special account and we would like to see more and more recoveries because they directly go into aiding the PL of the banks and then contribute to the financial wellbeing of the banks The last point that I would like to submit for your attention is that these are NPAs which are 4 5 or 8 years old The realisable value of securities would have diminished over a period of time So the percentage of recovery has to be seen in the context of the age of NPA and the availability or absence of security thereof So I think we have to be guarded in terms of passing judgment over that But what we are focused on is that we would like the bank management to have a Board approved policy for writeoff and also have a followup on this in terms of maximising recovery that we are engaging the banks very adequately on this Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir As we are running out of time so with your permission sir we will take the last few questions I will now invite Mr Hitesh Vyas from the Indian Express to ask his question Hitesh Vyas the Indian Express Good afternoon Sir In April you issued draft guidelines on penal charges on loans So when the final guidelines are going to be announced M Rajeshwar Rao I can say in one word shortly Yogesh Dayal Thank you for the short answer Sir I will move on to Manish Suvarna from Moneycontrol Manish Suvarna Moneycontrol Good afternoon Sir My first question is what is the price of Indias crude oil basket that has been assumed by the RBI in the latest inflation forecast and has it changed from US85 per barrel The second question is on liquidity how much time does the RBI think it will take to withdraw the excess liquidity from the banking system Michael D Patra Our assumption on the oil basket has not changed since June What was your second question Manish Suvarna Moneycontrol How much time will the RBI take to withdraw the excess liquidity from the system as you have done in the incremental CRR which is a temporary tool Michael D Patra Our assessment is that the measure that we have announced today will balance out liquidity Our intention is not to withdraw all the liquidity but to leave enough there for the credit needs of the economy So as of now our assessment is this should do the job but it is a dynamic assessment and we will tell you again after September 8 Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir Last question to Mr Ryosuke Hanada Nikkei Ryosuke Hanada Nikkei Thank you Sir Recently one of the ministers of Japan told the reporter that Japan considered joining the UPI payment system If possible could you tell me about the current situation of the actual discussion and what is the expectation of the RBI T Rabi Sankar Yes we have noted that statement We are happy that a country especially an advanced economy showing interest in the UPI But that was the intention At this stage it is mostly exploratory and discussions The International wing of the NPCI is talking with the relevant agencies there So it is at that preliminary stage right now Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir With this we come to the closure of the press conference today I am sure a lot of hands are there a lot of questions are there and we will address them in different ways in different places Thank you for coming here and thank you to the top management of the RBI for very patiently answering your questions Thank you all Shaktikanta Das Thank you Thank you everyone
https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=56175,Date Governors Statement August 10 2023,As we celebrate Indias 77th Independence Day in a few days I am happy to note that the Indian economy is exuding enhanced strength and stability despite the massive shocks to global economy in recent years Our economy has continued to grow at a reasonable pace becoming the fifth largest economy in the world1 and contributing around 15 per cent to global growth We have also made significant progress towards controlling inflation Our banks remain healthiest in more than a decade with historically high levels of capital declining levels of nonperforming assets and rising profitability Corporate balance sheets are robust with lower leverage improving debt servicing capacity and strong profitability Lower current account deficit and ample capital flows have imparted strength to our external sector The resultant accretion to forex reserves has provided a buffer against external shocks Overall Indias strong macroeconomic fundamentals have laid the foundations for sustainable growth 2 In a moment like this we need to continue with our efforts to maintain macrofinancial stability while pushing our growth frontier further India is uniquely placed to benefit from the ongoing transformational shifts in global economy in the wake of geopolitical realignments and technological innovations A large economy marching ahead with vast domestic demand untapped resources and demographic advantages India can become the new growth engine for the world Decisions and Deliberation of the Monetary Policy Committee MPC 3 The Monetary Policy Committee MPC met on 8th 9th and 10th August 2023 After detailed deliberation on all relevant aspects it decided unanimously to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent Consequently the standing deposit facility SDF rate remains at 625 per cent and the marginal standing facility MSF rate and the Bank Rate at 675 per cent The MPC also decided by a majority of 5 out of 6 members to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth 4 Let me now explain the MPCs rationale for these decisions on the policy rate and the stance Headline inflation after reaching a low of 43 per cent in May 2023 rose in June and is expected to surge during JulyAugust led by vegetable prices While the vegetable price shock may reverse quickly possible El Nio weather conditions along with global food prices need to be watched closely against the backdrop of a skewed southwest monsoon so far These developments warrant a heightened vigil on the evolving inflation trajectory The cumulative rate hike of 250 basis points undertaken by the MPC is working its way into the economy Nonetheless domestic economic activity is holding up well and is likely to retain its momentum despite weak external demand Considering this confluence of factors the MPC decided to remain watchful and evaluate the emerging situation Consequently the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent with preparedness to act should the situation so warrant The MPC remains resolute in its commitment to aligning inflation to the 4 per cent target and anchoring inflation expectations 5 Further with monetary transmission still underway2 and headline inflation remaining higher than the 4 per cent target the MPC decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth Assessment of Growth and Inflation Global Growth 6 The global economy continues to face daunting challenges of elevated inflation high levels of debt tight and volatile financial conditions continuing geopolitical tensions fragmentations and extreme weather conditions Belying earlier apprehensions a number of economies have demonstrated remarkable resilience and the grim prospects of hard landing appear to have receded Nevertheless global growth is likely to remain low by historical standards in the current year and next few years despite the upward revision in the global growth forecast for 2023 by the IMF3 World merchandise trade volume growth is projected by the WTO to decelerate from 27 per cent in 2022 to 17 per cent in 2023 Headline inflation is easing unevenly across countries and remains above the target in major economies While the pace of monetary tightening has been scaled down policy rates could stay higher for longer Financial markets which had been buoyed by expectations of an early end to the cycle of monetary tightening have turned volatile with sizeable twoway movements in response to recent rating event and incoming data Domestic Growth 7 These external factors are likely to impinge on the growth prospects of most major advanced and emerging economies India is however expected to withstand these external headwinds far better than many other countries 8 The momentum of overall economic activity in India continues to be positive On the supply side crop sowing has picked up with steady progress in the southwest monsoon4 The temporal and spatial distribution of monsoon has however been uneven Industrial activity is holding ground as is evident from the latest data on index of industrial production IIP core industries output and purchasing managers index PMI for manufacturing5 Buoyant services activity is reflected in healthy expansion in eway bills toll collections railway freight and a sharp jump in services PMI6 On the other hand commercial vehicle sales and domestic air cargo traffic contracted during Q1 202324 9 Aggregate demand conditions continue to be buoyant Among urban demand indicators domestic air passenger traffic passenger vehicle sales and households credit are exhibiting sustained growth In the case of rural demand tractor and fertiliser sales improved in June while twowheeler sales moderated High growth in agricultural credit and improving sales volume of major fast moving consumer goods FMCG companies suggest incipient recovery in rural demand which will be reinforced by improving kharif prospects 10 Investment activity gained further steam on the back of government capital expenditure7 rising business optimism and revival in private capex in certain key sectors8 Continued increase in import and production of capital goods further reaffirms this trend Construction activity also remained strong in Q1 as indicated by healthy growth in cement production and steel consumption Capacity utilisation in the manufacturing sector at 763 per cent and 741 per cent on seasonally adjusted basis remained above the longterm average of 737 per cent9 The total flow of resources to the commercial sector from banks and other sources taken together has increased by 75 lakh crore during the financial year 202324 so far up to July 28 as compared with 57 lakh crore a year ago10 On the downside merchandise exports and nonoil nongold imports contracted further in June and the growth in services exports decelerated amidst slowing external demand 11 Looking ahead these underlying developments and the upcoming festival season are expected to provide support to private consumption and investment activity The spillovers emanating from weak external demand and protracted geopolitical tensions however pose risks to the outlook Taking all these factors into consideration real GDP growth for 202324 is projected at 65 per cent with Q1 at 80 per cent Q2 at 65 per cent Q3 at 60 per cent and Q4 at 57 per cent Real GDP growth for Q1202425 is projected at 66 per cent The risks are evenly balanced Inflation 12 The moderation in headline inflation to 46 per cent in Q1 of 202324 was in line with the projections set out in the June MPC meeting There was a pickup in headline inflation to 48 per cent in June due to an upturn in food inflation On the positive side inflation excluding food and fuel core inflation has softened by more than 100 basis points from its recent peak in January 2023 The month of July has witnessed accentuation of food inflation primarily on account of vegetables The spike in tomato prices and further increase in prices of cereals and pulses have contributed to this Consequently a substantial increase in headline inflation would occur in the nearterm 13 Going by the past trends vegetable prices may see a significant correction after a few months The prospects of kharif crops have brightened thanks to improvement in the progress of the monsoon Uncertainties however remain on domestic food price outlook due to sudden weather events and possible El Nio conditions in August and beyond Global food prices are also exhibiting a hardening bias on renewed geopolitical tensions Crude oil prices have firmed up in recent weeks and its outlook is clouded by demandsupply uncertainties 14 Assessment of the future trajectory of inflation is a continuous process We have a choice to modify our inflation projections in every meeting of MPC if warranted in the interest of better guidance or avoid frequent changes and revise them only on fewer occasions for simplicity of presentation Given the continuing uncertainties our latest CPI inflation projections for 202324 assuming a normal monsoon is revised to 54 per cent with Q2 at 62 per cent Q3 at 57 per cent and Q4 at 52 per cent CPI inflation for Q1202425 is projected at 52 per cent The risks are evenly balanced 15 Headline inflation projection for Q2 of 202324 has been revised up substantially primarily due to the price shock from vegetables Given the likely shortterm nature of these shocks monetary policy can look through high inflation prints caused by such shocks for some time The frequent incidences of recurring food price shocks however pose a risk to anchoring of inflation expectations which has been underway since September 2022 The role of continued and timely supply side interventions assumes criticality in limiting the severity and duration of such shocks In such circumstances it is necessary to be watchful of the emerging trends and risks to price stability We have to stand in readiness to go beyond keeping Arjunas eye to deploying policy instruments if necessary I reiterate what I said in my June policy statement bringing headline inflation within the tolerance band is not enough we need to remain firmly focused on aligning inflation to the target of 40 per cent Liquidity and Financial Market Conditions 16 The level of surplus liquidity in the system has gone up in the recent months on the back of return of 2000 banknotes to the banking system RBIs surplus transfer to the government pick up in government spending and capital inflows The overall daily absorption under the liquidity adjustment facility LAF was 17 lakh crore in June and 18 lakh crore in July 2023 17 Despite such surplus liquidity market response to RBIs 14day variable rate reverse repo VRRR auctions was lukewarm instead banks preferred to place their surplus liquidity in the less remunerative standing deposit facility SDF Although the finetuning VRRR auctions of 14 days maturity during this period evoked better response from the market11 this essentially reflects greater risk aversion among banks to park large funds under the main operation In this context it is necessary to reiterate that finetuning operations overnight and up to 13 days are undertaken to deal with special or exceptional situations and cannot become the rule 18 In recent years our stated stance on liquidity is to maintain adequate liquidity in the system to meet the productive requirements of the economy Excessive liquidity on the other hand can pose risks to price stability and also to financial stability Hence efficient liquidity management requires continuous assessment of the level of surplus liquidity so that additional measures are taken as and when necessary to impound the element of excess liquidity Accordingly it has been decided that with effect from the fortnight beginning August 12 2023 scheduled banks shall maintain an incremental cash reserve ratio ICRR of 10 per cent on the increase in their net demand and time liabilities NDTL between May 19 2023 and July 28 2023 This measure is intended to absorb the surplus liquidity generated by various factors referred to earlier including the return of 2000 notes to the banking system This is purely a temporary measure for managing the liquidity overhang Even after this temporary impounding there will be adequate liquidity in the system to meet the credit needs of the economy The ICRR will be reviewed on September 8 2023 or earlier with a view to returning the impounded funds to the banking system ahead of the festival season I must add that the existing cash reserve ratio CRR remains unchanged at 45 per cent Financial Stability 19 The Indian financial sector has been stable and resilient as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit low levels of nonperforming assets and adequate capital and liquidity buffers12 Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that scheduled commercial banks SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios There is however no room for complacency because it is during tranquil and good times that vulnerabilities may creep in Hence buffers are best built up during these periods A stable financial system is a prerequisite for price stability and sustained growth This is a shared responsibility in which regulated entities like banks NBFCs and others are important stakeholders On its part the Reserve Bank remains steadfast in its commitment to safeguard the financial system from the emerging and potential challenges We expect the same from the regulated entities also External Sector 20 Indias current account deficit CAD was contained at 20 per cent of GDP in 202223 as compared with 12 per cent in 202122 Merchandise trade deficit has narrowed in Q1 of 202324 with contraction in imports exceeding contraction in exports Services exports and remittances are however expected to provide cushion to the current account deficit We therefore expect CAD to remain eminently manageable during the current financial year also 21 On the financing side foreign portfolio investment FPI flows have remained buoyant in 202324 so far Net FPI inflows have been US 201 billion up to August 8 2023 which is the highest since 201415 In the corresponding period of the previous year there were net outflows of US 126 billion The inflows under external commercial borrowings also witnessed a turnaround with net inflows of US 60 billion during AprilJune 2023 as against net outflows of US 29 billion a year ago Net foreign direct investment FDI flows to India on the other hand fell to US 55 billion during AprilMay 2023 from US 106 billion a year ago reflecting a global slowdown in FDI flows Latest available data suggest that Indias external debt to GDP ratio improved to 189 per cent at endMarch 2023 from 200 per cent at endMarch 2022 22 The Indian rupee has remained stable since January 2023 Foreign exchange reserves have crossed US 600 billion mark The umbrella has gathered further strength and I am not saying this in the context of the monsoon rains13 Additional Measures 23 I shall now announce certain additional measures Review of Regulatory Framework for Financial Benchmark Administrators 24 It has been decided to revise the extant regulations issued in June 2019 and put in place a comprehensive riskbased framework for administration of financial benchmarks This will cover all benchmarks related to foreign exchange interest rates money markets and government securities The revised directions will provide greater assurance about the accuracy and integrity of financial benchmarks Review of Regulatory Framework for Infrastructure Debt Fund NBFCs IDFNBFCs 25 At present Infrastructure Debt Funds IDFs provide refinancing facilities for lenders in the infrastructure sector The extant regulatory framework for IDFs has been revised The key changes in the revised framework are i withdrawal of the requirement to have a sponsor for the IDFs ii allowing IDFs to finance tolloperatetransfer ToT projects as direct lenders iii permitting IDFs to raise funds through ECBs and iv making tripartite agreements optional for PPP projects These changes are expected to further augment the capacity for infrastructure financing in the country Greater Transparency in Interest Rate Reset of Equated Monthly Instalments EMI based Floating Interest Loans 26 It is proposed to put in place a transparent framework for reset of interest rates on floating interest loans The framework will require Regulated Entities to i clearly communicate with borrowers for resetting the tenor andor EMI ii provide options for switching to fixed rate loans or foreclosure of loans iii disclose various charges incidental to the exercise of the options and iv ensure proper communication of key information to borrowers These measures will further strengthen consumer protection Consolidation and Harmonisation of Instructions for Supervisory Data Submission 27 The Reserve Bank has from time to time issued several guidelines on submission of supervisory returns by supervised entities It has been decided to consolidate and harmonise such guidelines into a single Master Direction to reduce compliance burden and to promote greater ease of doing business for supervised entities Conversational Payments and Offline Capability on UPI Enhancement in Transaction Limit of Small Value Offline Digital Payments 28 With the objective of harnessing new technologies for enhancing the digital payments experience for users it is proposed to i enable Conversational Payments on UPI which will enable users to engage in conversation with AIpowered systems to make payments ii introduce offline payments on UPI using Near Field Communication NFC technology through UPILite ondevice wallet and iii enhance the transaction limit for small value digital payments in offline mode from 200 to 500 within the overall limit of 2000 per payment instrument These initiatives will further deepen the reach and use of digital payments in the country Public Tech Platform for Frictionless Credit 29 The Reserve Bank in association with the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub RBIH started a pilot project in September 2022 for frictionless credit delivery through endtoend digital processes starting with Kisan Credit Card KCC loans The pilot for KCC loans is currently operational in select districts of Madhya Pradesh Tamil Nadu Karnataka UP and Maharashtra Recently dairy loans have been included in the pilot project in select districts of Gujarat Based on the learnings from the pilots and to expand the scope of endtoend digital lending processes a Public Tech Platform for Frictionless Credit delivery is being developed by the RBIH The Platform is intended to be rolled out as a pilot project in a calibrated manner It will have an open architecture and open Application Programming Interface API and Standards to which all financial sector players can connect seamlessly This initiative will accelerate the penetration of credit to hitherto underserved regions and further deepen financial inclusion Conclusion 30 We have made good progress in sustaining Indias growth momentum While inflation has moderated the job is still not done Inflationary risks persist amidst volatile international food and energy prices lingering geopolitical tensions and weatherrelated uncertainties In charting the course of monetary policy we continuously assess the impact of our past actions the evolving inflation dynamics and the implications of incoming data for the economic outlook I reiterate our commitment to align CPI inflation to the 4 per cent target on a durable basis We do look through idiosyncratic shocks but if such idiosyncrasies show signs of persistence we have to act As we prepare to celebrate the Independence Day the air is filled with hope and promise Let me end by recalling the prophetic words of Mahatma Gandhi I have no doubt that our country would rise to the greatest height among the nations of the world14 Thank you Namaskar Yogesh Dayal Chief General Manager Press Release 20232024725 1 In terms of GDP at market exchange rate 2 During the accommodative phase of monetary policy ie February 2019 to March 2022 the weighted average domestic term deposit rate WADTDR on fresh deposits of scheduled commercial banks and the weighted average lending rate WALR on fresh loans had fallen by 259 basis points and 232 basis points respectively in response to the repo rate cut of 250 basis points In the recent tightening phase ie May 2022 to June 2023 the repo rate has increased by 250 basis points fully offsetting the reduction in the easing phase However the increase in the WADTDR on fresh deposits and the WALR on fresh loans at 231 basis points and 169 basis points respectively trails the reduction seen in these rates during the accommodative phase 3 According to the IMF annual average global growth rate during 2000 to 2019 was 38 per cent 4 The total area sown under kharif crops was 04 per cent higher than a year ago as on August 4 2023 Cumulative rainfall during southwest monsoon was the same as the long period average up to August 9 2023 The storage in major reservoirs on August 3 was at 56 per cent of the full capacity higher than the decadal average of 50 per cent but below 60 per cent a year ago 5 The index of industrial production IIP expanded by 52 per cent in May while core infrastructure output rose by 82 per cent in June The purchasing managers index PMI for manufacturing was 577 in July 6 PMI services rose to 623 in July from 585 in June led by robust demand and new business gains signaling the sharpest expansion in output since June 2010 7 The capital expenditure by the Central government increased by 591 per cent yoy during Q1202324 Information available for 20 states indicates that their capital expenditure jumped by 744 per cent yoy during Q1202324 as compared with a contraction of 87 per cent a year ago 8 Metals petroleum

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=56173,Date Monetary Policy Statement 202324 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee MPC August 810 2023,On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation the Monetary Policy Committee MPC at its meeting today August 10 2023 decided to The standing deposit facility SDF rate remains unchanged at 625 per cent and the marginal standing facility MSF rate and the Bank Rate at 675 per cent These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the mediumterm target for consumer price index CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of 2 per cent while supporting growth The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below Assessment Global Economy 2 The global economy is slowing and growth trajectories are diverging across regions amidst moderating but above target inflation tight financial conditions simmering geopolitical conflicts and geoeconomic fragmentation Sovereign bond yields have hardened The US dollar fell to a 15month low in midJuly on expectations of an early end to the monetary tightening cycle although it recouped some of the losses subsequently Equity markets have gained on expectations of a soft landing for the global economy For several emerging market economies weak external demand elevated debt levels and tight external funding conditions pose risks to their growth prospects Domestic Economy 3 Domestic economic activity is maintaining resilience The cumulative southwest monsoon rainfall was the same as the long period average up to August 9 2023 although the temporal and spatial distribution has been uneven The total area sown under kharif crops was 04 per cent higher than a year ago as on August 4 2023 The index of industrial production IIP expanded by 52 per cent in May while core industries output rose by 82 per cent in June Amongst high frequency indicators eway bills and toll collections expanded robustly in JuneJuly while rail freight and port traffic recovered in July after remaining muted in June The composite purchasing managers index PMI rose to a 13year high in July 4 Urban demand remains robust with domestic air passenger traffic and household credit exhibiting sustained double digit growth The growth in passenger vehicle sales has however moderated In the case of rural demand tractor sales improved in June while twowheeler sales moderated Cement production and steel consumption recorded robust growth Import and production of capital goods continued in expansion mode Merchandise exports and nonoil nongold imports remained in contraction territory in June Services exports posted subdued growth amidst slowing external demand 5 Headline CPI inflation picked up from 43 per cent in May to 48 per cent in June driven largely by food group dynamics on the back of higher prices of vegetables eggs meat fish cereals pulses and spices Fuel inflation softened during MayJune primarily reflecting the fall in kerosene prices Core inflation ie CPI excluding food and fuel was steady in June 6 The daily absorption of liquidity under the LAF averaged 18 lakh crore during JuneJuly as compared with 17 lakh crore in AprilMay Money supply M3 expanded by 106 per cent yoy as on July 28 2023 as against 101 per cent on May 19 2023 Bank credit grew by 147 per cent yoy as on July 28 2023 as compared with 154 per cent on May 19 2023 Indias foreign exchange reserves stood at US 6015 billion as on August 4 2023 Outlook 7 Going forward the spike in vegetable prices led by tomatoes would exert sizeable upside pressures on the nearterm headline inflation trajectory This jump is however likely to correct with fresh market arrivals There has been significant improvement in the progress of the monsoon and kharif sowing in July however the impact of the uneven rainfall distribution warrants careful monitoring Crude oil prices have firmed up amidst production cuts Manufacturing services and infrastructure firms polled in the Reserve Banks enterprise surveys expect input costs to ease but output prices to harden Taking into account these factors and assuming a normal monsoon CPI inflation is projected at 54 per cent for 202324 with Q2 at 62 per cent Q3 at 57 per cent and Q4 at 52 per cent with risks evenly balanced CPI inflation for Q1202425 is projected at 52 per cent Chart 1 8 Looking ahead the recovery in kharif sowing and rural incomes the buoyancy in services and consumer optimism should support household consumption Healthy balance sheets of banks and corporates supply chain normalisation business optimism and robust government capital expenditure are favourable for a renewal of the capex cycle which is showing signs of getting broadbased Headwinds from weak global demand volatility in global financial markets geopolitical tensions and geoeconomic fragmentation however pose risks to the outlook Taking all these factors into consideration real GDP growth for 202324 is projected at 65 per cent with Q1 at 80 per cent Q2 at 65 per cent Q3 at 60 per cent and Q4 at 57 per cent with risks broadly balanced Real GDP growth for Q1202425 is projected at 66 per cent Chart 2 9 The headline inflation is likely to witness a spike in the near months on account of supply disruptions due to adverse weather conditions It is important to be vigilant about these shocks with a readiness to act appropriately so as to ensure that their effects on the general level of prices do not persist There are risks from the impact of the skewed southwest monsoon so far a possible El Nio event and upward pressures on global food prices due to geopolitical hostilities Domestic economic activity is holding up well supported by domestic demand in spite of the drag from weak external demand With the cumulative rate hike of 250 basis points undertaken by the MPC working its way into the economy the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent but with preparedness to undertake policy responses should the situation so warrant The MPC will maintain a close vigil on the evolving inflation scenario and remain resolute in its commitment to aligning inflation to the target and anchoring inflation expectations The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth 10 All members of the MPC Dr Shashanka Bhide Dr Ashima Goyal Prof Jayanth R Varma Dr Rajiv Ranjan Dr Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent 11 Dr Shashanka Bhide Dr Ashima Goyal Dr Rajiv Ranjan Dr Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth Prof Jayanth R Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution 12 The minutes of the MPCs meeting will be published on August 24 2023 13 The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during October 46 2023 Yogesh Dayal Chief General Manager Press Release 20232024723
https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=56174,Date Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies,This Statement sets out various developmental and regulatory policy measures relating to i Financial Markets ii Regulation and Supervision iii Payment Systems and iv FinTech I Financial Markets 1 Review of Regulatory framework for Financial Benchmark Administrators In June 2019 the Reserve Bank issued a regulatory framework on administration of significant benchmarks by benchmark administrators in the financial markets regulated by the Reserve Bank such as the USDINR Reference Rate Overnight MIBOR and valuations of government securities administered by the Financial Benchmarks India Private Limited FBIL Considering the evolution of the domestic financial markets since then and global best practices the regulations for financial benchmarks have been reviewed and it has been decided to put in place a comprehensive riskbased framework covering administration of all benchmarks related to foreign exchange interest rates money markets and government securities such as benchmarks on certificate of deposits CDs rates repo rates and FX Options Volatility Matrix as well as other benchmarks on government securities Revised Directions which are being issued separately envisage regulatory prescriptions for benchmark administrators encompassing inter alia governance and oversight arrangements conflict of interest controls and transparency These Directions will provide greater assurance about the accuracy and integrity of benchmarks II Regulation and Supervision 2 Review of Regulatory Framework for NBFC Infrastructure Debt Funds IDFNBFCs Infrastructure Debt Fund was created as a separate category of NBFCs in 2011 To enable the IDFs to play a greater role in financing of the infrastructure sector and to move towards the regulatory objective of harmonisation of regulations applicable to various categories of NBFCs a review of the extant regulatory framework for IDFs has been undertaken in consultation with the Government of India The revised framework envisages i withdrawal of the requirement of a sponsor for the IDFs ii permission to finance Toll Operate Transfer projects ToT as direct lenders iii access to ECBs and iv making tripartite agreement optional for PPP projects Detailed guidelines shall be issued shortly 3 Responsible Conduct in Lending Greater transparency in Interest Rate Reset of Equated Monthly Instalments EMI based Floating Interest Loans The supervisory reviews undertaken by the Reserve Bank and the feedback and references from members of public have revealed several instances of unreasonable elongation of tenor of floating rate loans by lenders without proper consent and communication to the borrowers To address the issue it is proposed to put in place a proper conduct framework to be implemented by all REs to address the issues faced by the borrowers The framework envisages that lenders should clearly communicate with the borrowers for resetting the tenor andor EMI provide options of switching to fixed rate loans or foreclosure of loans transparent disclosure of various charges incidental to the exercise of these options and proper communication of key information to the borrowers The detailed guidelines in this regard shall be issued shortly 4 Consolidation and harmonisation of instructions for Supervisory data submission The Reserve Bank of India has from time to time issued several guidelines and instructions to its supervised entities SEs viz SCBs NBFCs UCBs AIFIs etc for submission of supervisory returns Certain issues are being faced by SEs while complying with these instructions due to changes in technology platforms modes of submission and variations in the return submission timeframes In order to consolidate and harmonise the instructions for submission of applicable Supervisory Returns provide greater clarity and reduce the compliance burden it is proposed to consolidate all the existing instructions on submission of data into a single Master Direction which will be a single point of reference for all SEs III Payment Systems 5 Conversational payments in UPI UPI with its ease of usage safety and security and realtime feature has transformed the digital payment ecosystem in India Addition of many new features over time have enabled UPI to facilitate diverse payment needs of the economy As Artificial Intelligence AI is becoming increasingly integrated into the digital economy conversational instructions hold immense potential in enhancing ease of use and consequently reach of the UPI system It is therefore proposed to launch an innovative payment mode viz Conversational Payments on UPI that will enable users to engage in a conversation with an AIpowered system to initiate and complete transactions in a safe and secure environment This channel will be made available in both smartphones and feature phonesbased UPI channels thereby helping in the deepening of digital penetration in the country The facility will initially be available in Hindi and English and will subsequently be made available in more Indian languages Instructions to NPCI will be issued shortly 6 Offline payments in UPI To increase the speed of small value transactions on UPI an ondevice wallet called UPILite was launched in September 2022 to optimise processing resources for banks thereby reducing transaction failures The product has gained traction and currently processes more than ten million transactions a month To promote the use of UPILite it is proposed to facilitate offline transaction using Near Field Communication NFC technology This feature will not only enable retail digital payments in situations where internet telecom connectivity is weak or not available it will also ensure speed with minimal transaction declines Instructions to NPCI will be issued shortly 7 Enhancing transactions limits for small value digital payments A limit of 200 per transaction and an overall limit of 2000 per payment instrument has been prescribed by the Reserve Bank for small value digital payments in offline mode including for National Common Mobility Card NCMC and UPI Lite By removing the need for twofactor authentication for small value transactions these channels enable faster reliable and contactless mode of payments for everyday small value payments transit payments etc Since then there have been demands for enhancing these limits To encourage wider adoption of this mode of payments and bring in more use cases into this mode it is now proposed to increase the per transaction limit to 500 The overall limit is however retained at 2000 to contain the risks associated with relaxation of twofactor authentication Instructions in this regard will be issued shortly IV FinTech 8 Public Tech Platform for Frictionless Credit With rapid progress in digitalization India has embraced the concept of digital public infrastructure which encourages FinTech companies and startups to create and provide innovative solutions in payments credit and other financial activities For digital credit delivery the data required for credit appraisal are available with different entities like Central and State governments account aggregators banks credit information companies digital identity authorities etc However they are in separate systems creating hindrance in frictionless and timely delivery of rulebased lending To address this situation a pilot project for digitalisation of Kisan Credit Card KCC loans of less than 160 lakh was started in September 2022 The pilot tested endtoend digitalisation of the lending process in a paperless and hasslefree manner The KCC pilot is currently underway in select districts of Madhya Pradesh Tamil Nadu Karnataka UP Maharashtra and the initial results are encouraging The pilot also enables doorstep disbursement of loans in assisted or selfservice mode without any paperwork A similar pilot is being carried out for dairy loans based on milk pouring data with Amul in Gujarat Based on the learnings from the above pilots and expand the scope to all types of digital loans a digital Public Tech Platform is being developed by the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub RBIH The Platform would enable delivery of frictionless credit by facilitating seamless flow of required digital information to lenders The endtoend digital platform will have an open architecture open Application Programming Interfaces APIs and standards to which all financial sector players can connect seamlessly in a plug and play model The Platform is intended to be rolled out as a pilot project in a calibrated fashion both in terms of access to information providers and use cases It shall bring about efficiency in the lending process in terms of reduction of costs quicker disbursement and scalability Yogesh Dayal Chief General Manager Press Release 20232024724
https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=55899,Date Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting June 6 to 8 2023,Under Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 The forty third meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee MPC constituted under Section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 was held during June 6 to 8 2023 2 The meeting was attended by all the members Dr Shashanka Bhide Honorary Senior Advisor National Council of Applied Economic Research Delhi Dr Ashima Goyal Emeritus Professor Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research Mumbai Prof Jayanth R Varma Professor Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad Dr Rajiv Ranjan Executive Director the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB2c of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 Dr Michael Debabrata Patra Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das Governor 3 According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 the Reserve Bank shall publish on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following namely the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee ascribed to such member on the resolution adopted in the said meeting and the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under subsection 11 of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting 4 The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence households inflation expectations corporate sector performance credit conditions the outlook for the industrial services and infrastructure sectors and the projections of professional forecasters The MPC also reviewed in detail the staffs macroeconomic projections and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below Resolution 5 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation the Monetary Policy Committee MPC at its meeting today June 8 2023 decided to The standing deposit facility SDF rate remains unchanged at 625 per cent and the marginal standing facility MSF rate and the Bank Rate at 675 per cent These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the mediumterm target for consumer price index CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of 2 per cent while supporting growth The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below Assessment Global Economy 6 In the second quarter of 2023 the global economy is sustaining the momentum gained in the preceding quarter in spite of still elevated though moderating inflation tighter financial conditions banking sector stress and lingering geopolitical conflicts Sovereign bond yields are trading sideways on expectations of the imminent peaking of the tightening cycle of monetary policy while the US dollar has appreciated Equity markets have remained range bound since the last MPC meeting For several emerging market economies EMEs weak external demand elevated debt levels and geoeconomic disintegration amidst tighter external financial conditions pose risks to growth prospects although capital flows are cautiously returning to them on renewed risk appetite Domestic Economy 7 According to the provisional estimates released by the National Statistical Office NSO on May 31 2023 Indias real gross domestic product GDP growth accelerated from 45 per cent yearonyear yoy in Q3202223 to 61 per cent in Q4 supported by fixed investment and higher net exports Real GDP growth for 202223 was placed at 72 per cent higher than the second advance estimate of 70 per cent 8 Domestic economic activity remains resilient in Q1202324 as reflected in high frequency indicators Purchasing managers indices PMI for manufacturing and services indicated sustained expansion with the manufacturing PMI at a 31month high in May and services PMI at a 13year high in AprilMay In the services sector domestic air passenger traffic eway bills toll collections and diesel consumption exhibited buoyancy in AprilMay while railway freight and port traffic registered modest growth 9 On the demand side urban spending remains robust as reflected in indicators such as passenger vehicle sales and domestic air passenger traffic which recorded double digit growth in April Rural demand is gradually improving though unevenly motorcycle sales expanded in April while tractor sales contracted partly owing to unseasonal rains Investment activity is picking up as reflected in the healthy expansion in steel consumption and cement output in April Merchandise exports and nonoil nongold imports remained in contraction mode in April while services exports sustained a robust expansion 10 CPI inflation fell sharply to 47 per cent in April 2023 from 64 per cent in February on the back of large favourable base effects with softening observed across all the three major groups Food group inflation eased with moderation in cereals eggs milk fruits meat and fish spices and prepared meals inflation and deepening of deflation in edible oils In the fuel group inflation in LPG and firewood and chips prices fell and kerosene prices slipped into deflation Core inflation ie CPI inflation excluding food and fuel dipped driven down by clothing and footwear household goods and services health transport and communication personal care and effects and recreation and amusement subgroups 11 The average daily absorption under the LAF increased to 17 lakh crore during AprilMay from 14 lakh crore in FebruaryMarch Money supply M3 expanded by 101 per cent yoy and nonfood bank credit by 156 per cent as on May 19 2023 Indias foreign exchange reserves were placed at US 5951 billion as on June 2 2023 Outlook 12 Going forward the headline inflation trajectory is likely to be shaped by food price dynamics Wheat prices could see some correction on robust mandi arrivals and procurement Milk prices on the other hand are likely to remain under pressure due to supply shortfalls and high fodder costs The forecast of a normal southwest monsoon by the India Meteorological Department IMD augurs well for kharif crops however the spatial and temporal distribution of the monsoon would need to be closely monitored to assess the prospects for agricultural production Crude oil prices have eased but the outlook remains uncertain According to the early results from the Reserve Banks surveys manufacturing services and infrastructure firms polled expect input costs and output prices to harden A clearer picture will emerge when the final survey results are available Taking into account these factors and assuming a normal monsoon CPI inflation is projected at 51 per cent for 202324 with Q1 at 46 per cent Q2 at 52 per cent Q3 at 54 per cent and Q4 at 52 per cent The risks are evenly balanced Chart 1 13 The higher rabi crop production in 202223 the expected normal monsoon and the sustained buoyancy in services should support private consumption and overall economic activity in the current year The governments thrust on capital expenditure moderation in commodity prices and robust credit growth are expected to nurture investment activity Weak external demand geoeconomic fragmentation and protracted geopolitical tensions however pose risks to the outlook Taking all these factors into consideration real GDP growth for 202324 is projected at 65 per cent with Q1 at 80 per cent Q2 at 65 per cent Q3 at 60 per cent and Q4 at 57 per cent with risks evenly balanced Chart 2 14 The MPC took note of the moderation in CPI headline inflation in MarchApril into the tolerance band in line with projections reflecting the combined impact of monetary tightening and supply augmenting measures Headline inflation is projected to decline in 202324 from its level in 202223 but would still be above the target warranting continuous vigil The progress of the south west monsoon is critical in this regard Domestic economic activity is holding up well Consumer confidence is improving and businesses remain optimistic about the future The cumulative rate hike of 250 basis points undertaken by the MPC is transmitting through the economy and its fuller impact should keep inflationary pressures contained in the coming months Monetary policy would need to be carefully calibrated for alignment of inflation with the target Against this backdrop the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent The MPC resolved to continue keeping a close vigil on the evolving inflation and growth outlook It will take further monetary actions promptly and appropriately as required to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored and to bring down inflation to the target The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth 15 All members of the MPC Dr Shashanka Bhide Dr Ashima Goyal Prof Jayanth R Varma Dr Rajiv Ranjan Dr Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent 16 Dr Shashanka Bhide Dr Ashima Goyal Dr Rajiv Ranjan Dr Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth Prof Jayanth R Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution 17 The minutes of the MPCs meeting will be published on June 22 2023 18 The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during August 810 2023 Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent Statement by Dr Shashanka Bhide 19 Since the April meeting of the MPC the GDP growth numbers for FY 202223 have been updated and we also have the headline inflation numbers for April 2023 The official provisional estimates PE for GDP at constant prices place the GDP growth higher at 72 per cent for FY 202223 from 7 per cent in the Second Advance Estimates The headline YOY inflation rate in April dropped to 47 per cent well below the rate in March 57 per cent A significant part of the improvement in GDP in FY 202223 was due to the growth in Q4 FY 202223 at 61 per cent in comparison to the expectations of growth of 51 per cent implied by the overall growth rate of 7 per cent in SAE The better than anticipated growth in Q4 combined with the lower inflation reading for MarchApril reflect different sets of factors influencing growth and inflation 20 The global macroeconomic conditions have continued to be adverse reflecting slow growth momentum and moderating but elevated inflation pressures across economies In addition global trading opportunities have been limited by policies restricting supply chains The recent events have also pointed to the vulnerability of the banking and financial sectors to monetary and fiscal policy stances The energy markets experienced uncertainty in the face of global economic slowdown and the protracted Ukraine war The monetary policy measures aimed at curbing inflationary pressures in the major advanced and emerging market economies appear to be successful in moderating inflation rate although the rates remain well above the policy targets 21 This provides an overall context for an assessment of the likely course of growth and inflation in the short to medium term One important feature of GDP growth in 202223 and also 202122 was the dominance of Q1 compared to the other quarters As the pandemic induced sharp decline in GDP in Q1 of 202021 is offset by the subsequent growth growth in Q1202324 is likely to be closer to the growth across quarters A second feature of growth performance in 202223 is the uneven performance across sectors Manufacturing growth reflected in the growth of Gross Value Added GVA is placed at 13 per cent compared to the growth in construction 100 per cent or the services sector 95 per cent While the input cost pressures in 202223 appear to have had greater impact in the case of manufacturing than in the other sectors slower growth of consumption spending and investment would also have affected demand for manufacturing more than the others Finally the deceleration in export demand would affect manufacturing output Going forward reduction in cost pressures and overall inflation and revival of exports would be important in accelerating manufacturing growth The indicators compiled by RBI for listed manufacturing companies in Q4 202223 indicate significant improvement in profit margins with increased GVA growth and sustained improvement in capacity utilisation during the year are positive for the revival of manufacturing growth in 202324 However there are segments within manufacturing sector where weak export environment would be a concern 22 The services sector was the growth driver for the economy in 202223 Revival of demand in the service sectors badly hit during the pandemic has sustained the growth of the overall sector GVA growth in the subsector Trade Hotels Transportation and Broadcasting in 202223 is still only 41 per cent over its prepandemic level in 201920 with considerable upside potential of the subsector for growth The export of services is expected to be adversely affected by the global economic slowdown in 202324 23 In the case of agriculture and allied sectors GVA growth in 202223 turned out to be higher than 202122 although there were adverse weather effects during the year The normal monsoon forecast by the Indian Meteorological Department despite the emergence of the El Nino phenomenon would be supportive of agricultural growth 24 On the demand side of the economy RBIs recent sample surveys of households and enterprises indicate improving consumer sentiments and business outlook for 202324 The improvement is however in comparison to a period of weak sentiments through 202223 Early results of the enterprise surveys indicate greater optimism on the part of services and infrastructure firms on demand conditions than in the case of manufacturing The Consumer Confidence Survey of urban households conducted in May reflects steady improvement in confidence for the current period and strengthening optimism on oneyear ahead situation Expenditure expectations remain broadly stable with indications of increasing nonessential expenditure by the households While cost pressures are expected to moderate in Q1 the expectation of rising costs inputs financing and staff is still widely shared especially in Q2 Higher selling prices are seen to improve profit margin In the sectors where demand is buoyant transmission of higher costs to selling prices would be greater Overall perceptions on cost pressures and selling prices vary across sectors 25 The high frequency indicators for the recent period of AprilMay provide a mixed picture The urban and demand conditions show improvement PMIs for manufacturing and services reflect rising output However there are also mixed signs of transport activity Railway freight and port traffic and motor spirit sale show YOY growth rates of less than five per cent but Eway bills and toll collections continue to register double digit growth External trade has weakened in April Nonfood credit a broader measure of economic activity has increased by about 16 per cent during AprilMay 2023 26 The overall growth momentum for 202324 is expected to be more moderate than in 202223 The projections provided in the April meeting of the MPC hold over the improved official estimates for 202223 The GDP growth for 202324 is retained at 65 per cent YOY basis The quarterly YOY growth projections are Q1 80 per cent Q2 65 per cent Q3 60 per cent and Q4 57 per cent respectively The significant downside risks to growth are the unfavourable rainfall conditions during the monsoon season steeper than expected decline in global demand conditions and supply chain disruptions due to spillovers from the geopolitical conflicts As compared to the April forecast the quarterly growth rates in Q1 and Q2 are revised upward and Q3 and Q4 downward in the present set of projections RBIs Survey of Professional Forecasters provides a median forecast of 60 per cent for 202324 the same as in the previous round 27 The headline inflation rate YOY dropped further to below 5 per cent mark in April following the decline to below 6 per cent in March The rate of price rise fell in all three main categories of consumption basket food fuel and the core The decline was steeper in fuel and food than the core This broadbased decline in the inflation rate was also seen in March A number of factors have contributed to the significant decline in inflation rate in March and April deceleration in the commodity prices in the international markets decline in the inflation rates in the major economies although they remain well above the targets favourable base effects and the impact of monetary and policy measures on inflation directly and through their impact on inflation expectations RBIs recent Inflation Expectations Survey of Urban Households finds that along with the perceived current inflation rates the median expected inflation rate on a 3months ahead and oneyear ahead horizons is declining as compared to their levels in the previous round 28 Taking into account the current trends and assessment of factors influencing price trends RBIs projected average headline inflation rate for FY 202324 is 51 per cent with quarterly projections of 46 per cent in Q1 52 per cent in Q2 54 per cent in Q3 and 52 per cent in Q4 The projected inflation rate for FY 202324 is well below the rate of 67 per cent experienced in the previous year and close to the median forecast of 50 per cent for FY 202324 in the RBIs Survey of Professional Forecasters 29 However a few concerns remain on the question of sustainability of the trends seen in March and April headline inflation rate Several subcategories of consumption basket still register price rise of wellabove 6 per cent Price rise YOY basis in the case of cereals and products is in double digits and in milk and products above 8 per cent in March and April Clothing and footwear and Household goods and services also are at or above 6 per cent rate of price rise in March and April Among the broad groupings of items in the consumption basket excluding 1 Food and beverages 2 Pan tobacco and intoxicants and 3 Fuel and light items with YOY price rise of 6 per cent or more account for 45 per cent of the weight of this broad group The month over month change is higher in April as compared to March for several commodity groups although significant base effects have lowered the YOY headline inflation rate These issues require consideration in assessing the sustainability of moderating trend in headline inflation rate to the target of 4 per cent 30 The decline in the overall headline inflation in the recent two months combined with the strong growth performance in Q4 FY 202223 suggest a trajectory of lower YOY inflation of 5 per cent and GDP growth of above 6 per cent in FY 202324 The projected inflation rate is below the upper tolerance limit of 6 per cent but well above the target of 4 per cent There are also upside risks to inflation both on account of the evolution of sectoral price trends and developments at the global level The impact of increase in policy rate between May 2022 and April 2023 by 250 basis points and other economic policy measures have been crucial in anchoring price expectations As transmission of the policy changes through the economy to reach the inflation target is subject to unpredictable developments it is necessary to ensure that the policy framework is focused on achieving the inflation target while supporting growth 31 Accordingly I vote to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent and to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth Statement by Dr Ashima Goyal 32 Global uncertainty continues although its economic impact has been less severe than expected Major advanced economy AE central banks have slowed their tightening Inflation is softening although it continues to be above target They have shifted to a more databased approach and are more willing to wait for the lagged effects of past tightening Inflation has not been high for as long as it was in the seventies so there is less reason to fear persistence without higher for longer policy rates Labour markets remain tight but this may partly reflect labour hoarding by employers following the post Covid19 labour shortages so that tightness may be overestimated AE fiscal tightening has less global spillovers compared to monetary tightening so more AE fiscal consolidation may reduce pressures on monetary policy 33 Indian growth outperformed market expectations but did fall from 91 in FY22 to 72 in FY23 Some turnaround in manufacturing and continued growth in fixed investment in Q4FY23 augurs well for the future however Construction also remains robust but consumption and exports have areas of softness pent up demand for services may moderate and unemployment remains high 34 Inflation has moderated into the tolerance band but is not yet firmly on the path to target particularly in view of monsoon related uncertainties Even so it is clear that core inflation is neither persistent nor broadbased Core inflation fell from 62 in January to 51 in April this year Softening is to be expected in the absence of true second round effects from excess demand or from tight labour markets Inflation was higher for so long because of multiple supply shocks 35 Going ahead firms input output price gap is almost closed profit margins rose sharply in Q4FY23 input costs have fallen wage pressures are not there and since demand is slack they are unlikely to raise prices WPI inflation that has a larger weight of manufacturing prices is negative The IIM Ahmedabad business expectation survey shows a moderation in firms one year ahead price and cost inflation as well as sales expectations Preliminary results from the RBI enterprise surveys however show firms expecting price and cost inflation to rise despite actual costs and inflation softening This may be due to fears about the monsoon and bears watching over the next few months 36 The quick succession of repo rate raises has brought the real rate to near equilibrium levels which has prevented overheating as well as overtightening of demand and helped to anchor inflation expectations The slowdown and pause was also welltimed 37 It is necessary to build on the learning of the past few years where allowing sufficient nominal variation in repo and exchange rates to keep real rates near equilibrium has helped smooth shocks and sustain Indian growth resilience The experience has shown that independence from AE monetary cycles is feasible and foreign inflows are not tightly linked to the interest rate differential with AE rates Flexibility in inflation targeting intervention in FX markets to reduce excess volatility economic diversity supplyside action and good monetaryfiscal coordination under supply shocks have all contributed to better outcomes 38 As expected inflation falls however it is important that real repo rate does not rise too high This is what happened in 2015 as international oil prices fell damaging the economic cycle Research suggests that the inflation targeting regime has contributed to reducing inflation expectations Commitment to such a regime only involves aligning the nominal repo rate with expected inflation Such action together with the greater impact of official communication in emerging markets is adequate to bring inflation to target as the effect of shocks dies down It does not require the nominal repo to be kept higher for longer 39 But in this meeting it is appropriate for the MPC to pause I also vote for the present stance to continue since at present it is not possible to give a signal about future action The latter will be conditional on the data coming in The pause is only for the current meeting Moreover transient events have created a liquidity surplus so that withdrawal of liquidity itself is also required Statement by Prof Jayanth R Varma 40 The outlook on inflation and growth has changed only marginally between the April meeting and this meeting The two inflationary risks that I spoke about in April crude prices and the monsoon have become a little less worrisome On the crude oil front it is now clear that OPEC is struggling to reduce supply adequately to counter sluggish demand and the risk of a substantial spike in crude price in the near term is not very high As regards the monsoon the official forecast of a normal monsoon provides some comfort but it is tempered by the fact that the forecast includes an almost even chance of monsoon being below normal or worse Fortunately the forecast likelihood of a deficient monsoon is only marginally higher than the climatological probability and the chance of a drought appears to be rather remote This augurs well because the Indian economy is quite resilient to a monsoon which is somewhat below normal if its spatial and temporal distribution is satisfactory Another indication of a slight reduction in inflationary risks is the slight decline in the RBI projections of inflation for 202324 between the April and June meetings Similarly the outlook for growth remains more or less the same as in April with several high frequency indicators suggesting that growth is not as robust as we would like 41 Considering the balance of risks I vote for keeping the repo rate unchanged in this meeting I am of the view that the current level of the repo rate is high enough to keep inflation below the upper tolerance band on a sustained basis and also glide it towards the middle of the band However there are significant risks to both inflation and growth and the process of bringing inflation under control is still very much work in progress It would be premature to declare victory at this point of time based on the inflation prints of just a couple of months In this context I am not at all comfortable with the selfcongratulatory tone of the statement in the MPC Monetary Policy Statement that The MPC took note of the moderation in CPI headline inflation in MarchApril into the tolerance band in line with projections reflecting the combined impact of monetary tightening and supply augmenting measures 42 Turning to the stance I find that with every successive meeting this stance is becoming more and more disconnected from reality Based on the forecast inflation for 51 for 202324 the real repo rate is now almost 1 The real short term rate could well be above that level since in recent weeks many money market rates have often drifted towards the MSF rate of 675 In other words monetary policy is now dangerously close to levels at which it can inflict significant damage to the economy Despite this the majority of the MPC wishes to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation whatever that phrase might mean I have therefore seriously considered dissenting on this part of the resolution but after careful thought I have decided to confine myself to expressing reservations on it The main reason for not dissenting is that after two successive meetings at which the repo rate has been left unchanged this stance now appears more vestigial than a serious statement of intent Statement by Dr Rajiv Ranjan 43 The reasons outlined for a pause in rate action in my previous statement of April 2023 broadly hold for this meeting as well Moreover as the latest prints of growth and inflation indicate a Goldilocks scenario with growth higher and inflation marginally lower than anticipated this is telling us that our cumulative actions taken so far are working in the right direction It needs to be acknowledged however that knowing when to stop is hard The effects of tight policy will continue to percolate through the system months after the pause If policy makers continue tightening until inflation falls as much as they want they are likely to go farther than they need to Romer and Romer 20231 Notwithstanding this it is important that we do not drop our guard against inflation especially when we are still away from our primary goal of aligning inflation to the 40 per cent target 44 On the domestic growth front the optimism spelt out in my earlier minutes has materialised with the acceleration in real GDP growth for Q4202223 to 61 per cent from 45 per cent in the preceding quarter The quarteronquarter qoq seasonally adjusted momentum in Q4 at 29 per cent well above the prepandemic average of 17 per cent 201213 to 201920 bodes well for growth going forward Furthermore there are clear signs of economic activity holding up well in Q12023242 as indicated by various high frequency indicators and this optimism is expected to follow through in the remaining quarters of 202324 This stems from three factors i revival in rural consumption ii private corporate investment gaining steam and iii moderating drag from net external demand Let me elaborate Rural demand is supported by the robust rabi foodgrains production and expected normal monsoon3 Given the low share of agriculture in aggregate GVA around 15 per cent in 202223 and its contribution to GDP growth even if monsoon turns out be lower than normal its impact on growth may not be significant On the other hand deficient monsoon could have a more tangible impact on inflation due to the higher share of food items in the CPI consumption basket 45 There is an increasing revival in corporate investment due to slackening of input cost pressures and rising capacity utilisation Credit growth to industry has improved driven by large industries particularly roads steel cement construction petroleum and chemicals On the supply side manufacturing sector performance which turned positive in Q4202223 is likely to improve further with softening commodity prices normalisation of supply chains and production linked incentive PLI scheme gaining traction Manufacturing companies in several key sectors have expanded their fixed assets Services sector constituted about 63 per cent share in aggregate gross value added GVA and contributed around 83 per cent to growth in GVA during 202223 and is expected to remain the mainstay of growth in 202324 Higher contraction in merchandise imports coupled with buoyant services exports are improving net external demand 46 Headline CPI inflation fell sharply by 17 percentage points between February and April 2023 supported by favourable base effects and soft price momentum The softening in core inflation was seen across various exclusion based as well as trimmed mean measures CPI diffusion indices indicate that a majority of the CPI items saw price increases less than a seasonally adjusted annualised rate SAAR of 6 per cent during MarchApril 2023 a significant reversal from February All these suggest some waning of price pressures in CPI in recent months as the impact of monetary policy actions supply side measures and easing of global commodity prices played through Inflation however is likely to remain well above the target rate of 4 per cent throughout the year 47 We have been prudent in our approach using the flexibility imbedded in the framework to operate within the tolerance band in balancing macroeconomic priorities depending upon the need of the hour With greater clarity on macro fronts prudence requires that we now focus on aligning inflation to the target of 4 per cent Time is opportune to emphasise the distinction between the inflation target and tolerance of deviations from the target The tolerance band can be conceptually broken down into an uncertainty range4 owing to imperfect knowledge of the present and future state of the economy the indifference range over which monetary policy is not expected to react and finally the operational range that allows for intentional deviations to exercise shortrun tradeoffs between inflation and growth Chung et al 20205 Sustained deviations of inflation from the target may lead to a steady drift of inflation expectations The risk of ceding part of the operational range to the indifference range makes it imperative to emphasise the primacy of the 4 per cent inflation target This is crucial to support the ongoing process of anchoring inflation expectations around the target Moreover real policy rate continues to be positive which will further anchor inflation expectations 48 The rate pause in April seems to have had a sobering impact on domestic financial conditions For instance the average spread of the 10year Gsec yield over the 1year Gsec 91day Treasury bills and the policy repo rate moderated to 20 bps 29 bps and 58 bps respectively during April 6June 7 2023 In the credit market the weighted average lending rate WALR on fresh rupee loans and the weighted average domestic term deposit rate WADTDR on fresh deposits of scheduled commercial banks fell by 23 bps and 12 bps respectively in April 2023 Such an easing of financial conditions occurred even as the MPC had unequivocally argued that the pause was specific to the April policy and not a policy pivot Accordingly continuity in the stance with a clearcut objective of aligning inflation to the 4 per cent target is important Any premature change in stance may be hasty and could undo the hard work done so far It may also tamper with the transmission process that is currently underway Recent actions of some advanced economies reverting back to rate hikes after a pause need to be kept in mind Thus I vote for a pause in rate action and continuity of stance Monetary policy actions would need to be calibrated carefully by assessing the impact of past actions meticulously scrutinising the incoming data and responding appropriately to the evolving macroeconomic conditions Statement by Dr Michael Debabrata Patra 49 Macroeconomic outcomes have broadly evolved along projected paths vindicating the April 2023 monetary policy decision and stance This provides elbow room to reassess the evolving outlook with information gleaned from current rounds of forwardlooking surveys and updated forecasts of goal variables while keeping in mind the cumulative actions already taken and the lags of monetary policys effects on the economy 50 Overall the outlook for real GDP growth in India is brighter than in April Global risks appear contained for now but idiosyncratic monsoonrelated risks have risen and need to be seen off over the ensuing months Financial conditions have eased considerably and domestic financial markets are reflecting a stable growth outlook along with reanchoring of inflation expectations 51 The nearterm outlook for inflation is also relatively benign visavis the 202223 experience Beyond the first quarter however pressure points emanating from specific supplydemand mismatches could impart upward pressure to the momentum of prices and offset favourable base effects especially in the second half of 202324 Hence monetary policy needs to remain in brace mode ensuring that the effects of these shocks dissipate without leaving scars on the economy 52 Accordingly my vote for maintaining status quo on the policy rate should be seen as taking middle stump guard to prepare for a bouncier pitch Holding the rate unchanged should not be interpreted as the interest rate cycle having peaked but as a period of careful evaluation of a decision on the extent of additional policy tightening if needed This is a part of continuous learning about the underlying structure of the economy with new information until the next meeting of the MPC and not a prolonged pause Headline inflation is edging down towards the target but it is still well above it and the balance of risks suggests that it will go up in coming months before it comes down Therefore continuing with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation is appropriate as it adequately conveys the future course of interest rates in the economy Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das 53 The global economy has sustained the growth momentum and the overall uncertainty is somewhat receding Nevertheless headwinds to global growth outlook persist The geopolitical conflict continues unabated Headline inflation across countries is on a downward trajectory but is still high and above their respective targets Central banks remain on high alert and watchful of the evolving conditions 54 Indias macroeconomic fundamentals are strengthening and growth prospects are steadily improving and becoming broadbased Inflation has eased and the external sector outlook has improved Balance sheets of banks and corporates look resilient and healthy thereby engendering twin balance sheet advantage for growth Demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving rural demand and investment activity Urban demand remains strong Consumer and business outlook surveys display continued optimism Overall the Indian economy presents a story of resilience and sustainability with an expected real GDP growth of 65 per cent in 202324 Macroeconomic and financial stability is now well entrenched and needs to be nurtured and preserved with well calibrated and timely actions 55 The inflation trajectory has seen significant softening during MarchApril 2023 as anticipated with the nearterm outlook turning out to be more favourable than envisaged earlier Inflation is now projected to average 51 per cent in 202324 compared to 67 per cent in 202223 but this would still be above the target The disinflation towards the target rate of 4 per cent is likely to be gradual and protracted Compared to April uncertainties on the inflation outlook for H2202324 have not abated The spatial and temporal distribution of the southwest monsoon in the backdrop of a likely El Nino weather pattern needs to be watched carefully especially for its impact on food prices International prices for key food items like rice and sugar are at elevated levels Adverse climate events have the potential to quickly change the direction of the inflation trajectory Geopolitical tensions uncertainty on crude price trajectory and volatile financial markets pose further upside risks to prices These considerations warrant close monitoring of the evolving price dynamics 56 The pause in April MPC was based on the need to assess the cumulative impact of 250 bps rate hike over the past one year Our surveys indicate that anchoring of expectations is underway and our monetary policy actions are yielding the desired results Given the baseline inflation projections for 202324 positive real policy rates will aid the ongoing disinflation process The full impact of past actions is still unfolding In this situation a pause in the rate hike cycle and closely assessing the evolving situation looks the most appropriate option for this meeting of the MPC Accordingly I vote for keeping the policy rate unchanged in this meeting of the MPC 57 Our job is only half done having brought inflation within the target band Our fight against inflation is not yet over We need to undertake forwardlooking assessment of the evolving inflationgrowth outlook and stand ready to act if situation so warrants Beyond this and given the prevailing uncertainties it is difficult to give any definitive forward guidance about our future course of action in a rate tightening cycle 58 I also vote to continue with the stance of withdrawal of accommodation given that liquidity in the banking system is still in surplus and we have a way to go to align headline inflation with 40 per cent target on a durable basis and ensure that the overall financial conditions are in sync with the monetary policy stance We will continue to remain agile and flexible in managing liquidity through twoway operations We do recognise that durable price and financial stability are mutually reinforcing and necessitate greater policy focus at the current juncture Our future actions will be shaped accordingly Yogesh Dayal Chief General Manager Press Release 20232024449 1 Romer CD and David H Romer 2023 Does Monetary Policy Matter The Narrative

Governor Reserve Bank of India Shri M K Jain Deputy Governor Reserve Bank of India Dr Michael D Patra Deputy Governor Reserve Bank of India Shri M Rajeshwar Rao Deputy Governor Reserve Bank of India Shri T Rabi Sankar Deputy Governor Reserve Bank of India Dr O P Mall Executive Director Reserve Bank of India Dr Rajiv Ranjan Executive Director Reserve Bank of India Moderator Shri Yogesh Dayal Chief General Manager Reserve Bank of India Yogesh DayalWelcome to the postMonetary Policy press conference Today we have Governor Shri Shaktikanta Das Deputy Governors Shri M K Jain Dr Michael D Patra Shri M Rajeshwar Rao Shri T Rabi Sankar and we have Executive Directors Dr O P Mall and Dr Rajiv Ranjan along with my colleague Muneesh Kapoor I welcome all of you to this press conference and without much ado let me begin by inviting the Governor to make opening remarks and then we will go ahead by taking your questions one by one Shaktikanta Das Thank you Yogesh By way of opening remarks I have six points to make The first point is that the rate in this meeting of the MPC is obviously a pause Future action will depend on the evolving situation Secondly the headline inflation has eased and so also all its components But there is no room for complacency The MPC remains resolutely focused on the 4 inflation target in the interest of sustainable growth Thirdly the Indian economy presents a story of resilience with macroeconomic and financial stability Prospects for growth are steadily improving and becoming broadbased Fourthly the healthy twin balance sheets of banks and corporates also augur well for GDP growth Fifthly the external sector is eminently viable as reflected in the current account deficit situation stability of the Indian rupee and buildup of foreign exchange reserves Finally the Reserve Banks liquidity management will be nimble and twosided as per requirement and as demonstrated in our recent actions Thank you Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will begin the press conference by inviting Shri Jeevan Bhawasar from Akashvani Jeevan Bhawasar Akashvani Good afternoon Sir I would like to know by when can we expect the public launch of the CBDC and by when the common people would start using the CBDC Shaktikanta Das Deputy Governor Rabi Sankar may please answer this question T Rabi Sankar Thank you Governor We are not planning by keeping any specific date in our minds We have said earlier also that it will be gradual and calibrated because we would like to assess the impact first and then we will go ahead with the policy of learn as we go As of now our plan is that there should be one million customers by the endJune 2023 Secondly we are planning to have its interoperability with the UPIQR code Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir Now I will move to Piyush Shukla from the Financial Express Piyush Shukla The Financial Express Good afternoon Governor Just wanted your perspective on the SBI moving to the Supreme Court seeking clarification on fraud classification The Supreme Court had issued some notice regarding that because some of the banks have stopped marking accounts as fraud They are waiting for more clarity from the RBI Is the RBI going to issue a detailed report on fraud classification Secondly Sir you had said that foreign countries with excess Rupee balance can invest in Gsec and Tbills so actually what is the amount that has been invested by foreign countries Shaktikanta Das The international settlement of trade in Rupee through the arrangement of Rupee VOSTRO accounts the process has already started As regards investment in Indian securities or bonds etc being the first time the central banks as well as the banks on the other side are seeking some further clarity through bilateral discussions It is under discussion with them and we expect the process to begin soon With regard to fraud classification I would request Deputy Governor Shri Jain to take that question M K Jain As you are aware that the Supreme Court has given its judgment that natural justice has to be provided to the borrower before declaring the fraud and subsequently SBI filed the review petition The Supreme Court has clarified that there is no need for giving a personal hearing while they are allowed to file a review petition for the remaining part of the SBI So we are reviewing the entire guidelines on fraud and we will come out with our guidelines very shortly in consultation with various stakeholders Nevertheless the Supreme Court judgement is applicable to all regulated entities irrespective of the RBIs guidelines Piyush Shukla Financial Express By when can we expect this circular to come out M K Jain Very shortly Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sirs I will move on to Ms Latha Venkatesh from CNBC TV18 Latha Venkatesh CNBC TV18 This is regarding the withdrawal of 2000 notes How much has come back so far How much of it was exchanged and how much of it came as deposits Shaktikanta Das As on March 31 2023 there was a total of 362 lakh crore of 2000 notes in circulation After the announcement of withdrawal so far about 18 lakh crore of 2000 notes have come back which is roughly about half of the 2000 notes in circulation as on March 31 2023 Regarding how much of them through exchange and how much through deposits requires reconciliation because we find that there is some amount of overlap in reporting and we want to avoid any possibility of double counting However broadly on a provisional basis I can say that about 85 of the 2000 notes have come back as deposits into bank accounts Let me also take this opportunity to say that more or less this is in line with our expectations and the good thing is that there has not been any rush in any of the banks Going forward I would appeal through you to everyone that not to rush or not to go to the bank in a panic go whenever you are free and take your time But at the same time I would make one more request generally the habit is we do things at the last moment so please avoid last minute rush in the last 1015 days of September Further for wider dissemination I will like to request in Hindi 2000 30 10 15 panic rush Thank you Latha Venkatesh CNBC TV18 Sir my next question is on liquidity There seems to be a greater willingness to do VRRRs that is the removal of liquidity and a slight hesitation in doing Repo auctions which is giving liquidity So should we understand that the RBI would be happier if the weighted average call rate lay between 65 to 675 I mean the comfort is more if it is higher and not as much when it is lower Considering that banks also have been hesitant as you say that they are very cautious about giving you money in VRRR will you look for more enduring ways like an OMO purchases or something like that Shaktikanta Das The target of the Monetary Policy is the Policy Repo Rate which is 65 What we would like to see is that the overnight call rates are also aligned to 65 Beyond that it is a function of daytoday fluctuation or weektoweek fluctuation in the overall liquidity situation So we expect and would like the overnight call rates to be aligned with policy rate Whether there is a preference for VRR or VRRR that depends on the prevailing situation in the market As we have done over the last four days we will remain nimble and remain flexible and act swiftly I have also said in my statement and also mentioned in my opening remarks that we will do twosided operations as per requirement Latha Venkatesh CNBC TV18 Other than Repo it seems that the banks have been cautious will you look for other instruments Shaktikanta Das As and when we decide you will know But banks have been cautious and let me make also one point There is still some amount of liquidity sitting there When we say banks are cautious let us remember that about 15 lakh crore have been mopped up through VRRR operations Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will move on to Mr Govardhan Rangan from the Economic Times M Govardhan Rangan The Economic Times On the liquidity issue there is a feeling that the entire liquidity dynamics have changed in the last few months because of the 24x7 payments The 1 of NDTL that used to be a case that it may have to be relooked at and you also mentioned in your speech that banks are cautious How do you address this is there a need for a policy overhaul or a need to relook at that Shaktikanta Das I would request Deputy Governor Michael Patra to take that question Michael D Patra It is true that there are payments transaction going through till the middle of the night But as banks get used to this the liquidity is balancing out We saw there was a lot of tightness in the middle of May but after that there has been an easing of liquidity So banks are slowly getting used to those transactions coming in late and in any case after 530 pm we have standing windows open and a SISO facility which will sweep in and sweep out So banks are not inconvenienced by it M Govardhan Rangan Economic Times Just on that because the banks are getting used to it they are also feeling that neutral liquidity itself will be a kind of surplus of 6070000 crore The depreciation of the neutral itself is getting redefined Is that the case Michael D Patra No we abandon that quantitative ceiling Right now we look at the call money rate and look at it to get aligned with the Repo Rate As soon as it gets aligned we feel liquidity is balanced out Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sirs I will move on to Mr Manojit Saha from Business Standard Manojit Saha Business Standard The Reserve Bank released the list of online FOREX platforms last evening which are unauthorised Earlier also there was a list but those applications are still there in the Google Play Store and all Is there any further steps the RBI is contemplating to curb those issues Shaktikanta Das Dr Patra you can take that question Michael D Patra You are right that we issued a list yesterday So there is a twopronged approach to this One is to build up levels of awareness and for that purpose the RBI not only issues those lists which say unauthorised but we also give you a list of authorised platforms The other thing that we do is that we interact very closely with the enforcement agencies and the Ministries like Information Technology and Finance and they are taking action on an ongoing basis We are already hearing of various platforms being raided and assets seized So action is taking place there The third line of action should be that the tech companies which are uploading those mobile apps should apply caution and ensure that what they are uploading is by the laws of the land Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sirs I will move on to Ms Swati Khandelwal from Zee Business Swati Khandelwal Zee Business The withdrawal of 2000 notes was a big move by the RBI since the last Monetary Policy announcement Everybody was taken by surprise and of course you have responded to that This is on behalf of our consumers who watch us and ask us that will the RBI issue a new 1000 note and whether 500 note will also see the same fate as the 2000 notes What do you want to say to the people who have such questions and what is the RBI thinking on those lines Shaktikanta Das You asked whether we are going to introduce 1000 notes or are we going to withdraw the 500 note I do not have any information on all these issues and we are not thinking along those lines Therefore please do not do any sort of speculation in the market I would like to say to the general public through you not to speculate As of now I have no information and we do not have any such idea Swati Khandelwal Zee Business Thank you Sir It was an important clarification Now I have a question about ECL The thought process regarding expected credit loss is that the banks are thinking it would be implemented by June 30 2023 Is it correct and what is the situation at this moment If you can give an update on what is the Finance Ministrys view on it perhaps there is no consensus between the RBI and the Finance Ministry on that so is that correct or not Shaktikanta Das What is going on between the RBI and Finance Ministry even I am not aware but I will request Deputy Governor Rajeshwar Rao to take that question M Rajeshwar Rao We have received comments from all the concerned stakeholders Those comments are being evaluated Some more refinements and work are being done At this point in time it is not correct to infer that June 30th would be the date when it is going to be launched That is an absolutely incorrect assumption I will stop it with that Swati Khandelwal Zee Business Can you give us a date Shaktikanta Das No you look at our track record What is our track record over the last few years We give the time for compliance It is not that today we announce something and from tomorrow introduce those regulatory guidelines We will give sufficient time to the bank to implement the ECL If you see over the last few years whenever we issue any new guideline we give time to the banks to introduce from a particular date I would like to say that there is no need to create any panic or anything about the ECL also As the Deputy Governor has pointed out comments have been received They are under examination and we will issue the circular but we are mindful of the fact that the banks will need some time to implement it Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will move on to Mr Anup Roy from Bloomberg Anup Roy Bloomberg Thank you Sir Sir why not change the stance to neutral and have you pivoted Last time you stressed that this is a pause not a pivot but this time you did not mention that so should we interpret it as a pivot Shaktikanta Das I would mention only if there were a change So it is a pause in this meeting of the MPC and I have not said anything about the pivot so whatever I said in the last meeting that it is not a pivot I reiterate that Yogesh Dayal Thank you We will move to Mr Ankur Mishra from ET Now Ankur Mishra ET Now Good afternoon Governor I want to ask regarding the stance you have said in your speech that often it is said that in the end it becomes a little difficult and then hence you have mentioned that future actions will be based on evolving situations But as per your assessment only you have said that the situation has improved from the last time be it integrators or other things So again how should we infer that not mentioning of exact word of the pivot it is not what you have mentioned but you believe that it is we are much closer to the change in stance than we were last time Shaktikanta Das I have said in my statement and that is the MPCs view also that our target is 4 So our effort will also be to align all our actions to move towards that target and reach the target It will therefore depend on the evolving situation Given the kind of uncertainties which still persist and I have listed them out in my statement to say anything other than what I have said our endeavour is to align the inflation target to 4 we will move towards 4 and we will be very watchful of the evolving situation and modulate our action suitably is not desirable About a year ago also we have said that given the high uncertainty which is prevailing all over not just in India particularly in the external sector and especially when we are in a tightening cycle it is not desirable to give any forward guidance because that may create expectations which may not be aligned with our thinking or our action Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will move on to Ms Swati Bhat Shetye from Reuters Swati Bhat Shetye Reuters I have a twopart question first is apart from a slowdown in growth what would be the other factors that would prompt the MPC to start cutting rates Is there a level of real rate which will make it restrictive for the economy to keep growing Secondly there are expectations that the US Fed could continue to keep hiking rates so is the RBI comfortable with a rising interest rate differential with the Fed Shaktikanta Das I will ask Deputy Governor Dr Patra to reply to this question but one point I would like to mention that our monetary policy actions as I have been saying time and again are determined primarily by domestic conditions We do not look at the action of other central banks to determine our actions But yes we do watch what other central banks are doing because that will have an impact on the financial sector situation on currency markets and other aspects but our actions are determined primarily by our domestic factors Michael D Patra We have described to you what exactly our comfort zone is and that is when inflation aligns with a target and growth returns to potential after the shock it received from the pandemic Both are works in progress There is little better progress on the growth front inflation is also progressing towards our goal but not as fast as growth is normalising So we look at both to take the next step Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sirs I will move on to Mr Mayur Shetty from The Times of India Mayur Shetty The Times of India Governor Sir recently the Kanungo Committee had submitted a recommendation on customer service standards So I wanted to know how would these standards be enforced and in that context there were two incidences that videos which were circulating on social media one was of a bank manager pushing the staff to sell insurance policies instead of the needbased selling that the RBI requires and the other is of regulated entity saying that if people who do not want to be disturbed and if they want to opt out of our calls then they should not come back for loans in future So whether such issues would get addressed M K Jain Let me respond about the Kanungo Committee report we have put out on our website for public comments By and large this Committee has focused on the adequacy of a regulatory and institutional framework the customer experience the efficacy of grievance redressal extent of customer education and awareness These are the five areas where they have focused We will wait for public comments and thereafter we will decide what can be implemented and what cannot be implemented On the calls basically as far as recovery agents are concerned we have already issued our guidelines and we have put out our code that what they have to follow for the recovery agents For the marketing calls this is the decision of the individual banks and the TRAI has to look into if there is a Do not Registry done by any customers Nevertheless this issue which you have brought it out will be examined separately Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will move to Ms Gopika Gopakumar from the Mint Gopika Gopakumar Mint Sir at the time of demonetisation the RBI had introduced an incremental CRR do you think that is required at this point in time and secondly do you think after SEBI will the RBI also be coming out with regulations or financial influencers Shaktikanta Das So far as financial influencers are concerned we have no such thinking SEBI is already dealing with it We have no such thinking in the RBI to get into that territory With regard to the incremental CRR that will depend on the situation I do not want to speculate what action we will take but just keep in mind that we have mopped up 15 lakh crore through our VRRR auctions and that process is already We will see going forward Yogesh Dayal Sir I will now invite Mr Pankaj Aher from Informist Media to ask his question Pankaj Aher Informist Media Thank you Sir There is a big difference between the earlier policy statements and this one in the fact that the earlier policy statement spoke predominantly about the flexibility of the inflation target Today you have been very clear that 4 is the target It has been a while since we heard that I would like to know a bit more about that Does the market now take it that rate cut potentially or a stance change is on the table only when inflation reaches is 4 Shaktikanta Das What I have said is that our target and our endeavour will be to see that the inflation aligns with the target on a durable basis Let me clarify Our effort is to ensure that the actual CPI headline inflation alliance with the targets on a durable basis not a oneoff basis at any point of time With regard to the band and specific target the specific and primary target of monetary policy is 4 During the stressful times of COVID and thereafter when the Ukraine War broke out and the fallout of the Ukraine War we operated within the band We use the flexibility which is available to the Monetary Policy Committee We operated within that band We were tolerant of inflation above 4 and our effort and focus was to remain within the target band Now the situation has changed There is now greater certainly and I have mentioned it in my opening lines also The overall path is much clearer than it was earlier So we are now targeting 4 which is our primary target Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir I will now invite Mr Vishwanath Nair from BQ Prime Vishwanath Nair BQ Prime Governor I am coming back to the liquidity question because that is an important issue at this point of time You are talking about 15 lakh crore mop up from the system through VRRR Your auction was like 45 lakh crore if we put all the auctions together I am just trying to understand what is the reason for this caution among banks Secondly if you look at the way the interest rates lending rates and deposit rates are panning out in the system The RBI data suggest that in April fresh loan and fresh deposit rates have fallen by 20 basis points which is a marginal fall But still at a time when you are talking about status quo rates falling may not go well for transmission Michael D Patra The reason for caution among banks is that there is an eminent advance tax outflow which is always sizable that will happen in the next week So they are holding back money for that purpose But as you saw we were persevering in our efforts and the fact that we repeated our auctions indicated our purpose which is what we wanted to convey It was important therefore to withdraw that excess liquidity so that the deposit rate and lending rate shuffling that was happening was more aligned with what the interest rate cycle is and that is why we have withdrawn 15 lakh crore so far As Governor pointed out that is exactly why we withdrew liquidity Shaktikanta Das It is necessary that any segment of the market does not prematurely assume certain things and then start cutting rates Whether it is a lending rate or deposit rate It is a commercial decision as you know that both deposit rates and lending rates are all deregulated banks are free to do it But if they are doing it on the assumption of a certain action which is likely to be taken by the RBI that would be wrong and as Deputy Governor clarified our liquidity action also should be seen in the context that our Monetary Policy stance and our policy rate are wellaligned with the interest rates which are prevailing in the market including banks Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sirs I will request Anshika Kayastha from The Hindu Business Line to go ahead Anshika Kayastha The Hindu Business Line Sir has the framework for settlement and writeoff been triggered by the huge amount of writeoffs that we saw postCOVID and is the RBI concerned because the recoveries from writtenoff accounts have been underwhelming so far Secondly the RBI is looking to issue FLDG guidelines but to understand what were the points of contention till now and what is direction the RBI is looking in now Shaktikanta Das On FLDG guidelines you will have to wait for the circular it will come out very shortly and on the other component about compliance etc I would request Deputy Governor Rajeshwar Rao to take that question M Rajeshwar Rao It is not correct to infer that the writeoffs have triggered the issue of a compromise settlement Essentially what we have done is rationalise the existing framework for compromise settlements These instructions were issued across several circulars at different points in time and they have now been brought in one place and enabled What is more significant is this has been extended to the urban cooperative banks also which was not there hitherto This is the basic change and that is what has been done nothing more than that Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir Now I will invite Anurag Shah from ET Now Swadesh Anurag Shah ET Now Swadesh The insurance sector is growing very fast and the Government also wanted to increase the penetration of insurance The insurance industry has been demanding a separate regulation on insurance premium financing as it is there on home loans and auto loans Is the RBI thinking about this as this will be a new avenue for financial institutions and the way there has been changes in the technology it can be implemented very well M Rajeshwar Rao Credit decisions are decided by the banks based on boardapproved policy There is no specific guideline of the RBI and insurance premium financing is one of the financial products and bank has to take a decision based on potential and there is no guideline of the RBI Anurag Shah ET Now Swadesh Sir many people have complained that those who have no credit footprint do not get an easy loan For example in a couple the husband uses a credit card so he is getting a loan offered and the rates are also less but the wife has maintained financial discipline and never taken any credit so she is not getting any loan and if she is getting that too at very expensive rate How do we copeup with that in that continuation somebody is maintaining a good credit score for the last 2025 years but because of a mistake of a financial institution and because of missselling it is getting defaulted and in return his score gets impacted so in this what is the view of the RBI M Rajeshwar Rao I have said earlier also that the credit decision is based on the banks internal board approved policy Regarding the issues of credit history the RBI has issued guidelines in 2014 which says that credit history should not be the only factor while taking a credit decision for firsttime borrowers and first time borrowers should not be denied access to credit just because they have no credit history It is one of the best practices recommended by the RBI way back in 2014 Regarding the second question on the wrong credit history I would like to tell you that the credit information companies have been brought under RBI Ombudsman Scheme in August last year Further we have issued a guideline to CIC in October that an internal Ombudsman should also be appointed We have a guideline that CICs and banks should correct the errors in credit history within 30 days and if they do not rectify then one can complain to the internal Ombudsman of CIC or the RBI Ombudsman regarding the same Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir Now I invite Hitesh Vyas from The India Express to ask his question Hitesh Vyas The Indian Express Sir what will be the impact of the MSP hike on inflation and whether it has been factored into your revised projection currently Michael D Patra We got the MSP data yesterday and we find that the average increase across all crops is about 75 to 8 So over and above our projections this will have impact to the extent of 10 to 12 basis points Shaktikanta Das Part of the hike is already built into our projections going by the past years So it will be another 10 or 12 basis points that is the quick calculations we have done overnight Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sirs Now I invite Mr Sachin Kumar from The New Indian Express Sachin Kumar The New Indian Express Sir you mentioned that your target is to bring inflation to 4 Given this is it safe to assume that now there will be no rate cut in the current fiscal and secondly it is regarding 2000 notes There are many NRIs who are outside and they may not be able to come back by that deadline So do you have some thinking to extend that date so that their problem can be addressed Shaktikanta Das I replied to this specific point on May 22 2023 in a media interaction I had specifically said that we are aware that at an individual level or at a group level there could be problems There are Indians who are travelling abroad and many of them stay with their children for very long periods There are Indians who are H1B Visa holders and live abroad They may have left behind a certain 2000 notes We are sensitive to all those representations which we keep getting We will examine them and do whatever is required but our endeavour will be to see that nobody is put into any inconvenience We want to see that the whole process goes very smoothly and so far you have seen it is going very smoothly With regard to inflation I thought I have replied to that Deputy Governor Michael Patra can add anything in his language Michael D Patra Governor was very categorical about what will the future look like One thing he has kept on stressing is that we were looking at inflation aligning with the target not with the inflation at target Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sirs I will move on to Mr Benn Jose from PTI Benn Jose PTI In Kerala there were reports not in the mainstream but in online media and some TV channels that hundreds of customers of Federal Banks were facing problems wherein after UPI payment may be a small amount even a chai amount paying for a tea their account gets completely blocked and when they walk into the bank the bank refuses and the answer they get is that the police from Bihar or Chhattisgarh or Haryana have asked the banker to block their account They freeze their account and they cannot do any transactions There are some middlemen engaging and it is phishing and police ask for lakhs of rupees to reopen their account Shaktikanta Das Deputy Governor Rabi Sankar can respond T Rabi Sankar Offhand there is no reason I can think of why an account should be blocked after the transaction If it is happening it is happening because of like you are saying police is getting involved for law enforcement reasons then we will have to look into that and we will have to find out If it is happening because of some problem at the bank end then if these issues come to our notice we will look into that as well Shaktikanta Das This problem so far which you are referring to has not come to our notice As and when it comes to our notice we will find out through our sources if there is any such problem and we will examine it and we will deal with it Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sirs I will take the last question from Manish Suvarna from Moneycontrol Manish Suvarna Moneycontrol Sir do you think the repo rate at 65 is appropriate to sustain growth in the long run second what is the status of that the RBI centralised portal for unclaimed deposits Shaktikanta Das So the first part of the question Deputy Governor Dr Patra can take and the portal Deputy Governor Rajeshwar Rao can reply Michael D Patra The rate of 65 is adjudged to be appropriate at this point of time and as and when we have new information or a new outlook on the growth we will take a new view on the rate M Rajeshwar Rao The work on the portal and software development etc is going on and as soon as it is ready we will launch it Latha Venkatesh CNBC TV18 I have one question the market wanted to know after all the last two numbers came down because of a fall in core inflation you do not see that momentum in the second half because the reduction in the forecast was a little less than what others arithmetically arrived that So if you are not confident that the way core fell in the second half you could expect a lower inflation Shaktikanta Das There is a momentum but we would like to see sustained momentum not oneoff There are still uncertainties How the distribution and the timing of the monsoon the spatial and temporal distribution of monsoon as I mentioned there is also a forecast of a EL Nino With so many uncertainties our assessment gave these numbers We would like to see a sustained momentum towards the alignment of inflation with the headline targets Manojit Saha Business Standard Will the RBI recommend to the government to withdraw the legal status of 2000 note after September 30 Shaktikanta Das To my knowledge there is no such idea Yogesh Dayal Thank you Sir With this we come to the conclusion of todays press conference Thank you everyone for joining the press conference I thank the top management of the Reserve Bank led by respected Governor Shri Shaktikanta Das and Deputy Governors along with Executive Directors and thank all media friends for making it here and for a very conducive press conference Till next time thank you so much and take care Shaktikanta Das Thank you
https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=55816,Date Governors Statement June 8 2023,As I make this monetary policy statement we can derive satisfaction from the fact that the Indian economy and the financial sector stand out as strong and resilient in a world of unprecedented headwinds and swift cross currents Unlike the previous three tumultuous years the uncertainty on the horizon appears comparatively less and the path ahead somewhat clearer but we have to be acutely aware that the geopolitical conflict continues unabated and policy normalisation globally is far from complete Headline inflation across countries is on a downward trajectory but is still high and above the targets Labour markets are tight and demand is rotating back from goods to services Hence central banks across the world remain on high alert and watchful of the evolving conditions even though many of them have tempered their rate hikes or taken a pause Financial stability concerns persist in advanced economies although they appear to have been contained due to resolute actions Retrenchment in trade technology and capital flows caused by geopolitical fault lines and economic fragmentation further complicate the situation 2 In these challenging times the Reserve Bank of India has continued to focus on preserving price and financial stability while ensuring adequate flow of financial resources to all productive sectors of the economy As a result domestic macroeconomic fundamentals are strengthening economic activity is exhibiting resilience inflation has moderated the current account deficit has narrowed and foreign exchange reserves are comfortable Fiscal consolidation is also ongoing The Indian banking system remains stable and resilient credit growth is robust and domestic financial markets have evolved in an orderly manner Decisions and Deliberations of the Monetary Policy Committee MPC 3 The Monetary Policy Committee MPC met on 6th 7th and 8th June 2023 Based on an assessment of the macroeconomic situation and the outlook the MPC decided unanimously to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent Consequently the standing deposit facility SDF rate remains at 625 per cent and the marginal standing facility MSF rate and the Bank Rate at 675 per cent The MPC also decided by a majority of 5 out of 6 members to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth 4 Let me now explain the MPCs rationale for these decisions on the policy rate and the stance The MPC recognised that the pace of global economic activity is expected to decelerate in 2023 dragged down by elevated inflation tight financial conditions and geopolitical tensions The pace of monetary tightening has slowed in recent months but uncertainty remains on its future trajectory as inflation continues to rule above targets across the world 5 In India consumer price inflation eased during MarchApril 2023 and moved into the tolerance band declining from 67 per cent in 202223 Headline inflation however is still above the target as per the latest data and is expected to remain so according to our projections for 202324 Therefore close and continued vigil on the evolving inflation outlook is absolutely necessary especially as the monsoon outlook and the impact of El Nino remain uncertain Real GDP growth in 202223 on the other hand turned out to be stronger than anticipated and is holding up well 6 The policy repo rate has been increased by 250 basis points since May 2022 and is still working its way through the system Its fuller effects will be seen in the coming months Against this backdrop the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent The MPC will continue to remain vigilant on the evolving inflation and growth outlook It will take further monetary actions promptly and appropriately as required to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored and bring down inflation to the target 7 With the policy repo rate at 650 per cent and full year projected inflation for 202324 at just a little above 5 per cent the real policy rate continues to be positive The average system liquidity however is still in surplus mode and could increase as 2000 banknotes get deposited in the banks Headline inflation as noted before is easing but rules above the target warranting close monitoring of the evolving price dynamics Taking all of these factors into account the MPC decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth Assessment of Growth and Inflation Growth 8 Indias real gross domestic product GDP recorded a growth of 72 per cent in 202223 stronger than the earlier estimate of 70 per cent It has surpassed its prepandemic level by 101 per cent Real GDP growth in Q4202223 accelerated to 61 per cent yoy from 45 per cent in Q3 aided by fixed investment and higher net exports On the supply side real gross value added GVA accelerated from 47 per cent in Q3 to 65 per cent in Q4 driven by rebound in manufacturing activity which moved into expansion territory after two quarters of contraction 9 Turning to 202324 domestic demand conditions remain supportive of growth on the back of improving household consumption and investment activity Urban demand remains resilient with indicators such as passenger vehicle sales domestic air passenger traffic and credit cards outstanding posting doubledigit expansion on a yearonyear basis in April Rural demand is also on a revival path motorcycle and threewheeler sales increased at a robust pace yoy in April while tractor sales remained subdued 10 Growth in steel consumption cement output and production and imports of capital goods suggest continued buoyancy in investment activity On the back of doubledigit growth of 156 per cent in nonfood bank credit the flow of resources to the commercial sector in 202324 up to May 19 2023 increased to 27 lakh crore from 10 lakh crore during the same period last year Fixed investment by manufacturing companies expanded in 202223 reversing the contraction seen in 202122 Our surveys also point towards higher investment intentions of manufacturing companies for 202324 The contraction in merchandise imports outpaced that of merchandise exports in April resulting in a narrowing of the trade deficit Coupled with the sustained and strong growth in services exports the drag from net exports on growth is easing 11 On the supply side the eight core industries output expanded by 35 per cent yoy in April 2023 as compared with 36 per cent in March 2023 The purchasing managers index PMI for manufacturing exhibited sustained expansion rising to 587 in May a 31month high Available high frequency indicators suggest that services sector activity has remained on an accelerating trajectory PMI services maintained strong expansion at 612 in May on top of 620 in April 12 Looking ahead higher rabi crop production expected normal monsoon continued buoyancy in services and softening inflation should support household consumption On the other hand given the healthy twin balance sheets of banks and corporates supply chain normalisation and declining uncertainty conditions are favourable for the capex cycle to gain momentum Robust government capital expenditure is also expected to nurture investment and manufacturing activity Consumer and business outlook surveys display continued optimism The headwinds from weak external demand volatility in global financial markets protracted geopolitical tensions and intensity of El Nino impact however pose risks to the outlook Taking all these factors into consideration real GDP growth for 202324 is projected at 65 per cent with Q1202324 at 80 per cent Q2 at 65 per cent Q3 at 60 per cent and Q4 at 57 per cent with risks evenly balanced Inflation 13 Headline CPI inflation has come down during MarchApril 2023 to 47 per cent in April the lowest reading since November 2021 Monetary policy tightening and supply side measures contributed to this process The easing of inflation was observed across food fuel and core CPI excluding food and fuel categories Food inflation declined to 42 per cent in April while core inflation moderated to 51 per cent A durable disinflation in the core component would be critical for a sustained alignment of the headline inflation with the target 14 Going forward with the recent rabi harvest remaining largely immune to the adverse weather events the nearterm inflation outlook looks more favourable than at the time of the April MPC meeting The forecast of a normal southwest monsoon by the India Meteorological Department IMD augurs well for the kharif crops Uncertainties however remain on the spatial and temporal distribution of monsoon and on the interplay between El Nino and the Indian Ocean Dipole IOD Geopolitical tensions uncertainties around the monsoon and international commodity prices especially sugar rice and crude oil and volatility in global financial markets pose upside risks to inflation Taking into account these factors and assuming a normal monsoon CPI inflation is projected at 51 per cent for 202324 with Q1 at 46 per cent Q2 at 52 per cent Q3 at 54 per cent and Q4 at 52 per cent The risks are evenly balanced 15 As noted in the April statement the decision to pause was based on the need to assess the cumulative impact of past monetary policy actions while charting out the future course Subsequent incoming data suggest that while risks to nearterm inflation have moderated somewhat pressure remains during the second half of the year which needs to be watched and addressed at the appropriate time According to our survey inflation expectations of households for three months to one year ahead horizon have moderated by 60 to 70 basis points since September 2022 This would indicate that anchoring of expectations is underway and that our monetary policy actions are yielding the desired results This also provides us the space to keep the policy rate unchanged in this meeting of the MPC At the same time given the uncertainties we need to maintain Arjunas eye1 on the evolving inflation scenario Let me reemphasise that headline inflation still remains above the target and being within the tolerance band is not enough Our goal is to achieve the target of 40 per cent going forward As Mahatma Gandhi had said The ideal must not be lowered2 The continuation of the stance of withdrawal of accommodation should be seen from this perspective Liquidity and Financial Market Conditions 16 Surplus liquidity as reflected in average daily absorptions under the LAF3 at 17 lakh crore during AprilMay was lower than 29 lakh crore during the full year 202223 The shrinkage in surplus liquidity during AprilMay was among other things due to the maturing of TLTROs4 The seasonal expansion in currency in circulation and buildup of government cash balances during this period also moderated surplus liquidity Since the third week of May however the decline in currency in circulation and pickup in government spending have expanded the system liquidity This has got further augmented due to the Reserve Banks market operations and the deposit of 2000 banknotes in banks 17 The prevalence of surplus liquidity amidst higher recourse to the marginal standing facility MSF by some banks suggests skewed liquidity distribution within the banking system5 To address this situation the Reserve Bank conducted a 14day variable rate repo VRR auction amounting to 50000 crore as part of its main operation on May 19 2023 similar to two such auctions conducted earlier in February and March 2023 Reflecting swiftness in its liquidity action the Reserve Bank conducted a 14day variable rate reverse repo VRRR auction of 20 lakh crore on June 2 4day VRRR of 10 lakh crore on June 5 3day VRRR of 75000 crore on June 6 and 2day VRRR of 75000 crore on June 7 considering the overall buildup of surplus liquidity The response has been cautious in these auctions Going forward the Reserve Bank will remain nimble in its liquidity management while ensuring that adequate resources are available for the productive requirements of the economy The Reserve Bank will also ensure the orderly completion of the governments market borrowing programme 18 The moderation in system liquidity along with its skewed distribution was reflected in firming up of money market rates even beyond the repo rate on a few occasions before they came down from May 18 to subrepo rate levels Long term rates have however remained broadly stable This has led to sharp compression of term spreads in the recent period The relative stability of longterm yields augurs well for the economy and suggests effective anchoring of marketbased longterm inflation expectations External Sector 19 In recent months the trade deficit has narrowed on the back of sharper decline in imports visvis exports India is making resolute strides to achieve the US1 trillion merchandise export target by 2030 by focusing on diversification of markets and products leveraging free trade agreements strengthening manufacturing capacity and competitiveness by participating in value chains and through schemes such as Production Linked Incentive PLI across sectors Service exports and remittances have provided valuable support to Indias external sector viability During 202223 services exports grew faster 279 per cent than merchandise exports 69 per cent The current account deficit CAD is expected to have moderated further in Q4202223 and should remain eminently manageable in 202324 also 20 On the financing side foreign portfolio investment FPI flows have seen a significant turnaround in 202324 led by equity flows The net FPI inflows stand at US 84 billion during the current financial year up to June 6 2023 as against net outflows in the preceding two years US 141 billion in 202122 and US 59 billion in 202223 Net FDI flows to India were US 280 billion in 202223 compared to US 386 billion in the previous year Preliminary data for April 2023 suggest that FDI flows have improved Net inflows under nonresident deposits increased to US 80 billion during 202223 from US 32 billion in the previous year The Indian rupee has remained stable since January 2023 Overall Indias external sector remains resilient as key indicators such as CAD to GDP external debt to GDP and international investment position IIP to GDP ratios continue to improve Foreign exchange reserves stood at a comfortable level of US 5951 billion as on June 2 2023 Inclusive of net forward assets foreign exchange reserves are well above US 600 billion Additional Measures 21 I shall now announce certain additional measures Borrowing in Call and Notice Money Markets by Scheduled Commercial Banks 22 The extant regulatory guidelines prescribe prudential limits for outstanding borrowing in Call and Notice Money Markets for Scheduled Commercial Banks SCBs With a view to providing greater flexibility for managing their liquidity it has been decided that SCBs excluding Small Finance Banks can set their own limits for borrowing in Call and Notice Money Markets within the prescribed prudential limits for interbank liabilities Widening of the Scope of the Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets 23 Compromise settlement is recognised as a resolution mechanism in respect of nonperforming assets NPA under the Prudential Framework which is currently applicable to SCBs and select NBFCs It is proposed to issue comprehensive guidelines on compromise settlements and technical writeoffs which will now be applicable to all regulated entities including cooperative banks Further it is also proposed to rationalise the extant prudential norms on restructuring of borrower accounts affected by natural calamities Default Loss Guarantee Arrangement in Digital Lending 24 The Reserve Bank had issued the regulatory framework for Digital Lending in AugustSeptember 2022 With a view to further promoting responsible innovation and prudent risk management it has been decided to issue guidelines on Default Loss Guarantee arrangements in Digital Lending This will further facilitate orderly development of the digital lending ecosystem and enhance credit penetration in the economy Priority Sector Lending PSL Targets for Primary Urban Cooperative Banks UCBs 25 The Reserve Bank has undertaken several initiatives in recent years to strengthen the UCB sector as well as to deepen financial inclusion Such initiatives include revision of the priority sector lending targets for UCBs in 2020 While revising the PSL targets a glide path up to March 2024 was provided for a nondisruptive transition to achieve the revised targets While a number of UCBs have met the required milestones as of March 2023 a need has arisen to ease the implementation challenges faced by other UCBs It has therefore been decided to extend the timelines for achieving the targets by two more years up to March 2026 Further UCBs which have met the targets as on March 31 2023 shall be suitably incentivised Rationalisation of Licensing Framework for Authorised Persons APs under Foreign Exchange Management Act FEMA 1999 26 The licensing framework for Authorised Persons APs issued under FEMA was last reviewed in March 2006 Keeping in view the developments including progressive liberalisation under FEMA over the last several years and to effectively meet the emerging requirements of the rapidly growing Indian economy it has been decided to rationalise and simplify the licensing framework for APs This is expected to improve the efficiency in the delivery of foreign exchange facilities to various segments of users including common persons tourists and businesses Expanding the Scope and Reach of eRUPI Vouchers 27 At present purposespecific eRUPI digital vouchers are issued by banks It is now proposed to expand the scope and reach of eRUPI vouchers by i permitting nonbank prepaid payment instruments PPI issuers to issue eRUPI vouchers ii enabling issuance of eRUPI vouchers on behalf of individuals and iii simplifying the process of issuance redemption etc These measures will make the benefits of eRUPI digital voucher accessible to a wider set of users and further deepen the penetration of digital payments in the country Streamlining the Bharat Bill Payment System BBPS Processes and Membership Criteria 28 The Bharat Bill Payment System BBPS is operational since August 2017 The scope of BBPS was further expanded in December 2022 To further enhance the efficiency of the BBPS system and to encourage greater participation it is proposed to streamline the process flow of transactions and membership criteria for operating units Internationalising Issuance and Acceptance of RuPay Cards 29 RuPay Debit and Credit cards issued by banks in India are gaining increased acceptance abroad It has now been decided to permit issuance of RuPay Prepaid Forex cards by banks This will expand the payment options for Indians travelling abroad Further RuPay cards will be enabled for issuance in foreign jurisdictions These measures will expand the reach and acceptance of RuPay cards globally Conclusion 30 We have made good progress in containing inflation supporting growth and maintaining financial and external sector stability Despite three years of global turmoil Indias growth has bounced back and headline CPI inflation is easing This confluence of factors gives us the confidence that our policies are on the right track Nevertheless we need to move towards our primary target of 4 per cent inflation It is always the last leg of the journey which is the toughest I wish to emphasise that we will do whatever is necessary to ensure that longterm inflation expectations remain firmly anchored The best contribution of monetary policy to the economys ability to realise its potential is by ensuring price stability The Reserve Bank will remain watchful and proactive in dealing with emerging risks to price and financial stability Let me end by recalling the inspiring words of Mahatma Gandhi If we are determined we shall find the way that leads us to our goal6 Thank you

https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=55538,Date Minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee Meeting April 3 5 and 6 2023,Under Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 The forty second meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee MPC constituted under Section 45ZB of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 was held during April 3 5 and 6 2023 2 The meeting was attended by all the members Dr Shashanka Bhide Honorary Senior Advisor National Council of Applied Economic Research Delhi Dr Ashima Goyal Emeritus Professor Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research Mumbai Prof Jayanth R Varma Professor Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad Dr Rajiv Ranjan Executive Director the officer of the Reserve Bank nominated by the Central Board under Section 45ZB2c of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 Dr Michael Debabrata Patra Deputy Governor in charge of monetary policy and was chaired by Shri Shaktikanta Das Governor 3 According to Section 45ZL of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 the Reserve Bank shall publish on the fourteenth day after every meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting which shall include the following namely the resolution adopted at the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee the vote of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee ascribed to such member on the resolution adopted in the said meeting and the statement of each member of the Monetary Policy Committee under subsection 11 of section 45ZI on the resolution adopted in the said meeting 4 The MPC reviewed the surveys conducted by the Reserve Bank to gauge consumer confidence households inflation expectations corporate sector performance credit conditions the outlook for the industrial services and infrastructure sectors and the projections of professional forecasters The MPC also reviewed in detail the staffs macroeconomic projections and alternative scenarios around various risks to the outlook Drawing on the above and after extensive discussions on the stance of monetary policy the MPC adopted the resolution that is set out below Resolution 5 On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation the Monetary Policy Committee MPC at its meeting today April 6 2023 decided to The standing deposit facility SDF rate remains unchanged at 625 per cent and the marginal standing facility MSF rate and the Bank Rate at 675 per cent These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the mediumterm target for consumer price index CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of 2 per cent while supporting growth The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below Assessment Global Economy 6 Global economic activity remains resilient amidst the persistence of inflation at elevated levels turmoil in the banking system in some advanced economies AEs tight financial conditions and lingering geopolitical hostilities Recent financial stability concerns have triggered risk aversion flights to safety and heightened financial market volatility Sovereign bond yields fell steeply in March on safe haven demand reversing the sharp increase in February over aggressive monetary stances and communication Equity markets have declined since the last MPC meeting and the US dollar has pared its gains Weakening external demand spillovers from the banking crisis in some AEs volatile capital flows and debt distress in certain vulnerable economies weigh on growth prospects Domestic Economy 7 The second advance estimates SAE released by the National Statistical Office NSO on February 28 2023 placed Indias real gross domestic product GDP growth at 70 per cent in 202223 Private consumption and public investment were the major drivers of growth 8 Economic activity remained resilient in Q4 Rabi foodgrains production is expected to increase by 62 per cent in 202223 The index of industrial production IIP expanded by 52 per cent in January while the output of eight core industries rose even faster by 89 per cent in January and 60 per cent in February indicative of the strength of industrial activity In the services sector domestic air passenger traffic port freight traffic eway bills and toll collections posted healthy growth in Q4 while railway freight traffic registered a modest growth Purchasing managers indices PMIs pointed towards sustained expansion in both manufacturing and services in March 9 Amongst urban demand indicators passenger vehicle sales recorded strong growth in February while consumer durables contracted in January Among rural demand indicators tractor and twowheeler sales were robust in February As regards investment activity growth in steel consumption and cement output accelerated in February Merchandise exports and nonoil nongold imports contracted in February while the strong growth in services exports continued 10 CPI headline inflation rose from 57 per cent in December 2022 to 64 per cent in February 2023 on the back of higher inflation in cereals milk and fruits and slower deflation in vegetables prices Fuel inflation remained elevated though some softening was witnessed in February due to a fall in kerosene PDS prices and favourable base effects Core inflation ie CPI excluding food and fuel remained elevated and was above 6 per cent in JanuaryFebruary The moderation observed in inflation in clothing and footwear and transportation and communication was largely offset by a pickup in inflation in personal care and effects and housing 11 The average daily absorption under the LAF moderated to 14 lakh crore during FebruaryMarch from an average of 16 lakh crore in DecemberJanuary During 202223 money supply M3 expanded by 90 per cent and nonfood bank credit rose by 154 per cent Indias foreign exchange reserves were placed at US 5784 billion as on March 31 2023 Outlook 12 The inflation trajectory for 202324 would be shaped by both domestic and global factors The expectation of a record rabi foodgrains production bodes well for the food prices outlook The impact of recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms however needs to be watched Milk prices could remain firm due to high input costs and seasonal factors Crude oil prices outlook is subject to high uncertainty Global financial market volatility has surged with potential upsides for imported inflation risks Easing cost conditions are leading to some moderation in the pace of output price increases in manufacturing and services as indicated by the Reserve Banks enterprise surveys The lagged passthrough of input costs could however keep core inflation elevated Taking into account these factors and assuming an annual average crude oil price Indian basket of US 85 per barrel and a normal monsoon CPI inflation is projected at 52 per cent for 202324 with Q1 at 51 per cent Q2 at 54 per cent Q3 at 54 per cent and Q4 at 52 per cent and risks evenly balanced Chart 1 13 A good rabi crop should strengthen rural demand while the sustained buoyancy in contactintensive services should support urban demand The governments thrust on capital expenditure above trend capacity utilisation in manufacturing double digit credit growth and the moderation in commodity prices are expected to bolster manufacturing and investment activity According to the RBIs surveys businesses and consumers are optimistic about the future outlook The external demand drag could accentuate given slowing global trade and output Protracted geopolitical tensions tight global financial conditions and global financial market volatility pose risks to the outlook Taking all these factors into consideration real GDP growth for 202324 is projected at 65 per cent with Q1202324 at 78 per cent Q2 at 62 per cent Q3 at 61 per cent and Q4 at 59 per cent with risks evenly balanced Chart 2 14 With CPI headline inflation ruling persistently above the tolerance band the MPC decided to remain resolutely focused on aligning inflation with the target It is essential to rein in the generalisation of price pressures and anchor inflation expectations An environment of low and stable prices is necessary for the resilience in domestic economic activity to be sustained While the policy rate has been increased by a cumulative 250 basis points since May 2022 which is still working through the system there can be no room for letting down the guard on price stability Taking these factors into account the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent in this meeting with readiness to act should the situation so warrant The MPC will continue to keep a strong vigil on the evolving inflation and growth outlook and will not hesitate to take further action as may be required in its future meetings The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth 15 All members of the MPC Dr Shashanka Bhide Dr Ashima Goyal Prof Jayanth R Varma Dr Rajiv Ranjan Dr Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent 16 Dr Shashanka Bhide Dr Ashima Goyal Dr Rajiv Ranjan Dr Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth Prof Jayanth R Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution 17 The minutes of the MPCs meeting will be published on April 20 2023 18 The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during June 68 2023 Voting on the Resolution to keep the policy repo rate at 650 per cent Statement by Dr Shashanka Bhide 19 The Second Advance Estimates SAE of the National Income for FY 202223 released by the National Statistical Office have retained the overall YOY growth of GDP at constant prices at 7 per cent as provided in the First Advance Estimates FAE published on January 6 2023 However the Provisional Estimates have been replaced by the First Revised Estimates FRE for 202122 as the base and the estimated GDP for 202223 is now actually higher by 13 per cent in the SAE than in FAE Private Final Consumption expenditure Gross Fixed Investment expenditure and exports of goods and services growth rates in FY 202223 have exceeded the growth rate of overall GDP Slower growth of Government Final Consumption expenditure and higher imports have offset the higher pace of growth of other demand components 20 While the overall GDP growth reflects the resilience of the economy a large part of this strength is contributed by the sharp increase in the first quarter of the year a reflection of the rebound from the sharp COVID19 impact of Q1 FY 202021 The YOY growth rate of GDP in Q1 202223 is now placed at 132 per cent and the growth in the subsequent two quarters at 63 and 44 per cent At the sectoral level the growth drivers are the contact intensive Trade Hotels Transport Communication and Services related to Broadcasting Electricity Water Supply and Other utilities and Construction which have registered higher YOY growth rates of Gross Value Added compared to the overall GVA growth rate of 66 per cent for FY 202223 Growth rate of the GVA of Manufacturing in FY 202223 is less than 1 per cent The growth performance therefore points to both uneven growth across production sectors and subdued growth in the more recent quarters of FY 202223 21 The weak global economic environment is marked by decelerating demand and uncertainty in the financial markets and energy markets Some of the weakening demand conditions are due to the monetary policy tightening in the major advanced economies and the slower pace of growth in China The financial market uncertainty is both due to the slowing global growth monetary policy actions to bring down high inflation rates and the continued yearlong Ukraine war impacting a range of markets including energy These conditions are expected to prevail at least until the inflation rates moderate significantly Both IMF and the World Bank have projected World Output YOY growth rates of less than 3 per cent in 2023 and marginally above 3 per cent in 2024 The drag on Indias exports particularly goods exports due to these adverse global demand conditions is therefore expected to prevail in FY 202324 22 Several factors are in play in determining the domestic output growth conditions in the shortterm The dynamics of high frequency indicators points to continuation of the present growth momentum For example the PMI for manufacturing and Services in March have continued to reflect an expansionary phase although both are below their recent peaks The GST collections and Railway freight traffic indicator show moderation in YOY growth in Q3 FY 202223 and the recent months of JanuaryFebruary 2023 Nonfood credit growth however continued expansion at double digit rates The sales growth data for the corporate sector indicates price rise is an important driver of revenue growth in Q3 FY 202223 23 The business outlook sentiments show a mixed picture RBIs survey of enterprises conducted during JanuaryMarch 2023 points to a moderation of its Business Expectations index for the manufacturing sector firms in Q1 FY 202324 although the Business Assessment Index for the prevailing conditions moved up in Q4 FY 202223 Both the indices indicate an expansion of economic activities Expectations of the overall business situation indicate rising optimism through Q1 FY 202324 to Q3 202324 in the case of enterprises in the services and infrastructure sectors Improvement in profit margins is expected by markedly smaller proportion of manufacturing enterprises in Q1 FY 202324 compared to Q4 FY 202223 than the enterprises in services and infrastructure Increase in selling prices appears to be necessary to drive improvement in profit margin The survey of Consumer Confidence for March 2023 points to expectations of improved conditions for employment over the expectations held in the previous round of the survey with a marginal decline in sentiments on general economic conditions and household income In all the three indicators of perceptions of the economy oneyear ahead situation is seen to be substantially superior to the present 24 The estimates of GDP growth YOY for FY 202324 provided by a number of agencies in the period from January 2023 onwards have been around 6 per cent The RBIs Survey of Professional Forecasters conducted in March 2023 provides a median forecast of 60 per cent for 202324 Taking into account the growth trends and factors influencing growth along with an assumption of a normal monsoon for 2023 the GDP growth for FY 202324 is projected at 65 per cent with quarterly break up of Q1 at 78 per cent Q2 at 62 per cent Q3 at 61 per cent and Q4 at 59 per cent The key concern on the growth front in the immediate future is the drag caused by the weak external demand conditions The impact of any adverse weather conditions on Indian agriculture provides additional downside risk to the growth trajectory 25 The headline Consumer price index rose by 65 and 64 per cent in January and February 2023 respectively breaching the upper limit of the tolerance band of the policy target of 4 inflation after two months of below 6 per cent inflation rate in November and December 2022 The key drivers of this high level of overall inflation rate in the recent two months were food items particularly cereals milk and products spices and prepared meals snacks and sweets However the inflation rate of the category comprising of items excluding food and fuel and light has also remained at or above 6 per cent in the first two months of the present calendar year Among the components of the core inflation which exclude food and fuel items price rise was well above 6 per cent in the case of Clothing Footwear Household Goods Services Health and Personal care effects Fuel light has also been at close to double digit inflation rate in the first 11 months of FY 202223 A positive feature of the overall inflation trend is a decline in the monthtomonth momentum decelerating in February 2023 This development needs to be watched as the seasonal patterns may begin to reverse this pattern 26 The combined impact of decelerating international commodity prices significant monetary policy rate increases since May 2022 leading to higher bank deposit and lending rates is yet to translate into inflation rates below the upper tolerance band of the target in a sustained manner There are significant downside risks to output growth momentum and gains from price led revenues for the firms may be limited While policy rate increases were effected over a period of May 2022 to February 2023 the cumulative impact of these policy actions is yet to be realised The recent Inflation Expectations Survey of Households by the RBI points to expectations of reduction in inflation rate 3months ahead and oneyear ahead The survey of firms by the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad points to reduction in the oneyear ahead expected business inflation based on a costbased Business Inflation Index in February 2023 compared to January 2023 The survey also finds a marginal increase in the oneyear ahead expectations of CPI inflation in February 2023 as compared to the expectations in December 2022 with expectations of YOY inflation rates in both the rounds below 5 per cent1 27 The forecast for FY 202324 points to a reduction in inflation rate below the upper tolerance band of 6 per cent with Q1 at 51 per cent Q2 and Q3 at 54 per cent Q4 at 52 per cent and an annual average rate of 52 per cent The decline in projected inflation rates is also supported by the base effect of high inflation rate in FY 202223 28 While these projections point to a path towards achieving the inflation target in the medium term there are clearly upside risks associated with these projections The weather uncertainty affecting key agricultural prices globally and in the domestic markets higher fuel and energy prices due to the supply disruptions resulting from geopolitical conflicts and policies may lead to spikes in inflation rate and reversal of these shocks also may not be quick In this context it is important to assess the extent of the impact of monetary policy actions on inflation rate besides the other developments 29 Taking into account the projected patterns of growth and inflation for FY 202324 the risks attached to these projections and a need to watch the cumulative impact of the monetary policy actions so far I believe that a pause in the policy rates is appropriate in this meeting without any commitments on the subsequent actions except that aligning the inflation rate with the target will remain a policy priority 30 Accordingly I vote a to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent and b to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth Statement by Dr Ashima Goyal 31 The global slowdown is turning out to be less severe than expected but there are signs of a slowing in both growth and inflation suggesting central banks CBs tightening is adequate and lagged effects will bring about the required further fall in inflation But as financial stress materialized in some advanced economies AEs as was to be expected with sharp tightening following sustained excess liquidity the major CBs had to continue to tighten to demonstrate absence of financial dominance Fortunately India had financial deleveraging prior to the pandemic much stronger and more broadbased regulation and supervision as well as ongoing focus on corporate governance so its financial sector has actually outperformed under plurishocks2 Continued regulatory vigilance is essential but it is not necessary to demonstrate independence from financial dominance here Instead Indias better policies and buffers make it possible to demonstrate independence from AE CBs and their weaknesses Inflation here is also different It is relatively close to targetexcess demand due to overstimulus or second round effects due to a tight labour market are not driving it 32 Although growth is resilient there are signs of slowdown in some high frequency data Softening nonoil nongold imports point to weakness in domestic demand slowing exports are affecting manufacturing rising loan rates are reducing demand for low income housing 33 A 2012 RBI working paper3 found monetary policy impacts output with a lag of 23 quarters and inflation with a lag of 34 quarters with the impact persisting for 810 quarters The interest rate channel accounted for about half of the total impact of monetary shocks on output growth and about onethird of the total impact on inflation Its effect on output was 23 times greater than that on inflation Exchange rate changes had an insignificant impact on output growth but a nonnegligible impact on inflation Many time series estimations before and since then had a similar pattern of results A recent IGIDR MPhil on monetary transmission using current data also analysed GDP components and found monetary policy had the largest impact on investment through falling equity prices4 34 By October 2022 the repo rate had risen to a material level 59 with liquidity also tightening and spreads rising for many shortterm market instruments And we see some growth softening two quarters later The lagged effects of the rate rise are just beginning and may continue to play out over the next few months Those on inflation will follow 35 But the estimations above do not include the expectations channel of monetary policy transmission To the extent policy rates rise with inflation and clear communication on the inflation target anchors inflation expectations and there is evidence for this5 the interest rate channel does not have to carry the entire burden of adjustment Inflation will fall faster and the growth sacrifice required to reach the inflation target is lower This is more so if supplyside action is also reducing inflation Such policy is part of the BCCR approachbalanced countercyclical policy with good coordination across fiscal and monetary policy and continuing reform which has helped make India a bright spot in a gloomy global macroeconomic scene 36 Inflation is expected to come down over the year There is the base effect but momentum is also slowing in some consumer goods The RBIs enterprise surveys shows firms expect inputs costs and selling prices to moderate The exchange rate is stable or strengthening The weightage issue that raised cereal prices sharply in the past 2 months is expected to have a reverse effect as market prices fall 37 Since the inflation forecast for FY24 is 52 with Q4 at 52 a repo rate at 65 implies the real policy rate is greater than one It has already tightened enough to progressively bring inflation towards the target of 4 with other complementary policies and barring major new shocks A further rise in real interest rates is best avoided at present since high real rates can trigger a nonlinear switch to a low growth path6 38 There is no logic for overshooting policy rates and then cutting in a country such as India where the largest impact of the interest rate is on growth the relation between expected rupee depreciation and interest rates is weak many tools are available to reduce excess volatility of the exchange rate and have been successfully used the current account deficit has reduced and its financing is no longer an issue Moreover the exchange rate is not directly included in the mandate of the MPC 39 In view of these arguments I vote for a pause But because of erratic weather and continuing global uncertainties and until it is clear that inflation is well on the path to reaching the target it is necessary to emphasize that this may not be the end of the rate hikes So I also vote for withdrawal of accommodation as the stance But this stance is now with respect to the repo rate so it is consistent with the injection of durable liquidity if shocks are so large that LAF instruments prove inadequate Major CBs have allowed their balance sheets to expand as required for other reasons while at the same time raising repo rates for monetary policy purposes Statement by Prof Jayanth R Varma 40 Two inflationary risks have come to the fore since the February meeting The first risk emanates from the announcement of an output cut by OPEC during the weekend just before the MPC meeting Crude oil promptly reversed the entire price decline of the preceding weeks and settled slightly above the levels prevailing at the February meeting The output cut by itself is not worrying as it could simply represent an attempt by OPEC to match supply to sluggish demand in a slowing global economy It would become a matter of concern only if it signals a structural change in the geopolitical alignment of the major oil producing countries So far the crude oil market has been relaxed about this development with the futures curve continuing to slope downward Nevertheless the MPC needs to keep a careful watch on this evolving situation If crude were to creep towards the triple digit mark there might be a need for a monetary response 41 The second risk relates to the monsoon It is only around mid April that scientists are able to provide monsoon forecasts with some degree of confidence and the forecast accuracy improves towards the end of May In this meeting therefore the MPC has no choice but to operate under the default assumption of a normal monsoon However in recent weeks there has been increasing concern about some unfavourable oceanographic patterns that could impact the monsoon this year A deficient monsoon would likely create inflationary pressures that would need to be counteracted with monetary policy measures We will however have to wait till May or even early June to have reasonable clarity on this matter 42 On the growth front early warning signs of a possible slowdown are visible to a greater extent than in February In the current situation of high inflation monetary policy does not have the luxury of responding to these growth headwinds In fact it is almost axiomatic that monetary action can cool inflation only by suppressing demand However policy makers must be vigilant against overshooting the terminal policy rate and thereby slowing the economy to a greater extent than what is needed to glide inflation to the target 43 The balance of risks has in my view shifted slightly towards inflation since the February meeting but the best estimate currently is that the 315 basis points of effective tightening of the overnight interest rate from a reverse repo rate of 335 to a repo rate of 650 would be quite sufficient to bring inflation under control Therefore I vote in favour of keeping the policy rate unchanged in this meeting 44 Turning to the stance I must confess that I fail to comprehend its meaning My colleagues in the MPC assure me that the language is crystal clear to market participants and others It may well be that I am the only person who finds it hard to understand But I am unable to reconcile the language of the stance with the simple fact that no further withdrawal of accommodation remains to be done since the repo rate has already been raised to the 650 level prevailing at the beginning of the previous easing cycle in February 2019 It is of course possible to undertake further tightening but that would not constitute a withdrawal of accommodation by any stretch of the imagination 45 One interpretation that has been offered is that the real interest rate measured using the most recent published inflation rate needs to rise further This is doubtless true but monetary policy should not be conducted by looking at the rear view mirror The real interest rate must be measured against the projected inflation rate 34 quarters ahead and as things stand right now there is very little ground to argue for a further rise in the correctly measured real interest rate Moreover even if a flawed definition of the real interest rate is accepted the projected rise in this real rate would not require any action by the MPC it would happen as a mechanical result of a falling inflation rate and an unchanged policy rate And the projected fall in the inflation rate would be a consequence of what the MPC has already done and not what it will do in coming months 46 I cannot put my name to a stance that I do not even understand At the same time it is clear that the war against inflation has not yet been won and it would be premature to declare an end to this tightening cycle There is need for heightened vigilance in the face of the fresh risks that I highlighted earlier in my statement For these reasons I refrain from dissenting on this part of the resolution and confine myself to expressing reservations on it Statement by Dr Rajiv Ranjan 47 Let me begin from where I ended my last minutes of February 2023 Going ahead assessment of the impact of the cumulative rate hikes will become important especially in view of higher policy transmission in a primarily bankbased economy Consistent with that assessment and in the wake of new information that has since become available I vote for a pause in todays meeting 48 First the crosscurrents of uncertainty continue to sweep across the globe The challenges faced in recent times have raised important questions about the conduct of monetary policy under heightened uncertainty The gradient of unpredictability in the economy runs deeper from quantifiable risks in the near term to unknowable Knightian uncertainty Knight 19217 over longer time horizons Faced with these uncertainties the science of monetary policy which is premised on a forwardlooking and a rulebased approach Clarida Gali and Gertler 19998 must be blended with the art of monetary policy which is datacentric and based on prudent judgement of policymakers A virtuous guide to policymaking in such times is to tread cautiously Orphanides 20039 As the then President of the ECB Mario Draghi put it in a dark room you move with tiny steps10 I believe we are currently poised appropriately at this juncture to pause in the backdrop frontloaded rate actions even as monetary policy remains finely calibrated to the domestic and global situation 49 Second there are some clear positive signals visible on the domestic front Inflationary expectations are gradually easing domestic growth momentum remains robust and India so far is insulated from the global banking crisis 50 Third it is important to keep in mind that there was considerable noise in the high inflation readings of JanuaryFebruary 2023 attributed to the statistical effect with respect to treatment of cereals11 51 Fourth though inflation at present remains above the comfort zone there are reasons for optimism going forward The heat wave of February and the unseasonal rains of March are expected to have only some localised impacts raising the prospects of an overall good rabi harvest High frequency food price indicators for the month of March are already indicating a decline in wheat prices Furthermore international food prices have registered a decline of around 19 per cent in February 2023 from its peak in March 2022 which could help lower costs for critical import dependent food items through appropriate trade policies Global metals and industrial input prices have also seen significant correction from their March 2022 peak levels which could likely result in softening of core inflation pressures over the year though in a protracted manner The key factors that could adversely affect the inflation trajectory over 202324 are climate related structural demandsupply imbalance in important food items such as milk and volatile crude oil prices At present there is considerable uncertainty on how these events will play out over the year hence a wait and watch approach may be a better strategy 52 Fifth though core CPI inflation excluding food and fuel continued to remain sticky and elevated there are signs of a modest softening in February which was also observed across various other exclusion as well as trimmed mean measures of underlying inflation The monthovermonth MoM seasonally adjusted annualised rate SAAR of core CPI has also slowed down from around 6 per cent in December 2022 to around 5 per cent in February 2023 Moreover headline CPI diffusion indices for February though indicating an expansion of prices also showed that for the first time since July 2022 a significant majority the CPI basket registered price increases of less than 6 per cent SAAR Diffusion indices for a core CPI which also excludes petrol diesel gold and silver have also indicated price expansion at rates lower than 6 per cent SAAR since November 2022 Softer household inflation expectations revealed by RBIs latest survey provides comfort that second order effects on inflation will also remain subdued 53 Sixth new incoming information suggests that the growth outlook for 202324 has improved with investment revival likely to become more entrenched along with a lesser drag from external demand The governments sustained focus on infrastructure spending will also crowd in private investment and support growth12 54 Seventh during the last one year of monetary policy normalisation the operating target of monetary policy is up by around 320 basis points the effects of which are yet to be fully transmitted to domestic macroeconomic aggregates In the backdrop of increasing depth and liquidity in financial markets the long and variables lags of monetary policy may have shortened in recent years supported by complementary tools of better communication forward guidance and balance sheet policies The shift to external benchmark lending rate EBLR is an additional factor that has hastened the speed of transmission Under these conditions monetary policy tightening needs to be calibrated judiciously 55 Eighth real policy rates whether ex ante or ex post whether based on headline or core inflation are now positive and expected to increase further given our projected inflation path13 56 Notwithstanding this let me state that this is a wait and watch pause It is neither a premature pause nor a permanent one Not premature because we have already increased policy rate by 250 bps in about a year with frontloaded rate action of about 190 bps during the first 5 months Not permanent as any durable decline in inflation towards the target of 4 per cent is still distant14 Therefore I vote to continue with our stance of withdrawal of accommodation The inherent strength and resilience of the Indian economy with inflation expected to moderate going forward inspires confidence of our actions Statement by Dr Michael Debabrata Patra 57 The momentum of economic activity in India is broadening and slack is being pulled in The underlying price buildup indicates that demand pressures remain strong especially for contactintensive services Hence inflation remains elevated and generalised and as I stated at the time of the MPCs February 2023 meeting it is the biggest risk to the outlook for the Indian economy 58 The lessons of experience and empirical evidence show incontrovertibly that inflation ruling above 6 per cent as it has done through 202223 is inimically harmful for growth This is already showing up in the deceleration of private consumption spending and the moderation in sales growth in the corporate sector which in turn is hamstringing new investment In my view the baseline projection for real GDP growth at 65 per cent for 202324 will benefit from an upside from budgeted capital expenditure this advantage should not however be frittered away by inflation By current reckoning the future path of inflation is vulnerable to several supply shocks The MPC must accordingly remain on high alert and ready to act preemptively if risks intensify to both sides of its commitment price stability and growth 59 Monetary policy must persevere with the withdrawal of accommodation The stance of policy has to remain disinflationary and unwavering in its resolve to align inflation with the target of 4 per cent It is prudent to anticipate future shocks to the inflation trajectory while evaluating the cumulative tightening of monetary policy so far Bank credit growth is already reflecting the passthrough of past monetary policy actions although it remains robust relative to the pace of underlying activity in the economy and financial conditions more generally are supportive of growth 60 While I vote for a pause in this meeting an ongoing assessment of the macroeconomic outlook should inform a preparedness to recalibrate monetary policy towards a more restrictive stance with consistent actions should risks to the inflation trajectory materialise and impede its alignment with the target The process of getting inflation back to target could turn out to be gradual and uneven but the mission of monetary policy is to shepherd this process through potential bumps while containing second round effects and anchoring inflation expectations Statement by Shri Shaktikanta Das 61 Since the last meeting of the MPC in February 2023 the global economic environment has changed dramatically While issues of geopolitics and high inflation continue to impact the outlook the emergence of banking sector turmoil on both sides of the Atlantic and the sudden announcement of oil production cut by the OPEC countries have rendered the global outlook even more uncertain Global inflation is easing but at a tardy pace Central banks face a runway which is becoming narrower and bumpy for softlanding 62 Against this background inflation in India during JanuaryFebruary 2023 exceeded the upper tolerance limit of 6 per cent after a transitory respite during NovemberDecember 2022 Going forward inflation projection for 202324 is indicating a moderation to an average of 52 per cent Both domestic as well as global factors are expected to bring about this disinflation There is better optimism on rabi harvest despite the recent unseasonal rains This could significantly reduce price pressures on rabi food crops particularly wheat Further prices of edible oils have moderated The softening of global commodity prices from their peak levels a year ago is translating into lower input cost pressures for manufactured goods and services These could result in some softening of core inflation going forward The overall situation nonetheless remains dynamic and fast evolving Clarity on monsoon would be available in the coming months Milk prices may remain firm in the lean summer season on tight demandsupply balance and high fodder costs The rising uncertainty in international crude oil prices also warrants close monitoring 63 In parallel domestic growth impulses remained buoyant in Q4202223 Looking ahead the thrust on infrastructure spending by the government would support investment activity The drag from net external demand is moderating Overall broadening of economic activity and the strength of the external sector have allowed us room to remain steadfastly focused on inflation 64 We have consecutively raised the policy repo rate by 250 basis points since May 2022 when we started the current rate hike cycle Together with the introduction of the Standing Deposit Facility SDF at a rate 40 basis points above the fixed rate reverse repo rate the effective rate hike has been 290 basis points In tandem our market operations have reined in surplus liquidity in an orderly manner These actions have collectively transmitted into the weighted average call money rate WACR the operating target of monetary policy along with other shortterm rates 65 The cumulative impact of our monetary policy actions over the last one year is still unfolding and needs to be monitored closely Inflation for 202324 is projected to soften but the disinflation towards the target is likely to be slow and protracted The projected inflation in Q4202324 at 52 per cent would still be well above the target Therefore at this juncture we have to persevere with our focus on bringing about a durable moderation in inflation and at the same time give ourselves some time to monitor the impact of our past actions I am therefore of the view that we do a tactical pause in this meeting of the MPC Accordingly I vote for a pause in rate action and for remaining focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth This is a tactical pause and not a pivot or a change in policy direction We will continue to monitor all incoming information and undertake forwardlooking assessment of the evolving economic outlook and stand ready to act should the situation so warrant Our fight against inflation is far from over and we have to continue with our efforts to bring down inflation closer to the target over the medium term

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=55471,Date Governors Statement,The year 2023 began on a promising note as supply conditions were improving economic activity remained resilient financial markets exuded greater optimism and central banks were steering their economies towards a soft landing In just a few weeks during March this narrative has undergone a dramatic shift The global economy is now witnessing a renewed phase of turbulence with fresh headwinds from the banking sector turmoil in some advanced economies Bank failures and contagion risk have brought financial stability issues to the forefront Given the stubbornness in inflation central banks continue to tighten monetary policy although at a reduced pace Inflation globally has moderated in the recent months but its descent to the target is proving to be long and arduous 2 The former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan had once said Uncertainty is the defining characteristic of the monetary policy landscape1 This he was talking in an era of great moderation and in more normal times compared to todays situation What we are witnessing today is unprecedented uncertainty in geopolitics economic activity price pressures and financial markets never seen before One can imagine the magnitude of challenges central banks and other policy makers face in todays world Decisions and Deliberations of the Monetary Policy Committee MPC 3 The Monetary Policy Committee MPC met on 3rd 5th and 6th April 2023 and assessed the macroeconomic situation and its outlook It decided unanimously to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent in this meeting with readiness to act should the situation so warrant Consequently the standing deposit facility SDF rate will remain unchanged at 625 per cent and the marginal standing facility MSF rate and the Bank Rate at 675 per cent The MPC also decided by a majority of 5 out of 6 members to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth Let me emphasise that the decision to pause on the repo rate is for this meeting only 4 I would now like to explain the MPCs rationale for these decisions on the policy rate and the stance While the recent high frequency indicators suggest some improvement in global economic activity the outlook is now tempered by additional downside risks from financial stability concerns Headline inflation is moderating but remains well above the targets of central banks These developments have led to heightened volatility in global financial markets as reflected in sizeable twoway movements in bond yields fall in equity markets and the US dollar shedding its gains from its peak of September 2022 5 Amidst this volatility the banking and nonbanking financial service sectors in India remain healthy and financial markets have evolved in an orderly manner Economic activity remains resilient and real GDP growth is expected to have been 70 per cent in 202223 Consumer price inflation however has increased since December 2022 driven by price pressures in cereals milk and fruits Core inflation remains elevated 6 Looking ahead headline inflation is projected to moderate in 202324 The monetary policy actions taken since May 2022 are still working through the system Accordingly the MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged to assess the progress made so far while closely monitoring the evolving inflation outlook The MPC will not hesitate to take further action as may be required in its future meetings 7 To recapitulate the actions taken so far we have increased the policy repo rate cumulatively by 250 bps in the last 11 months starting May 2022 This was preceded by the introduction of the Standing Deposit Facility SDF at a rate 40 bps higher than the fixed rate reverse repo Thus the effective rate hike since April last year has been 290 bps These increases have been fully transmitted to the overnight weighted average call money rate WACR the operating target of monetary policy which has gone up from daily average of 332 per cent in March 2022 to 652 per cent in March 2023 It is now necessary to evaluate the cumulative impact of these rate hikes Under these circumstances we have to be extremely prudent in our actions We have always been very watchful and have adopted a calibrated and balanced approach and will continue to do so 8 When we started the rate cut cycle in February 2019 to provide support to growth the CPI inflation was around 2 per cent2 and the policy repo rate was 650 per cent Now the policy rate is 650 per cent but inflation is 64 per cent February 2023 Overall inflation is above the target and given its current level the present policy rate can still be regarded as accommodative Hence the MPC decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation Assessment of Growth and Inflation Growth 9 As stated earlier Indias real gross domestic product GDP is expected to have recorded a growth of 70 per cent in 202223 Hence economic activity remains resilient 10 On the supply side rabi foodgrains production is estimated to increase by 62 per cent in 202223 PMI manufacturing remained robust at 564 in March recording expansion for the 21st consecutive month due to favourable domestic demand Services sector activity exhibited buoyancy PMI services remained in expansion zone at 578 in March driven by favourable demand conditions and new business gains 11 Aggregate demand conditions were resilient in Q4 of 202223 even as private consumption showed some signs of slowdown Urban demand indicators like passenger vehicle sales and credit cards spending registered robust growth in February while consumer durables contracted in January Rural demand indicators such as consumer nondurables tractor and two wheeler sales registered healthy growth Investment activity exhibited buoyancy on the back of governments thrust on infrastructure spending high capacity utilisation and revival in corporate investment in certain key sectors3 Nonfood bank credit rose by 154 per cent yoy as on March 24 2023 The total flow of resources to the commercial sector has increased by 260 lakh crore during 202223 as against 190 lakh crore a year ago Merchandise exports and nonoil nongold imports contracted in February Services exports continued to register robust growth Supply chains are returning to normalcy globally as well as domestically 12 Looking ahead the higher rabi production has brightened the prospects for agriculture sector and rural demand The steady growth in contactintensive services should be positive for urban demand The governments focus on capital expenditure capacity utilisation above longperiod average and moderating commodity prices should bolster manufacturing and investment activity The drag from net external demand may continue due to increased global headwinds The protracted geopolitical tensions and global financial market volatility pose downside risks to the outlook Taking all these factors into consideration real GDP growth for 202324 is projected at 65 per cent with Q1 at 78 per cent Q2 at 62 per cent Q3 at 61 per cent and Q4 at 59 per cent The risks are evenly balanced Inflation 13 The softening in inflation during NovemberDecember 2022 turned out to be transitory with CPI headline inflation breaching the upper tolerance threshold during JanuaryFebruary 20234 A sharp turnaround in food inflation drove the pickup in headline inflation as core inflation remained elevated across a range of goods and services 14 Looking ahead the expectation of a record rabi harvest bodes well for easing of food price pressures There is already evidence of a correction in wheat prices in March on supply side interventions by the Government The impact of the recent unseasonal rains in some parts of the country however needs to be watched Global commodity prices have moderated significantly from their heightened levels a year ago As our surveys point out cost conditions have somewhat eased Inflation expectations of households have also edged down On the upside adverse climatic conditions are a risk to the future inflation trajectory Milk prices are also likely to remain firm going into the summer season due to tight demandsupply balance and fodder cost pressures The rising uncertainty in international financial markets and imported inflation pressures need to be monitored closely Taking into account these factors and assuming an annual average crude oil price Indian basket of US 85 per barrel and a normal monsoon CPI inflation is projected to moderate to 52 per cent for 202324 with Q1 at 51 per cent Q2 at 54 per cent Q3 at 54 per cent and Q4 at 52 per cent The risks are evenly balanced 15 Let me now summarise what I have said so far We are living in very volatile times The sudden announcement of an output cut by OPEC a few days ago and the resultant jump in crude oil prices is yet another evidence of this volatility The overall outlook thus remains dynamic and fast evolving Our monetary policy in the recent period has aimed for a nondisruptive normalisation from the pandemic era stimulus measures Even as monetary policy moved decisively to withdrawal of accommodation financial conditions evolved in line with the productive requirements of the economy Growth has since then become broadbased Inflation has softened from its elevated levels a year ago however it still remains above the upper tolerance band Projections for 202324 point to a softening in inflation though the disinflation is likely to be gradual and protracted given the rigidity in core or underlying inflation pressures At this stage we remain watchful of the evolving outlook and the impact of our actions during the past one year on the broader real economy While we have kept the policy rate unchanged it is important to bear in mind that that this decision was taken on the basis of our assessment of the macroeconomic and financial conditions with reference to the information available up to today Our job is not yet finished and the war against inflation has to continue until we see a durable decline in inflation closer to the target We stand ready to act appropriately and in time We are confident that we are on the right track to bring down inflation to the target rate over the medium term As we proceed towards this objective I recall the wise counsel of Kautilya more than two thousand years ago Be not slack before the whole job is finished5 Financial Stability 16 With the fight against inflation far from over the global economy is now confronted with serious financial stability challenges from the recent banking sector developments in some advanced economies This calls for a reappraisal of the responsibilities of the regulators and the regulated entities world over and their collective role in safeguarding the stability of the financial system While regulators need to identify potential vulnerabilities and take proactive regulatory and supervisory measures it is incumbent upon the regulated institutions to exercise due diligence in their risk management and corporate governance practices They need to pay close attention to assetliability mismatches and profile of their deposit base while building up adequate capital buffers and conducting periodic stress tests 17 It is in this context that we in the Reserve Bank have focused on macroand microprudential measures in recent years to prevent buildup of financial vulnerabilities We have adopted a prudent approach towards regulation and supervision and have taken several steps in these areas in recent years6 Some of these regulatory measures are listed in the footnote of this statement 18 Our supervisory systems have also been strengthened significantly in recent years We have adopted a unified and harmonised supervisory approach for commercial banks NBFCs and urban cooperative banks UCBs7 The focus is now more on identifying the root cause of vulnerabilities rather than dealing with the symptoms alone As a result the Indian banking system remains sound and healthy with strong capital and liquidity positions improving asset quality better provisioning coverage along with improved profitability8 19 Nevertheless we are keeping a close watch on the banking sector turmoil in some developed countries In this context let me once again recall Kautilyas wisdom which remains relevant even for todays world In the interests of the prosperity of the country we should be diligent in foreseeing the possibility of calamities try to avert them before they arise overcome those which happen remove all obstructions to economic activity 9 Liquidity and Financial Market Conditions 20 The Reserve Bank will continue to adopt a nuanced and agile approach to liquidity management Amidst large moderation in surplus liquidity the Reserve Bank conducted 14day variable rate repo VRR auctions main operation on February 10 and March 10 and a finetuning 5day VRR auction on March 24 2023 In the period ahead the Reserve Bank will remain flexible in meeting the productive requirements of the economy through twoway operations as may be necessary We will also ensure the completion of the Government borrowing programme in a nondisruptive manner while maintaining orderly market conditions during 202324 21 The Indian Rupee has moved in an orderly manner in the calendar year 2022 and continues to be so in 2023 also This is reflective of the strength of domestic macroeconomic fundamentals and the resilience of the Indian economy to global spillovers We remain watchful and focused on maintaining stability of the Indian rupee External Sector 22 The current account deficit CAD for the first three quarters of 202223 stood at 27 per cent of GDP In Q3 CAD narrowed significantly to 22 per cent from 37 per cent in Q2 on account of lower merchandise trade deficit and robust growth in services exports Strong software services export growth was witnessed across key verticals such as IT services Business Process Management BPM and engineering research and design ERD supported by a rise in global capability centres GCCs 23 The merchandise trade deficit further narrowed during January and February 2023 from its level in Q3202223 on the back of a sustained decline in imports Moreover Indias services exports continued to grow at a healthy pace in the first two months of 2023 Better growth prospects of the gulf cooperation council GCC countries are expected to keep remittances robust In fact inward gross remittances touched an alltime high of US 1075 billion during calendar year 2022 The CAD is expected to remain moderate in Q4202223 and in the year 202324 at a level that is both viable and eminently manageable 24 Overall our external sector indicators have improved significantly Foreign exchange reserves have rebounded from US 5245 billion on October 21 2022 and now stand in excess of US 600 billion taking into account our forward assets Additional Measures 25 I shall now announce certain additional measures Developing an Onshore Nondeliverable Derivative Market 26 Banks in India with IFSC Banking Units IBUs were earlier permitted to transact in Indian Rupee INR nondeliverable foreign exchange derivative contracts NDDCs with nonresidents and with other eligible banks having IBUs It is now proposed to permit banks with IBUs to offer NDDCs involving INR to resident users in the onshore market This measure will further deepen the forex market in India and provide enhanced flexibility to residents in meeting their hedging requirements Enhancing Efficiency of Regulatory Processes 27 At present the processes for entities to make applications seeking license authorisation or regulatory approvals from the Reserve Bank under various statutes regulations take place in both online and offline modes To simplify and streamline such processes and in line with the Union Budget 202324 announcement it has been decided to have a secured web based centralised portal named as PRAVAAH Platform for Regulatory Application Validation And AutHorisation for such processes The portal will show time limits for deciding on the applicationsapprovals sought This measure will bring greater efficiencies into regulatory processes and facilitate ease of doing business for the regulated entities of the Reserve Bank Development of Centralised Web Portal for the Public to Search Unclaimed Deposits 28 At present the depositors or beneficiaries of unclaimed bank deposits of 10 years or more have to go through the websites of multiple banks to locate such deposits Now in order to improve and widen the access of depositors beneficiaries to information on such unclaimed deposits it has been decided to develop a web portal to enable search across multiple banks for possible unclaimed deposits This will help depositorsbeneficiaries in getting back unclaimed deposits Grievance Redress Mechanism relating to Credit Information Reporting by Credit Institutions and Credit information provided by Credit Information Companies 29 Recently the Credit Information Companies CICs were brought under the purview of the Reserve Bank Integrated Ombudsman Scheme RBIOS It is now proposed to put in place the following measures i a compensation mechanism for delayed updationrectification of credit information reports ii a provision for SMSemail alerts to customers whenever their credit information reports are accessed iii a timeframe for inclusion of data received by CICs from Credit Institutions and iv disclosures on customer complaints received by CICs These measures will further enhance consumer protection Operation of PreSanctioned Credit Lines at Banks through the UPI 30 The Unified Payments Interface UPI has transformed retail payments in India UPIs robustness has been leveraged to develop new products and features from time to time Recently RuPay credit cards were permitted to be linked to UPI This was in addition to the existing facility of linkage of UPI with deposit accounts It is now proposed to expand the scope of UPI by permitting operation of presanctioned credit lines at banks through the UPI This initiative will further encourage innovation Conclusion 31 Since early 2020 the world is going through a period of extreme uncertainty In this daunting environment Indias financial sector remains resilient and stable Overall the broadening of economic activity the expected moderation in inflation the fiscal consolidation with focus on capital spending the significant narrowing of the current account deficit to more sustainable levels and the comfortable level of foreign exchange reserves are welcome developments which will further bolster Indias macroeconomic stability This allows monetary policy to remain unwaveringly focused on inflation With unyielding core inflation we remain firm and resolute in our pursuit of price stability which is the best guarantee for sustainable growth The impact of our actions over the past 12 months is still playing out and would increasingly weigh on the future inflation trajectory As I noted in my policy statement in April last year our goals of price stability sustained growth and financial stability are mutually reinforcing and we continue to be guided by this approach We remain vigilant and ready to face the challenges with a firm commitment to price and financial stability

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=55472,Date Monetary Policy Statement 202324 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee MPC April 3 5 and 6 2023,On the basis of an assessment of the current and evolving macroeconomic situation the Monetary Policy Committee MPC at its meeting today April 6 2023 decided to The standing deposit facility SDF rate remains unchanged at 625 per cent and the marginal standing facility MSF rate and the Bank Rate at 675 per cent These decisions are in consonance with the objective of achieving the mediumterm target for consumer price index CPI inflation of 4 per cent within a band of 2 per cent while supporting growth The main considerations underlying the decision are set out in the statement below Assessment Global Economy 2 Global economic activity remains resilient amidst the persistence of inflation at elevated levels turmoil in the banking system in some advanced economies AEs tight financial conditions and lingering geopolitical hostilities Recent financial stability concerns have triggered risk aversion flights to safety and heightened financial market volatility Sovereign bond yields fell steeply in March on safe haven demand reversing the sharp increase in February over aggressive monetary stances and communication Equity markets have declined since the last MPC meeting and the US dollar has pared its gains Weakening external demand spillovers from the banking crisis in some AEs volatile capital flows and debt distress in certain vulnerable economies weigh on growth prospects Domestic Economy 3 The second advance estimates SAE released by the National Statistical Office NSO on February 28 2023 placed Indias real gross domestic product GDP growth at 70 per cent in 202223 Private consumption and public investment were the major drivers of growth 4 Economic activity remained resilient in Q4 Rabi foodgrains production is expected to increase by 62 per cent in 202223 The index of industrial production IIP expanded by 52 per cent in January while the output of eight core industries rose even faster by 89 per cent in January and 60 per cent in February indicative of the strength of industrial activity In the services sector domestic air passenger traffic port freight traffic eway bills and toll collections posted healthy growth in Q4 while railway freight traffic registered a modest growth Purchasing managers indices PMIs pointed towards sustained expansion in both manufacturing and services in March 5 Amongst urban demand indicators passenger vehicle sales recorded strong growth in February while consumer durables contracted in January Among rural demand indicators tractor and twowheeler sales were robust in February As regards investment activity growth in steel consumption and cement output accelerated in February Merchandise exports and nonoil nongold imports contracted in February while the strong growth in services exports continued 6 CPI headline inflation rose from 57 per cent in December 2022 to 64 per cent in February 2023 on the back of higher inflation in cereals milk and fruits and slower deflation in vegetables prices Fuel inflation remained elevated though some softening was witnessed in February due to a fall in kerosene PDS prices and favourable base effects Core inflation ie CPI excluding food and fuel remained elevated and was above 6 per cent in JanuaryFebruary The moderation observed in inflation in clothing and footwear and transportation and communication was largely offset by a pickup in inflation in personal care and effects and housing 7 The average daily absorption under the LAF moderated to 14 lakh crore during FebruaryMarch from an average of 16 lakh crore in DecemberJanuary During 202223 money supply M3 expanded by 90 per cent and nonfood bank credit rose by 154 per cent Indias foreign exchange reserves were placed at US 5784 billion as on March 31 2023 Outlook 8 The inflation trajectory for 202324 would be shaped by both domestic and global factors The expectation of a record rabi foodgrains production bodes well for the food prices outlook The impact of recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms however needs to be watched Milk prices could remain firm due to high input costs and seasonal factors Crude oil prices outlook is subject to high uncertainty Global financial market volatility has surged with potential upsides for imported inflation risks Easing cost conditions are leading to some moderation in the pace of output price increases in manufacturing and services as indicated by the Reserve Banks enterprise surveys The lagged passthrough of input costs could however keep core inflation elevated Taking into account these factors and assuming an annual average crude oil price Indian basket of US 85 per barrel and a normal monsoon CPI inflation is projected at 52 per cent for 202324 with Q1 at 51 per cent Q2 at 54 per cent Q3 at 54 per cent and Q4 at 52 per cent and risks evenly balanced Chart 1 9 A good rabi crop should strengthen rural demand while the sustained buoyancy in contactintensive services should support urban demand The governments thrust on capital expenditure above trend capacity utilisation in manufacturing double digit credit growth and the moderation in commodity prices are expected to bolster manufacturing and investment activity According to the RBIs surveys businesses and consumers are optimistic about the future outlook The external demand drag could accentuate given slowing global trade and output Protracted geopolitical tensions tight global financial conditions and global financial market volatility pose risks to the outlook Taking all these factors into consideration real GDP growth for 202324 is projected at 65 per cent with Q1202324 at 78 per cent Q2 at 62 per cent Q3 at 61 per cent and Q4 at 59 per cent with risks evenly balanced Chart 2 10 With CPI headline inflation ruling persistently above the tolerance band the MPC decided to remain resolutely focused on aligning inflation with the target It is essential to rein in the generalisation of price pressures and anchor inflation expectations An environment of low and stable prices is necessary for the resilience in domestic economic activity to be sustained While the policy rate has been increased by a cumulative 250 basis points since May 2022 which is still working through the system there can be no room for letting down the guard on price stability Taking these factors into account the MPC decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent in this meeting with readiness to act should the situation so warrant The MPC will continue to keep a strong vigil on the evolving inflation and growth outlook and will not hesitate to take further action as may be required in its future meetings The MPC also decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth 11 All members of the MPC Dr Shashanka Bhide Dr Ashima Goyal Prof Jayanth R Varma Dr Rajiv Ranjan Dr Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das unanimously voted to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 650 per cent 12 Dr Shashanka Bhide Dr Ashima Goyal Dr Rajiv Ranjan Dr Michael Debabrata Patra and Shri Shaktikanta Das voted to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation progressively aligns with the target while supporting growth Prof Jayanth R Varma expressed reservations on this part of the resolution 13 The minutes of the

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=55473,Date Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies,This Statement sets out various developmental and regulatory policy measures relating to i Financial Markets ii Regulation and Supervision and iii Payment and Settlement Systems I Financial Markets 1 Developing an Onshore Nondeliverable Derivatives Market Banks in India which operate International Financial Services Centre IFSC Banking Units IBUs were permitted to transact in INR Nondeliverable foreign exchange derivative contracts NDDCs with nonresidents and with each other with effect from June 1 2020 With a view to develop the onshore INR NDDC and to provide residents with the flexibility to efficiently design their hedging programmes it has been decided to permit banks with IBUs to offer INR NDDCs to resident users in the onshore market These banks will have the flexibility of settling their NDDC transactions with nonresidents and with each other in foreign currency or in INR while transactions with residents will be mandatorily settled in INR Related directions are being issued separately II Regulation and Supervision 2 Enhancing Efficiency of Regulatory Processes Various entities are required to obtain license authorization to carry out activities regulated by RBI Further regulated entities are required to seek certain regulatory approvals from RBI under various statutes regulations periodically Currently the application and approval processes for the same take place in varied online and offline modes The Union Budget for 202324 has announced the need to simplify ease and reduce cost of compliance by financial sector regulators within laid down time limits to decide the applications under various regulations It has therefore been decided to develop a secured web based centralised portal named as PRAVAAH Platform for Regulatory Application Validation And AutHorisation which will gradually extend to all types of applications made to RBI across all functions 3 Development of Centralised Web portal for Public to Search Unclaimed Deposits The deposits remaining unclaimed for 10 years in a bank are transferred to the Depositor Education and Awareness DEA Fund maintained by the Reserve Bank of India Depositors protection being an overarching objective RBI has been taking various measures to ensure that newer deposits do not turn unclaimed and existing unclaimed deposits are returned to the rightful owners or beneficiaries after following due procedure On the second aspect banks display the list of unclaimed deposits on their website In order to improve and widen the access of depositors beneficiaries to such data RBI has decided to develop a web portal to enable search across multiple banks for possible unclaimed deposits based on user inputs The search results will be enhanced by use of certain AI tools 4 Grievance Redress Mechanism relating to Credit Information Reporting by Credit Institutions and Credit information provided by Credit Information Companies With the increase in customer complaints regarding credit information reporting and the functioning of credit information companies CICs it has been decided to put in place a comprehensive framework for strengthening and improving the efficacy of the grievance redress mechanism and customer service provided by the credit institutions CIs and CICs For this purpose the CICs have been brought under the aegis of the Reserve Bank Integrated Ombudsman Scheme RBIOS In addition it is also proposed to put in place the following measures a compensation mechanism for delayed updationrectification of credit information a provision for SMS email alerts to customers when their credit information are accessed from CICs a timeframe for ingestion of data received by CICs from Credit Institutions and disclosures relating to number and nature of customer complaints received on the website of CICs Detailed guidelines in this regard would be issued shortly III Payment and Settlement Systems 5 Operation of PreSanctioned Credit Lines at Banks through the UPI Unified Payments Interface UPI is a robust payments platform supporting an array of features Presently it handles 75 of the retail digital payments volume in India The UPI system has been leveraged to develop products and features aligned to Indias payments digitisation goals Recently RuPay credit cards were permitted to be linked to UPI At present UPI transactions are enabled between deposit accounts at banks sometimes intermediated by prepaid instruments including wallets It is now proposed to expand the scope of UPI by enabling transfer to from presanctioned credit lines at banks in addition to deposit accounts In other words UPI network will facilitate payments financed by credit from banks This can reduce the cost of such offerings and help in development of unique products for Indian markets Detailed instructions in this regard will be issued separately Yogesh Dayal Chief General Manager Press Release 2023202423
https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=21753,Date Monetary Policy Report April 2023,I Macroeconomic Outlook Domestic economic activity remains resilient in a slowing global economy Inflation has persisted at elevated levels across the world and in India Monetary policy remains focussed on progressively aligning inflation with the target Geopolitical hostilities volatile global financial markets and climate shocks are the key risks to the growth and the inflation outlook I1 Key Developments since the September 2022 MPR Since the release of the September 2022 Monetary Policy Report MPR the persistence of inflation at elevated levels across economies continuing geopolitical uncertainties and tightening financial conditions are taking their toll on global economic activity Most central banks remain in tightening mode Financial markets have turned volatile and highly sensitive to incoming information Sovereign bond yields softened during NovemberDecember on hopes of a monetary policy pivot towards smaller rate hikes but hardened during February on stronger than anticipated economic activity and unrelenting price pressures US shortterm bond yields reached their highest levels in a decade and a half in early March Equity markets recovered some lost ground Crude oil and natural gas prices eased to their prewar levels but metal prices remain firm Globally supply conditions have improved in recent months The banking turmoil in the US and Europe and the accompanying financial stability concerns rattled global financial markets in March Increased risk aversion triggered flight to safety and the expectations of an early reversal of the monetary tightening cycle led to a sharp decline in sovereign bond yields across maturities correction in equity prices and jump in market volatility indicators The US dollar has retreated unevenly from its September 2022 highs Domestic economic activity exhibited resilience in H2202223 The National Statistical Offices NSOs second advance estimates placed real gross domestic product GDP growth at 70 per cent for 202223 driven by private consumption and investment Real GDP growth in Q3 was 44 per cent yearonyear yoy boosted by investment demand while private consumption slowed On the supply side activity was supported by agriculture and services sectors while manufacturing was restrained under the pressure of high input costs Consumer price index CPI inflation persisted at elevated levels during 202223 impacted by a series of adverse supply shocks and the continuing passthrough of high input costs Briefly edging into the tolerance band during NovemberDecember with the stronger than usual seasonal correction in food prices it surged again to 64 per cent yoy in February as food inflation rose The Monetary Policy Committee MPC increased the policy repo rate by 250 basis points bps during May 2022February 2023 and monetary policy remains focussed on progressively aligning inflation with the target while supporting growth Monetary Policy Committee September 2022March 2023 When the MPC met in September 2022 CPI headline inflation was at 70 per cent in August Domestic economic activity was gaining traction ahead of the festival season with double digit GDP growth in Q1202223 CPI headline inflation was projected to remain above the upper tolerance level of 6 per cent through the first three quarters of 2022231 The MPC felt that further calibrated monetary policy action was necessary to keep inflation expectations anchored restrain the broadening of price pressures and preempt second round effects Accordingly the MPC raised the policy repo rate by 50 bps to 59 per cent with a 51 vote One member voted for a smaller increase of 35 bps The MPC also decided by a majority of 51 to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward while supporting growth At the time of its December 2022 meeting2 the MPC noted that the CPI inflation print in October was persisting above the tolerance band Real GDP registered a growth of 63 per cent yoy in Q2202223 The MPC observed that while headline inflation was likely to moderate in H1202324 it would still be well above the target Economic activity had held up well and was expected to remain resilient The impact of monetary policy measures undertaken needed to be monitored carefully Against this backdrop the MPC increased the policy repo rate by 35 bps to 625 per cent with a 51 vote and continued with its stance of withdrawal of accommodation on a 4 to 2 majority vote In the run up to the February 2023 meeting CPI headline inflation had eased to 57 per cent in December 2022 driven by strong deflation in vegetable prices even as inflationary pressures became accentuated across other food items and in the core category Domestic economic activity was expected to be sustained by the focus on capital and infrastructure spending in the Union Budget 202324 Looking beyond the transitory respite in inflation due to the fall in vegetable prices the MPC regarded inflation as a major risk to the outlook and observed that further calibrated monetary policy action was warranted to keep inflation expectations anchored break core inflation persistence and thereby strengthen mediumterm growth prospects Accordingly the MPC increased the policy repo rate by 25 bps to 650 per cent and committed to continue withdrawal of accommodation with a 42 vote for both the rate action and the stance decision The MPCs voting pattern reflects the diversity in individual members assessments expectations and policy preferences a characteristic also reflected in voting patterns of other central banks Table I1 Macroeconomic Outlook Chapters II and III analyse macroeconomic developments related to inflation and economic activity during H2202223 October 2022March 2023 The evolution of key macroeconomic and financial variables over the past six months warrants revisions in the baseline assumptions Table I2 First international crude prices eased in H2 on slowing global growth and a milder than expected winter in Europe Geopolitical tensions and output curtailment by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus OPEC plus impart significant uncertainty to the outlook Chart I1a Chart I1b Global petrol and diesel prices which are the key determinant of domestic product prices are elevated in view of demandsupply refinery mismatches Chart I1c Taking into account these developments crude prices Indian basket are assumed at US 85 per barrel in the baseline as compared with US 105 in the September MPR baseline Second the nominal exchange rate of the Indian rupee or INR moved in a range of INR 8183 per US dollar USD in H2 The INR was supported by a correction in the US dollar while riskoff sentiments towards emerging market economies EME assets and a widening current account deficit exerted downward pressures on the currency Taking these developments into consideration the exchange rate is assumed at INR 82 per US dollar in the baseline as against INR 80 in the September 2022 MPR Third while global economic prospects have improved modestly compared to a few months ago the outlook is highly uncertain The global composite purchasing managers index PMI moved into expansion mode in February after remaining in the contraction territory for six consecutive months during July 2022 January 2023 According to the International Monetary Funds IMFs January 2023 update of the World Economic Outlook WEO global growth is expected to moderate from 34 per cent in 2022 to 29 per cent in 2023 and 31 per cent in 2024 with a sharper deceleration projected for advanced economies AEs relative to emerging market and developing economies EMDEs Chart I2 Alongside global trade is expected to decelerate in 2023 I2 The Outlook for Inflation Adverse supply shocks and the passthrough of inputs costs to output prices imparted sustained upward pressures on CPI inflation in H2 Chapter II Looking ahead the three months ahead and the one year ahead median inflation expectations of urban households fell by 30 bps each in the March 2023 round of the Reserve Banks survey3 The proportion of respondents expecting the general price level to increase by more than the current rate decreased for both the horizons visvis the previous round Chart I3 Manufacturing firms polled in the JanuaryMarch 2023 round of the Reserve Banks industrial outlook survey expected the pace of increase in cost of raw materials to remain steady and in selling prices to moderate in Q1202324 Chart I4a4 Services sector and infrastructure firms expected modest softening in the growth of input cost and selling prices in Q1202324 Charts I4b and I4c5 In the PMI surveys manufacturing and services firms reported lower input cost inflation but higher output price inflation in March compared to February 2023 Professional forecasters surveyed by the Reserve Bank in March 2023 expected CPI inflation to moderate from 62 per cent in Q4202223 to 50 per cent in Q1202324 53 per cent in Q2 55 per cent in Q3 and 52 per cent in Q4 Chart I5a and Table I36 The respondents expected CPI inflation excluding food and beverages pan tobacco and intoxicants and fuel and light to move from 62 per cent in Q4202223 to 5456 per cent during 202324 Their 5 and 10years ahead inflation expectations remained unchanged at 50 per cent and 45 per cent respectively in the March round Chart I5b Looking ahead the inflation outlook will be conditioned by several factors both global and domestic While crude oil and commodity prices have corrected in recent months their future trajectories remain uncertain given the lingering geopolitical hostilities and likely demand rebound from countries reopening from pandemicrelated lockdowns Global financial markets are exhibiting volatility Domestically the expectations of a bumper rabi harvest augur well for the future trajectory of food inflation On the other hand adverse weather shocks are becoming more frequent and there is heightened uncertainty about the southwest monsoon rains Taking into account the initial conditions signals from forwardlooking surveys and estimates from structural and other timeseries models7 CPI inflation is projected to average 52 per cent in 202324 51 per cent in Q1202324 54 per cent in Q2 and Q3 and 52 per cent in Q4 with risks evenly balanced Chart I6 The 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals for headline inflation in Q4202324 are 3866 per cent and 3173 per cent respectively For 202425 assuming a normal monsoon a progressive normalisation of supply chains and no further exogenous or policy shocks structural model estimates indicate that inflation will average 45 per cent In Q4202425 CPI inflation is projected at 44 per cent with the 50 per cent and the 70 per cent confidence intervals at 3058 per cent and 2265 per cent respectively The baseline forecasts are subject to several upside and downside risks given the volatile global environment and the crosscountry experience with large deviations of inflation from forecasts Box I1 Upside risks emanate from possible escalation of geopolitical conflicts higher global crude and commodity prices accentuation of global financial market volatility amidst high inflation and financial stability concerns renewed supply chain disruptions extreme weather conditions and deficient monsoon and a larger passthrough of input cost pressures to output prices as demand strengthens Downside risks could stem from an early resolution of geopolitical tensions correction in global crude and commodity prices due to slowing global demand and further improvement in supply conditions Box I1 Inflation Forecast Accuracy Under High Volatility CrossCountry Evidence Since the pandemic overlapping supply and demand shocks have led to inflation surging to its highest levels since the 1970s and 1980s with increased volatility Chart I11 This has led to large inflation forecast errors by both central banks and market forecasters Chahad et al 2022 Reserve Bank of Australia 2022 The Phillips curve framework the workhorse model for inflation forecasting appears to have broken down in the face of large shocks and nonlinearities An analysis of inflation forecasts among a sample of eight central banks8 shows a deterioration in forecasting performance during the pandemic period The forecast errors were higher for longer horizons and for the advanced economies Forecast errors in India were the lowest in this crosscountry comparison Chart I12 Prior to the pandemic forecast errors were statistically not different from zero as suggested by the statistically insignificant constant term and hence they can be regarded as unbiased More recent forecasts have been biased with actual outcomes systematically overshooting forecasts significantly and more so as the horizon increases9 Table I11 A dynamic panel data model estimated for a sample of seven countries covering the period Q12017Q42022 by the Generalized Method of Moments GMM Arellano and Bond 1991 shows high persistence in forecast errors Table I12 The substantial increases in international energy and food prices combined with currency depreciations seem to be the key drivers of the forecast errors Overall the global experience suggests that forecast errors can turn sizeable in the face of large supply shocks and complicate the conduct of forwardlooking monetary policy In such a dynamic and uncertain environment there is a need to supplement baseline forecasts with alternate scenarios and modelling approaches for more precision References Arellano M and S Bond 1991 Some Tests of Specification for Panel Data

in the Inflation Projections of Eurosystem and ECB staff ECB Economic Bulletin Issue 32022 Reserve Bank of Australia 2022 What Explains Recent Inflation Forecast Errors Statement on Monetary Policy November 2022 I3 The Outlook for Growth Domestic economic activity remains resilient on the back of consecutive years of strong agricultural production a postpandemic rebound in contactintensive services buoyant growth in bank credit a healthy banking and financial system10 and the governments capex push Slowing global growth geopolitical tensions upsurge in financial market volatility and tightening global financial conditions however weigh heavily on the outlook Turning to the key messages from forwardlooking surveys consumer confidence the current situation index improved in the March 2023 survey round visvis the previous round on account of improved perceptions on general economic situation employment and household income though it remains in the pessimistic zone Consumers expectations for the year ahead continued in the optimistic territory albeit with some moderation Chart I711 The optimism of firms in the manufacturing sector ebbed for the quarter ahead relative to the previous round in the Reserve Banks industrial outlook survey Chart I8a The expectations of services and infrastructure sector companies on the other hand improved in terms of the overall business situation Charts I8b and I8c Recent surveys by other agencies indicate a mixed picture on business expectations relative to the previous round Table I4 Manufacturing and services firms in the PMI surveys for March 2023 exhibited optimism for the year ahead Professional forecasters polled in the March 2023 round of the Reserve Banks survey expected real GDP growth at 46 per cent in Q4202223 6760 per cent in H1202324 and 5855 per cent in H2 Chart I9 and Table I3 Taking into account the baseline assumptions survey indicators and model forecasts real GDP growth is expected at 65 per cent in 202324 78 per cent in Q1 62 per cent in Q2 61 per cent in Q3 and 59 per cent in Q4 with risks evenly balanced around this baseline path Chart I10 and Table I3 For 202425 assuming a normal monsoon and no major exogenous or policy shocks the structural model estimates indicate real GDP growth at 65 per cent with quarterly growth rates in the range of 5570 per cent There are upside and downside risks to this baseline growth path The upside risks emanate from a strongerthanexpected rebound in the contactintensive services as they emerge more fully from the pandemic a restart of private investment activity boosted by the governments capex push given healthier corporate balance sheets a favourable terms of trade shock in the case of a sharperthananticipated correction in crude and commodity prices a betterthanexpected global growth prospects and an early resolution of geopolitical conflicts On the contrary an escalation in geopolitical tensions a further hardening of international crude oil and other commodity prices sustained disruptions to supply chains persistence of global financial market volatility a sharper loss of momentum in global trade and demand and weatherrelated disruptions pose downside risks to the baseline growth path I4 Balance of Risks The baseline projections of growth and inflation in this chapter are inter alia conditional on assumptions of the future trajectory of key domestic and international macroeconomic variables set out in Table I2 The uncertainties surrounding these assumptions have increased significantly due to protracted geopolitical tensions upside inflation surprises globally international financial market volatility and recurrent adverse weather events Against this backdrop this section explores plausible alternative scenarios to assess the balance of risks around the baseline projections i Global Growth Uncertainties Global growth is slowing with significant downside risks to the baseline outlook Globally inflation remains the key concern and more monetary tightening may be warranted to quell it This could however push global interest rates higher for longer than currently anticipated Debt servicing costs could escalate and add to financial stability risks Moreover geopolitical tensions could ratchet up further In such a scenario if global growth is 100 bps lower than the baseline domestic growth and inflation could be around 30 bps and 15 bps respectively below the baseline trajectories Conversely if inflation in major economies retreats quickly and global financial conditions ease geopolitical tensions ebb and global growth surprises on the upside by turning out to be higher by 50 bps domestic growth and inflation could edge higher by around 15 bps and 7 bps respectively Charts I11a and I12a ii International Crude Oil Prices International crude oil prices have eased since the last MPR but remain volatile A stronger rebound in global demand production cuts by OPEC plus countries and the escalation of geopolitical hostilities could push crude oil prices higher Crack spreads could widen further given global demandsupply mismatches Assuming international crude oil prices to be 10 per cent above the baseline domestic inflation and growth could be higher by 30 bps and weaker by around 15 bps respectively Conversely an early deescalation of geopolitical tensions and subdued global demand owing to aggressive monetary policy action may lead to a moderation in global crude oil prices below the baseline If as a result the Indian basket of crude prices falls by 10 per cent and assuming full passthrough to domestic product prices inflation could ease by around 30 bps with a boost of 15 bps to growth Charts I11a and I12a iii Exchange Rate The INR depreciated relative to the US in H2202223 amidst tightening global financial conditions an uncertain global environment and portfolio outflows The higher for longer interest rate scenario and slowing global growth could keep risk aversion elevated and impinge upon capital flows to EMEs Should the INR depreciate by 5 per cent below the baseline in such a scenario inflation could edge up by around 35 bps while GDP growth could be higher by around 25 bps through the stimulus to exports On the other hand as Indias growth performance and outlook is relatively better than peers it could become attractive for foreign investors Furthermore with the current account deficit narrowing the INR could appreciate relative to the baseline With five per cent appreciation inflation and GDP growth could moderate by around 35 bps and 25 bps respectively Charts I11b and I12b iv Food Inflation Heat waves large unseasonal rains and deviations of the monsoon from its normal pattern are occurring with greater frequency and intensity Such adverse weather events could lead to upward pressures on food prices which could raise headline inflation by around 50 bps Charts I11b and I12b On the other hand the prospects of a bumper rabi harvest adequate buffer stocks effective supply management measures by the government and an improving global food situation could exert downward pressures on food inflation and push headline inflation 50 bps below the baseline The baseline headline inflation path and the balance of risk are strongly conditional on the evolving weather situation and the temporal and spatial spread of the southwest monsoon rainfall I5 Conclusion The Indian economy is expected to be amongst the fastest growing major economies in 202324 backed by strong domestic drivers and strengthening macroeconomic fundamentals The Indian financial sector remains stable Headline inflation is expected to moderate from its prevailing elevated levels and move below the upper tolerance band during 202324 Monetary policy remains focused on progressively aligning inflation with the target Geopolitical hostilities stubborn global inflation volatile global financial markets and climate shocks are the key risks to the growth and the inflation outlook 1 The GDP growth forecast was revised downward by 20 bps to 70 per cent relative to the August 2022 projections while the inflation forecast was retained at 67 per cent for 202223 The GDP growth forecast was revised to 68 per cent in the December 2022 meeting and the inflation forecast to 65 per cent in the February 2023 meeting of the MPC 2 A separate meeting of the MPC was held on November 3 2022 to discuss and draft the report to be sent to the Government by the Reserve Bank of India RBI under the provisions of Section 45ZN of the RBI Act 1934 and Regulation 7 of the RBI MPC and Monetary Policy Process Regulations 2016 consequent to inflation exceeding 6 per cent the upper tolerance threshold around the target for three successive

Reserve Banks consumer confidence survey is being conducted in 19 cities since March 2021 13 cities in the previous rounds and the results of the March 2023 round are based on responses from 6075 respondents II Prices and Costs The path of inflation in H2202223 was buffeted by overlapping domestic food supply shocks which kept inflation above the upper tolerance band barring a transient softening in NovemberDecember 2022 Core inflation persisted at elevated levels in spite of input costs moderating with the softening in international commodity prices Since the September 2022 MPR the headline CPI inflation1 path has been impacted by domestic food supply shocks amidst weather vagaries and the passthrough of pentup input costs A transitory but more than anticipated seasonal correction in vegetable prices during NovemberDecember 2022 brought some relief but this reversed in JanuaryFebruary 2023 due to sustained price pressures from cereals and spices and a pickup in proteinbased food inflation With improving domestic demand conditions input costs were steadily passed on to retail prices of goods and services imparting considerable stickiness to the already elevated core CPI excluding food and fuel inflation2 Reflecting these multiple shocks headline inflation averaged 71 per cent yearonyear yoy during SeptemberOctober before a shortlived dip to 57 per cent by December A resurgence of food price pressures pushed headline inflation to 65 per cent during JanuaryFebruary 2023 Core inflation hovered at or above 6 per cent throughout H2 Chart II1 The Reserve Bank of India RBI Act enjoins the RBI to set out deviations of actual inflation outcomes from projections if any and to explain the underlying reasons thereof The September 2022 MPR had projected inflation at 65 per cent for Q3202223 and 58 per cent for Q4 Actual inflation trailed the projection by 40 bps in Q3 mainly due to the sharper than expected seasonal correction in vegetables prices that also commenced earlier than usual the monthonmonth mom decline in prices of CPI vegetables at 83 per cent in November 2022 was the highest in the current CPI 2012100 series for the month of November Chart II2 This was followed by an even larger decline in vegetable prices in December In fact the cumulative price decline of around 20 per cent in NovemberDecember turned out to be the highest in the current CPI series In Q4 JanuaryFebruary 2023 the situation reversed with higher than anticipated cereal price inflation catapulting inflation by around 70 bps above projections Forecast errors in Q4 were also attributable to the CPI aggregation methodology due to the redistribution of weights away from the freely distributed rice and wheat under the public distribution system PDS towards high market price cereal items3 and to the depreciation of the rupee visvis the US relative to the September 2022 MPR baseline assumption II1 Consumer Prices Headline inflation dynamics in H2 reflected the interplay of volatile food price momentum and base effects4 The acceleration in headline inflation to 74 per cent in September 2022 an increase of around 40 bps from August came from a broadbased positive price momentum In October the headline inflation softened by around 60 bps to 68 per cent on account of strong favourable base effects across food fuel and core categories despite a further pickup in the price momentum Thereafter headline CPI momentum registered a decline driven by lower food prices This along with favourable base effects moderated headline inflation by close to 90 bps in November A further sharp correction in headline momentum in December despite an unfavourable base led to a second consecutive month of softening in headline inflation In January 2023 the positive price momentum in food and core categories and an adverse base effect pulled headline inflation up by 80 bps to 65 per cent In February the decline in food prices along with a favourable base effect led to a marginal softening in headline inflation to 64 per cent Chart II3 The distribution of CPI during 202223 revealed a pattern distinct from the previous year The mean of the distribution rose to 68 per cent in 202223 AprilFebruary from 55 per cent during 202122 while lower standard deviation and a lower positive skew pointed towards the generalisation of inflation pressures in the CPI basket Chart II4 and II5 The broadbasing of price pressures was also visible in CPI diffusion indices DIs5 which increased during September 2022 to January 2023 driven by CPI goods with some moderation in February Chart II6a The threshold DI6 for price increases remained in excess of 6 per cent on a seasonally adjusted annualised rate saar basis on an average during the last six months Chart II6b II2 Drivers of Inflation A historical decomposition of inflation using a vector autoregression VAR7 model indicates that supply shocks drove the inflation trajectory in H2 while monetary actions and aggregate demand conditions exerted downward pressure Chart II7a An analysis of supplyside costpush shocks suggests that while direct effects dominate in terms of their impact on headline CPI indirect effects can also be significant Box II1 Box II1 Domestic Costpush Price Shocks and CPI Inflation An Assessment using InputOutput Tables Elevated inflation and its persistence reflect a series of multiple supply side shocks It has been observed that as the direct impact of the shocks wane secondround effects can take hold causing generalisation of price pressures Moreover some sectors are systemically more important than others in this propagation mechanism Weber et al 2022 Direct and indirect effect of domestic costpush shocks to various sectors of the economy can be analysed by using inputoutput tables IOTs8 The IOTs are mapped to CPI itemssubgroups to understand the total impact in the CPI basket from a shock to each of the sectors The impact of the sectoral shocks on headline inflation is estimated by using the Leontief Inverse Matrix RBI 2022 ie where L is the Leontief inverse I is an identity matrix of dimension JK x JK A is the technical coefficient matrix derived from the IOTs and J and K are the total number of economies and industries The empirical analysis shows that a 1 percentage point shock to each of the sectors can raise CPI inflation by 146 percentage points with an indirect impact of 46 basis points Sectorwise shocks to agriculture have the maximum impact 41 bps on headline inflation followed by real estate 10 bps food products 8 bps and refined petroleum 7 bps Chart II11 Direct effects which depend on the size of the shock and weights of CPI items dominate The indirect effects on CPI inflation are relatively sizeable in the case of shocks to sectors like trade chemicals nonmetallic minerals and financial activities although these sectors have no direct impact as they are not part of the CPI basket Sectors like refined petroleum land transport pharmaceuticals and electricity have both direct and indirect effects on CPI inflation These findings can inform supply responses to recent inflation pressures References OECD 2021 InterCountry InputOutput Tables RBI 2022 Global CostPush Spillovers on Inflation Insights from World InputOutput Tables Box I2 Monetary Policy Report September

moderated it turned negative during November 2022February 2023 driven down by the yoy fall in in prices of edible oils LPG electronic goods parts polymer petrol and diesel Chart II7c CPI Food Group Inflation in food and beverages weight of 459 per cent in the CPI basket moderated from 84 per cent in September 2022 to 46 per cent in December on the back of sharp correction in vegetable prices alluded to earlier It however rose again to 63 per cent by February 2023 as increases in prices of cereals and products milk and spices outweighed the seasonal easing in vegetables prices Lower rabi production of wheat and spices lower kharif production of rice higher fodder and feed costs and a decline in wheat buffer stocks led to the hardening of prices of cereals milk and spices Chart II8 Excluding vegetables CPI food inflation rose from 70 per cent during SeptemberOctober 2022 to 90 per cent in February While the overall food price buildup in 202223 was lower than the historical experience the buildups in respect of five of the twelve subgroups cereals eggs spices milk and prepared meals were higher than their longterm averages Chart II9 Inflation in cereals weight of 97 per cent in the CPI and 211 per cent in the food and beverages group increased from less than 10 per cent in August 2022 to 167 per cent in February 2023 the highest in the current CPI series Chart II10 Wheat and rice were the primary drivers recording double digit inflation since June and October 2022 respectively Wheat prices hardened on the back of lower domestic production 17 per cent in 202122 due to the heat wave in major wheat producing states the dip in stocks and elevated global prices due to the conflict in Ukraine The release of a cumulative 34 million tonnes of wheat in the open market by the Government at a lower reserve price along with the higher estimated rabi production in 202223 an increase of 41 per cent has led to a gradual ebbing of price pressures The Government continued with restrictions on wheat exports since May 2022 and banning of exports of wheat flour from August 25 2022 to improve domestic supplies and ease price pressures Inflation in rice remained elevated due to decline in kharif production 26 per cent in 202223 Further exports also registered higher volumes 65 per cent yoy during April 2022January 2023 Inflation in vegetables prices weight of 60 per cent in the CPI and 132 per cent in the food and beverages group remained volatile during 202223 It moderated from a high of 182 per cent in September 2022 and entered into deflation in November on the back of an early onset of seasonal easing of price pressures reaching 116 per cent in February 2023 Onion prices remained in deflation throughout 202223 on account of higher production in 202122 an increase of 174 per cent record procurement buffer stock of 25 lakh metric tonnes in 202223 and better rabi crop prospects Potato price inflation however generally remained high during the year on lower production in 202122 50 per cent With stock releases from cold storages and arrivals of the kharif crop prices declined from November 2022 as per the seasonal pattern leading inflation to turn negative in February 2023 Imports of potatoes from Bhutan till June 2023 without the need for any import license also reined in price pressures Tomato prices exhibited high volatility due to a setback to production from heat wave in major producing states cyclone Asani in Andhra Pradesh and excessunseasonal rains Prices fell from November as per the seasonal pattern and on expectations of good production owing to increased sown area Chart II11 Inflation in prices of fruits weight of 29 per cent in the CPI and 63 per cent within the food and beverages group was relatively subdued averaging 45 per cent in 202223 AprilFebruary While prices of apples and coconuts barring February recorded deflation throughout inflation in banana oranges papaya and other fresh fruits remained elevated Inflation in prices of pulses weight of 24 per cent in the CPI and 52 per cent in the food and beverages group the primary source of plantbased protein rose from 26 per cent in August 2022 to 41 per cent in February driven by tur and urad on a decline in kharif production in 202223 by 131 per cent and 10 per cent respectively Chart II12 To augment supplies and contain price pressures the Government extended the period for free import of tur and urad to March 2024 increased the procurement ceiling under the Price Support Scheme PSS from 25 per cent to 40 per cent for tur urad and masoor and allowed disposal of chana to states at a discounted price under the PSS Government has stepped up monitoring of stock disclosures and futures trading in chana has been banned On the whole record pulses production during 202223 at 278 lakh tonnes and a higher stocktouse STU ratio augur well for domestic availability and effective price management Chart II13 Inflation in animalbased protein items increased sharply in H2202223 OctoberFebruary driven mainly by milk and products weight of 66 per cent in the CPI and 144 per cent within the food and beverages group Chart II14 Major milk cooperatives like Amul and Mother Dairy raised retail prices by 23 per litre in two and three spells since September 2022 respectively followed by other state cooperatives attributed to increase in feedstock costs Inflation in prices of eggs increased during November 2022January 2023 due to high feed cost and a spurt in exports to Malaysia before easing to 43 per cent in February 2023 After remaining muted during JulyNovember 2022 inflation in meat and fish weight of 36 per cent in CPI and 79 per cent within the food and beverages group increased to 60 per cent in January 2023 before moderating sharply in February 2023 due to a correction in prices as well as a favourable base effect Inflation in prices of oils and fats weight of 36 per cent in the CPI and 78 per cent within the food and beverages group which was elevated in the initial months of 202223 due to increase in global prices in the aftermath of the conflict in Ukraine and an export ban on palm oil by Indonesia eased considerably to 05 per cent in February 2023 Chart II15 This moderation was supported by easing global prices supplyside measures by the Government extension of reduction in basic customs duty on crude and refined oils and imposition of stock limits on edible oil and oil seeds and higher estimated domestic production of oilseeds in 202223 54 per cent Inflation in prices of sugar and confectionery weight of 14 per cent in the CPI and 30 per cent in the food and beverages group moderated sharply in September 2022 and remained muted in the subsequent months on the back of higher domestic production and export restrictions on sugar effective from June 1 2022 which was extended till October 2023 to ensure ample domestic supplies Among other food items inflation in prices of spices averaged 160 per cent during April 2022February 2023 reflecting production shortfalls in key spices especially dry chillies cumin and coriander in 202122 Prepared meals prices rose due to the gradual passthrough of past increases in input costs from edible oils LPG and transport costs Retail Margins Retail price margins the difference of retail and wholesale prices11 for cereals and pulses remained elevated during 202223 Retail margins rose for edible oils as decline in retail prices groundnut soyabean sunflower and mustard oil was less than that in wholesale prices Margins picked up in SeptemberNovember 2022 in the case of vegetables driven by all the three constituents ie potatoes tomatoes and onions Subsequently there was a sharp seasonal correction in prices and margins Chart II16 CPI Fuel Group CPI fuel inflation during September 2022 to February 2023 was high and sticky in a range of 99 per cent to 109 per cent While domestic LPG prices remained unchanged till February 2023 kerosene PDS prices fell after July 2022 in line with international prices Kerosene prices inflation moderated from around 60 per cent in September 2022 to 30 per cent by February 2023 Electricity prices on the other hand moved out of deflation in November 2022 and have remained largely steady since then Firewood and chips inflation pressures rose during Q3 before moderating in February Chart II17 Core CPI CPI excluding Food and Fuel Core inflation CPI inflation excluding food and fuel exhibited stickiness at or above 6 per cent in H2 Elevated inflation pressures were visible across all exclusionbased measures of core inflation Table II1 In 202021 high core inflation was due to price pressures in select categories like transport and communication and personal care and effects Since 202122 however it has become increasingly generalised and persistent Chart II18 During 202223 AprilFebruary core inflation averaged 61 per cent visvis 60 per cent in 202122 Between 202122 and 202223 the contribution of transport and communication and health to overall core inflation saw a decline but that of clothing and footwear edged up sharply along with an uptick in the contributions of household goods and services personal care and effects and education The contribution of core services increased during 202223 while that of core goods fell Chart II19 Retail selling prices of petrol and diesel remained unchanged during September 2022 to February 2023 Chart II20 Petrol and diesel prices moved into deflation on a yoy basis during AugustNovember 2022 and stood at 09 per cent in February resulting in a significant drop in transport and communication inflation and its contribution to CPI core inflation Chart II21 On the other hand gold prices firmed up yoy resulting in an increase in personal care and effects inflation and its contribution to core inflation Threshold diffusion indices for CPI excluding food fuel petrol diesel gold and silver indicate a high number of items registering price increases in excess of 4 per cent during SeptemberOctober 2022 Since November 2022 the diffusion index for items registering price increases in excess of 6 per cent saar has moved lower suggesting easing in the intensity of price increases Chart II22 A decomposition of CPI excluding food fuel petrol diesel gold and silver inflation into its goods with a weight of 207 per cent in the headline CPI and services weight of 230 per cent components shows that goods inflation averaged 74 per cent during September 2022 to February 2023 higher than services inflation of around 54 per cent The key drivers of goods inflation were clothing and footwear household goods and services and health Chart II23a In services inflation housing primarily house rental charges was the largest contributor followed by transport services bustramtaxi fares air fare and education tuition and other fees Chart II23b Trimmed mean measures12 also indicated elevated underlying inflation pressures with the weighted median inflation rate at 68 per cent during December 2022February 2023 Table II2 Other Measures of Inflation CPI inflation for agricultural labourers CPIAL and rural labourers CPIRL exceeded CPI headline inflation during September 2022 February 2023 primarily on account of food inflation being higher in CPIAL and CPIRL Inflation in terms of CPI for industrial workers CPIIW on the other hand was below the headline CPI during the same period due to lower inflation in food clothing and footwear housing as well as the miscellaneous categories in CPIIW visvis headline CPI After ruling in double digits between April 2021 and September 2022 wholesale price index WPI inflation moderated to 39 per cent in February 2023 on the back of a fall in international commodity prices and favourable base effects The sharp moderation in WPI inflation pulled down inflation measured by the deflators for gross value added GVA and gross domestic product GDP in Q3202223 Chart II24a While WPI inflation outpaced CPI inflation in the aftermath of COVID19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine it moved below CPI inflation since December 2022 During September 2022February 2023 CPI inflation ruled above the corresponding WPI groupssubgroups in respect of spices fruits proteinbased goods pulses egg and milk and clothing and footwear Deflation in edible oil and vegetable prices was higher in the WPI than in the CPI On the other hand inflation in fuel petrol and diesel was higher in the former visvis the latter Chart II24b13 II3 Costs Costs as measured by WPI inflation relating to industrial raw materials and farm inputs prices moderated gradually during H2202223 Chart II25 Inflation in the prices of industrial inputs such as highspeed diesel HSD naphtha aviation turbine fuel ATF bitumen and furnace oil eased mirroring the correction in international crude oil prices The prices of nonfood primary articles particularly raw cotton and oilseeds softened in tandem with international prices and expectations of higher domestic production Minerals price inflation moderated and turned to deflation from November 2022 driven by deflation in iron ore prices and in copper concentrate prices from January 2023 Notwithstanding the easing in HSD prices farm input price inflation remained elevated on account of high fodder price inflation Inflation in price of WPI electricity a key input in both industrial and farm inputs persisted at elevated levels reflecting higher input costs on the back of firmer international coal prices and increased domestic demand Nominal rural wage growth for both agricultural and nonagricultural labourers increased during October 2022January 2023 While agricultural wage growth was broadbased across all occupations the growth in nonagricultural wages was mainly driven by categories like beedi makers blacksmiths masons electricians and light motor vehicle LMVtractor drivers Chart II26 In the organised sector growth in overall staff cost yoy basis accelerated in Q3202223 for both manufacturing and services sectors The share of staff cost in the value of production for both manufacturing and services was broadly unchanged in Q3202223 from its level in Q2202223 Chart II27 As per the firms polled in the Reserve Banks enterprise surveys14 the pace of salary outgoes for the manufacturing infrastructure and services sectors is expected to remain broadly stable in Q1202324 Input cost pressures are likely to ease in Q1202324 and the pace of increase in selling prices is also expected to edge down for all the three sectors in Q1202324 Chart II28 One year ahead business inflation expectations15 that had risen in January 2023 edged down during February 2023 reflecting moderation in cost pressures As per manufacturing firms polled for the purchasing managers index PMI input prices picked up during DecemberFebruary and output prices in general moderated with the inputoutput price gap returning to positive territory by February The month of March saw a reversal in this trend with the gap again turning negative as input prices fell Chart II29a In PMI services input as well as output prices momentum softened during DecemberFebruary and the inputoutput price gap has been largely rangebound since August 2022 There was an uptick in prices charged in the month of March with softening in input prices leading to narrowing of input output price gap Chart II29b II4 Conclusion A combination of adverse supplyside shocks and the passthrough of pending input costs to output prices exerted sustained pressures on headline inflation during 202223 The outlook for 202324 is subject to uncertainties surrounding climaterelated disturbances such as heat wave and unseasonal rains Moreover a resurgence in geopolitical tensions could lead to supply chain dislocations and commodity price pressures per contra an earlier resolution of geopolitical hostilities can soften price pressures Global demand conditions are turning more uncertain amidst rising financial market turbulence and financial stability concerns which could weigh in on commodity prices Amidst these elevated uncertainties monetary policy remains focussed on progressively aligning inflation with the target Proactive supply measures by the Government remain vital to address bottlenecks and shortages in critical areas to mitigate volatility in inflation and enable a sustained disinflation 1 Headline inflation is measured by yearonyear changes in the allIndia consumer price index CPI produced by the National

items located in the tails of the inflation distribution items displaying changes more than the specified threshold in prices each month are excluded and the items dropped differ from month to month 13 The divergence in WPI and CPI petrol and diesel inflation emanated from the fact that while the cut in the central excise duties led to a fall in CPI petrol and diesel prices on a yoy basis WPI was not impacted as prices in WPI are computed net of domestic excise duty effects 14 Industrial Outlook Survey and Services and infrastructure Outlook Survey 15 Based on the monthly Business Inflation

stock of public capital Izquierdo A et al 2019 Serven 1999 Bahal et al 2015 RBI 2019 Against this backdrop the effect of public investment on private investment is investigated in a SVAR framework for 19802019 period Public investment private investment and GDP in real per capita are included in the model all variables in growth rates with global GDP growth as a control variable to account for external demand shocks The impulse responses indicate that a 1 percentage point increase in public investment increases private investment by 06 percentage point in the first year and the cumulative impact over a 3year period is over 10 percentage point Chart III21 The multiplier for public investment on private investment is 12 and on overall GDP is 17 over a threeyear period well over unity

during H2202223 amidst policy repo rate hikes moderating liquidity and recurrent bouts of global volatility impacting in particular equity and forex segments Bank deposit and lending rates moved higher Going forward the RBI will need to remain vigilant in mitigating the impact of global spillovers on domestic financial markets Introduction Since the September 2022 MPR global financial markets have remained volatile amidst protracted geopolitical tensions inflation remaining well above target across economies and aggressive monetary tightening Sovereign bond yields fluctuated widely in line with incoming data and high intensity banking turmoil events in March Equity markets in advanced economies AEs rallied on expectations of monetary policy pivots towards less restrictive stances with EME stocks mirroring global sentiments until the collapse of a few banks in the US triggered a flight to safety In the currency markets the US dollar eased from a twodecade peak and weakened against most currencies during October 2022January 2023 but gained in February on strong US data Volatility impacted EME currencies in an environment of risk aversion safe haven demand and correction in global equity markets IV1 Domestic Financial Markets In contrast domestic financial markets evolved in an orderly manner Money market interest rates hardened during H2202223 while bond yields were largely rangebound Equity markets exhibited twoway movements in H2 The Indian rupee INR depreciated visavis the US dollar Bank deposit and lending rates moved higher in response to monetary policy actions Bank credit growth remained in double digits throughout 202223 although it showed signs of slowdown from December 2022 IV11 Money Market Money market rates firmed up across maturities during H2202223 mirroring the increases in the policy repo rate and the ebbing of surplus liquidity Reflecting these developments the weighted average call money rate WACR on an average was broadly aligned with the repo rate 3 basis points bps above the repo rate in H2 as compared with 27 bps below in H1 Chart IV1 In the overnight call money segment the weighted average rate WAR on traded deals on an average was 5 bps above the policy repo rate while it was 15 bps below on reported deals1 during H2 Chart IV2a The average monthly volume of traded deals during H2 at 232 lakh crore was notably higher than 024 lakh crore in the reported segment Chart IV2b The share of reported deals in the total call money market volume declined to 5 per cent in March 2023 from 33 per cent in September 2022 due inter alia to the Reserve Banks directive to all eligible call money participants including cooperative banks to obtain NDSCALL membership the restoration of regular market hours and tightening liquidity conditions Within the money market the collateralised segments remained dominant The share of the uncollateralised call money market in total money market volume was 2 per cent in H2 Amongst the collateralised segments the share of triparty repo TREPS moderated to 71 per cent in H2 from 76 per cent a year ago while that of market repo increased to 27 per cent from 22 per cent Chart IV3 Among investors the share of mutual funds MFs the major lenders in the collateralised segment declined to 67 per cent in H2 from 71 per cent in H1 in the TREPS segment and to 40 per cent from 45 per cent in the market repo segment mainly because of reduced inflows under debt funds On the borrowing side the share of public sector banks PSBs in TREPS and market repo declined to 61 per cent and 15 per cent respectively in H2 from 65 per cent and 19 per cent in H1 The interest rates on longerterm money market instruments 3month Tbills TBs certificates of deposit CDs and commercial paper CPs rose in sync with the policy rate The spread of TBs over the policy repo rate at 30 bps in H2 was marginally higher than 25 bps in H1 while the spreads of CDs and CPs widened to 85 bps and 99 bps respectively from 46 bps and 63 bps amidst receding surplus liquidity and rise in risk premia2 during H2 Chart IV4 Banks continued to rely on CDs for funding with issuances of 38 lakh crore in H2 up to March 24 2023 on top of 30 lakh crore in H1 Resource mobilisation through CPs tapered from 73 lakh crore in H1 to 64 lakh crore in H2 revealing a preference for bank credit The weighted average discount rate WADR on CP issuances firmed up to 721 per cent in H2 from 553 per cent in H1 Chart IV5a Corporates remained the major issuers of CPs although their share declined to 42 per cent in H2

Securities Gsec Market During H2 Gsec yields were largely rangebound Chart IV6 Yields hardened in October 2022 tracking higher than expected domestic CPI inflation for September They moderated in November taking cues from softening US yields with a lowerthanexpected US CPI print and declining crude prices Overall the 10year benchmark yield softened by 7 bps in Q3 to close at 733 per cent In Q4 yields softened in early February on a lower than anticipated market borrowing programme of the central government for 202324 They hardened subsequently on higher domestic and US inflation prints and stronger US economic data In March the yields softened taking cues from US yields following bank collapses which drove investors to safe assets Overall the 10year benchmark yield fell by 3 bps to 731 per cent at endMarch 2023 The yields on Tbills firmed up across tenors in sync with the policy repo rate increases and moderation in surplus liquidity Chart IV7 The trading volume in Gsecs increased in H2 compared to the corresponding period of 202122 while it declined for Tbills over the same period Chart IV8 The weighted average yield on traded maturities for Gsec and Tbills increased by 107 bps and 293 bps respectively in H2 from their corresponding levels in H2 of the previous year The overall dynamics of the yield curve are captured by its level slope and curvature3 During H2 the average level of yields softened by 11 bps while the slope flattened by 70 bps due to relatively higher increase in shortterm rates consequent upon policy tightening mirroring global movements The curvature declined by 66 bps in response to yields hardening less in the midsegment of the curve than in the short and long segments Chart IV9 In the Indian context the level and curvature of the yield curve have more information content on future macroeconomic outcomes than the slope unlike in AEs4 In line with the announcement in the Union Budget for 202223 the Reserve Bank issued Sovereign Green Bonds SGrBs amounting to 16000 crore in two tranches of 8000 crore each on January 25 and February 9 2023 The proceeds are to be used exclusively for financing or refinancing new andor existing projects compatible with the environment andor climate To facilitate debt consolidation the Reserve Bank conducted five switch auctions on behalf of the Central Government amounting to 49387 crore

with Gsec yields The average yield on AAArated 3year bonds issued by nonbanking financial companies NBFCs and corporates increased by 57 bps to 812 per cent and by 49 bps to 807 per cent respectively in March 2023 over September 2022 The average yield on issuances by public sector undertakings PSUs financial institutions FIs and banks rose by 46 bps to 775 per cent Chart IV11a The risk premium measured by the spread over 3year Gsec yields increased from 42 bps to 73 bps for NBFCs from 45 bps to 68 bps for corporates and from 15 bps to 36 bps for PSUs FIs and banks in H2 Chart IV11b The increase in risk premia was seen across tenors albeit more at shorter segments and rating spectrum Table IV2 The average 3year credit default swap CDS spreads for State Bank of Indias paper trading overseas reduced by three bps while that of ICICI Bank moderated by four bps in H2 over H1 The primary market issuances of corporate bonds increased to 39 lakh crore during H2 up to February 2023 from 25 lakh crore during the corresponding period of 202122 offsetting the moderation in overseas issuances from 05 lakh crore in H2202122 to 01 lakh crore in H2202223 Chart IV12a Banks tapped the bond market to raise capital for their rapidly expanding balance sheets driven by the surge in credit demand Chart IV12b Nearly the entire resource mobilisation in the corporate bond market 987 per cent was through the private placement route The outstanding investments by foreign portfolio investors FPIs in corporate bonds declined marginally from 114 lakh crore at endSeptember 2022 to 104 lakh crore at endMarch 2023 pulling down the utilisation of the approved limits from 179 per cent to 155 per cent Chart IV12c The daily average secondary market trading volume during H2 up to February 2023 at 5332 crore was 77 per cent higher than in the corresponding period of the previous year Chart IV12d IV14 Equity Market In H2 domestic equity markets began on a positive note amidst strong buying by FPIs and robust corporate earnings The benchmark BSE Sensex touched an alltime high of 63284 on December 1 2022 In early Q4 rising US Fed terminal rate projections amidst tight labour market conditions dampened market sentiments Domestic equities remained under pressure in March 2023 amidst spillovers triggered by the banking turmoil in the US and Europe The BSE banking index the Bankex however gained by 09 per cent in March 2023 in contrast to declines of 252 per cent and 138 per cent in the US and European banking benchmarks respectively5 Overall the BSE Sensex gained 27 per cent in H2 to close at 58992 on March 31 2023 Barring brief phases of turbulence equity market volatility trended downwards with the India VIX which captures the shortterm expected volatility of Nifty 50

during H2 Chart IV14a In India foreign investors were net buyers in the domestic equity market in OctoberNovember 2022 attracted by robust earnings They however turned net sellers in DecemberFebruary on expectations of further monetary tightening by the US Fed and a selloff in shares of a large Indian business conglomerate Foreign investors turned net buyers in March Domestic institutional investors DIIs on the other hand were net buyers amidst steady retail participation through the Systematic Investment Plan SIP route enabling the market to remain resilient FPIs and DIIs were net buyers to the tune of 25027 crore and 110 lakh crore respectively in H2 Chart IV14b Activity in the domestic primary market remained subdued in H2 with issuers reconsidering IPOs amidst volatile market conditions Chart IV14c IV15 Foreign Exchange Market The appreciation of the US dollar triggered by aggressive rate hikes and the hawkish stance of the US Fed exerted depreciation pressure on EME currencies in H2 Chart IV15a Buffeted by these global spillovers the INR touched an alltime low of 832 per US on October 20 2022 It recovered in November 2022 riding on a depreciating US dollar and net inflows through foreign portfolio investments Since then it has remained largely rangebound The INR volatility measured by the 1month at the money ATM option implied volatility increased marginally from 529 per cent during H1 to 533 per cent during H2 Chart IV15b On a financial year basis the INR outperformed major EME currencies including the Argentine Peso the South African Rand and

Bank credit growth remained robust in H2202223 in tandem with economic activity Growth in nonfood bank credit accelerated to 154 per cent yoy as at endMarch 2023 from 97 per cent a year ago Chart IV18 With credit growth outpacing growth in aggregate deposits the incremental credit deposit ratio was above 100 per cent raising questions about the longterm sustainability of high credit growth Box IV1 While credit growth picked up across the board it remained higher for private sector banks PVBs 184 per cent visvis the PSBs 137 per cent Chart IV19a PSBs were however the major driver of the incremental credit extended by all scheduled commercial banks SCBs in 202223 Chart IV19b Credit offtake was led by personal loans and services6 While the share of personal loans in incremental credit offtake declined visvis the previous year the share of the services sector nearly doubled in February 2023 Chart IV20 Box IV1 Is Current Credit Growth High Bank credit growth reflects factors such as swings in economic activity the availability and cost of nonbank funding the relative cost of bank funding the banking sectors health and risk appetite Bank credit growth during 202223 was in large part a cyclical rebound from the subdued profile during the prepandemic year 201920 and the pandemic phase 202021 and 202122 While deposit growth trailed credit growth in 202223 the position was the reverse in the previous two years reflecting higher savings due to reduced spending on contactintensive services More recently deposit growth has accelerated partly boosted by higher deposit rates An econometric analysis of monthly nonfood credit and deposit data of all scheduled commercial banks SCBs for the period April 2007December 2022 shows that bank deposits and credit are cointegrated ie they comove over time7 The longrun elasticity of credit with respect to deposits is 094 attesting to this high degree of comovement The error correction coefficient is 008 and highly statistically significant with zstatistic of 394 which indicates that around 8 per cent of any divergence between credit and deposit growth is eliminated every month Despite the buoyancy in bank credit in 202223 the credittoGDP gap remains negative Chart IV11 Overall the credit growth is driven by a rebound in economic activity and is supported by an improvement in deposit growth Note Figures in parentheses are zstatistics Sectorwise growth in agriculture credit accelerated to 149 per cent yoy in February 2023 from 103 per cent a year ago Bank credit to industry rose by 70 per cent in February 2023 as compared with 67 per cent a year ago driven by large industries especially metals petroleum and chemical industries Credit growth to the infrastructure sector decelerated on the back of decline in credit to the telecom sector The MSMEs credit growth remained buoyant shored up by the Emergency Line Guarantee Scheme ECLGS that was extended till March 2023 Chart IV21 Services sector credit gained further traction in H2 propelled by flows to NBFCs both housing finance companies and others NBFCs With wholesale and retail trade included under the MSME category and easier access to loans under the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises CGTMSE credit to the trade sector registered accelerated growth in H2 Chart IV22 Retail loans remained the prime contributor to overall credit increase yoy in 202223 While credit to the housing sector recorded consistent expansion vehicle loan growth strengthened further Credit card loan growth was in high double digits throughout 202223 reflecting pentup consumption demand Chart IV23 The asset quality of SCBs improved during 202223 with the overall nonperforming assets NPA ratio declining to 45 per cent in December 2022 from 65 per cent a year ago Chart IV24a Asset quality improved across all the major sectors over the same period Chart IV24b Banks nonSLR investments ie investments in CPs bonds debentures and shares of public and private corporates were lower during H2 than a year ago as banks preferred to support the commercial sector through loans and advances Chart IV25a The growth in adjusted nonfood credit ie nonfood bank credit and nonSLR investments taken together accelerated to 139 per cent yoy in March 2023 from 91 per cent a year ago driven by nonfood credit Chart IV25b Excess holdings of statutory liquidity ratio SLR securities by banks moderated to 85 per cent of their net demand and time liabilities NDTL as on February 24 2023 from 104 per cent at endMarch 2022 as banks funded credit demand by shedding excess investments Chart IV26 Excess SLR holdings provide collateral buffers to banks for availing funds under the LAF and are also a component of the liquidity coverage ratio LCR IV2 Monetary Policy Transmission The pace of transmission of policy repo rate increases to deposit and lending rates of banks strengthened in H2202223 reflecting the combined impact of the external benchmark regime for loans the moderation in surplus liquidity in the banking system and credit growth persisting above deposit growth Banks revised upwards their external benchmarkbased lending rates EBLRs by 250 bps during May 2022 March 2023 in tandem with the increase in the policy repo rate The marginal cost of fundsbased lending rate MCLR the internal benchmark for loan pricing rose by 140 bps over the same period The weighted average lending rate WALR on sanctioned fresh rupee loans increased by 173 bps and that on outstanding rupee loans by 95 bps during May 2022 to February 2023 Table IV4 The external benchmark linked loans now dominate outstanding floating rate loans with their share in total increasing from 440 per cent in March 2022 to 483 per cent in December 2022 Correspondingly the share of MCLRlinked loans declined from 486 per cent to 461 per cent over the same period Table IV5 Within EBLR loans the RBIs repo rate is the preferred benchmark with a share of 81 per cent of all EBLR linked loans at endDecember 2022 The significant increase in the share of repo linked loans with shorter reset periods aided the pace of transmission to WALR on outstanding loans Across domestic banks the increase in the WALRs on fresh rupee loans was higher in the case of PSBs than PVBs during May 2022 to February 2023 Chart IV27a The lending rates of PVBs remained higher than those of PSBs Chart IV27b The transmission to lending and deposit rates was the maximum in the case of foreign banks reflecting a higher share of low cost and lower duration wholesale deposits in their total liabilities which facilitates faster adjustment in interest rates The WALRs increased across all the sectors during May 2022February 2023 Chart IV28 The spreads charged by domestic banks over the policy repo rate in the case of floating rate fresh rupee loans where the repo rate is the external benchmark moderated for personal and MSME loans during H2202223 Table IV6 The transmission to retail deposit rates gathered pace in H2 after remaining subdued in H1 as banks intensified their efforts to garner retail deposits to fund robust credit growth Chart IV29a The weighted average domestic term deposit rate WADTDR on fresh deposits including retail and bulk increased by 222 bps during May 2022 to February 2023 During H1 banks had focussed on mobilising bulk deposits This was reversed in H2 with the increase in fresh retail deposit rates 122 bps outpacing that in fresh bulk deposit rates 77 bps Chart IV29b The transmission to WADTDR on outstanding deposits is picking up albeit gradually reflecting the longer maturity profile of term deposits contracted at fixed rates The increase in term deposit rates in the current tightening cycle has exceeded that in lending rates Chart IV30a Savings deposit rates of banks which are a third of total deposits have however remained almost unchanged in the current tightening period Chart IV30b8 This has moderated the increase in banks overall cost of funds and helped in improving their net interest margins Chart IV30c Interest rates on small savings instruments SSIs administered by the government and linked to secondary market yields on Gsecs of comparable maturities were revised upwards by 1030 bps for Q3202223 20110 bps for Q4202223 and 1070 bps for Q1202324 after being left unchanged for nine consecutive quarters ie from Q2202021 to Q2202223 With these adjustments rates on most of the SSIs are closely aligned with the formulabased rates Table IV7 Banks term deposit rates are now competitively priced visavis post office term deposit rates Chart IV31 IV3 Liquidity Conditions and the Operating Procedure The RBI Act 1934 requires the Reserve Bank to place the operating procedure relating to the implementation of monetary policy and changes thereto from time to time if any in the public domain In consonance with the monetary policy stance of withdrawal of accommodation surplus liquidity moderated further in H2202223 On September 30 2022 the Reserve Bank announced the merger of the 28day VRRR with the fortnightly 14day main auction Amidst waning surplus liquidity the Reserve Bank conducted two variable rate repo VRR main operation auctions in FebruaryMarch and one finetuning VRR in March 2023 The Reserve Bank remained committed to meeting the productive requirements of the economy with flexibility on conducting operations on either side of the LAF depending on evolving liquidity conditions The standing deposit facility SDF which has been operational over the past year as the floor of the LAF corridor allowed the RBI to seamlessly absorb the surplus liquidity without being constrained by the availability of collateral Drivers and Management of Liquidity Currency in circulation CiC was the key driver of liquidity drainage during H2 CiC expanded by 22 lakh crore during H2 up to March 24 2023 driven by festival season demand Table IV8 This was partly offset by the net forex purchases 05 lakh crore and the pick up in government spending 03 lakh crore Banks drew down their excess CRR holdings 04 lakh crore which also augmented liquidity In terms of the management of liquidity OMO sales and the increase in cash reserve balances due to higher reserve base sucked out liquidity from the system during H2202223 Net average daily absorptions under the LAF moderated to 04 lakh crore during H2 from 33 lakh crore during H1 Chart IV32a The net LAF slipped occasionally into deficit mode in H2 triggered by frictional pressures from festivalrelated currency demand monthend GST outflows and quarterly advance tax payments In this regard net LAF injections increased to 105 lakh crore on March 17 2023 the highest since April 24 2019 142 lakh crore Amidst waninig liquidity surplus the amounts absorbed under the variable reverse repo rate VRRR auctions fell in H2 the average offercover ratio of the auctions was 026 was in H2 as compared with 040 in H1 Moreover banks also took greater recourse to the marginal standing facility MSF with daily average borrowings of 8438 crore during H2 as compared with 3448 crore during H1 Chart IV32b During 202223 MSF borrowings touched a high of 65646 crore on October 24 2022 The increased access to the MSF window even as large surplus funds were placed under the SDF reflected skewed liquidity distribution within the banking system To meet liquidity requirements the RBI conducted 14day VRR auctions on February 10 and March 10 2023 and a finetuning 5day VRR auction on March 24 An amount of 5000 crore was also made available to standalone primary dealers SPDs under the standing liquidity facility SLF on March 31 2023 at the prevailing repo rate with funds availed under this facility repayable on or before April 5 2023 With the periodic policy rate hikes accompanied by the progressive normalisation of surplus liquidity the WACR was closely aligned with the repo rate in H2 in

economic activity and expectations relating to the monetary policy path Since March 10 financial stability concerns following the collapse of a few banks in the US have imparted sizeable volatility to global financial markets bond yields crashed there has been a sharp correction in equity markets and the expectations of further monetary tightening yielded to pauserate cuts In equity markets the US SP 500 generally rallied in Q4 and January on expectations of less aggressive US Fed actions amidst some fall in inflation and strong economic data In February the market corrected on concerns of more tightening and rates remaining higher for longer after the release of robust US nonfarm payrolls and stronger inflation prints The correction continued in March after bank failures though it recouped

policy cycle Portfolio outflows exerted downward pressures on equities in EMEs Chart V6 Given the prominent role of the US dollar in the international economy US monetary policy surprises have a significant impact on global financial markets Box V1 Box V1 US Monetary Policy Surprises and Global Financial Markets In 2022 the US Federal Reserve undertook aggressive monetary tightening along with forward guidance of higher for longer which impacted financial markets across segments and geographies US monetary policy surprises can be proxied by the variations in the US overnight index swap rates OIS Lloyd 2018 Against this backdrop an interest rate surprise is identified by a change in 3month OIS rate Its impact on global equities and bonds markets both AEs and EMEs is modelled using daily data as where rt is the return on equity or bond index in US terms vixt is the JP Morgan global FX volatility index to capture global volatility sentimentt is the global sentiment index surprise is the difference of the 3month OIS from its previous day closing MSCI world AE and EME equity indices are used for calculating equity returns for the respective stock markets respectively while FTSE Government and FTSE Emerging Markets bond indices are used for calculating returns on bonds The empirical analysis focuses on the experience during 2022 and indicates that controlling for volatility and the prevailing global sentiment an unanticipated US monetary tightening reduces global equity as well as bond returns Table V11 As regards EMEs their bond markets turn out to be sensitive to US monetary surprises rising interest rate differentials in favour of the US can make EME debt assets less attractive and depress portfolio inflows Under these circumstances inflation management is complicated by the impossible trinity constraints and mobile capital flows seeking safe haven Patra 2022 References Lloyd S P 2018 Overnight Index Swap MarketBased Measures of Monetary Policy

Chinese bond yields firmed up modestly despite monetary accommodation In the currency markets the US dollar reversed its rally in October after hitting a twodecade high in September 2022 on perceptions of the Fed stepping down from its aggressive policy tightening Chart V8a However tight labour market conditions and strongerthanexpected inflation data led the market to assess that the tightening cycle may last longer strengthening the greenback in February The US dollar treaded down in March on financial stability concerns and expectations that the Fed may be forced to reverse its tightening cycle The US dollar dynamics were mirrored in the EME currencies with the volatility exacerbated by capital outflows Chart V8b The MSCI Emerging Market Currency Index gained 43 per cent in Q42022 and 19 per cent in Q12023 V5 Conclusion The risks to the global growth outlook are tilted to the downside The recent financial stability risks and global spillovers have imparted significant uncertainty to the economic outlook as policymakers juggle between sticky inflation on the one hand and financial stability risks on the other These developments are imparting sizeable volatility to global financial markets and generating large adverse spillovers on to emerging market economies through volatility in capital flows currency movements and bond yields posing downside risks to their

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1136&fn=2758,Date Role of Audit in the Modern Financial System,Like individuals businesses and banks the Governments also need a banker to carry out their financial transactions in an efficient and effective manner Managing Government banking transactions is a key function assigned to the Reserve Bank On the other hand banks need their own mechanism to transfer funds and settle interbank transactions such as borrowing from and lending to other banks and customer transactions As the Banker to banks the Reserve Bank fulfills this role It gives me great pleasure to be here at the National Academy of Audit and Accounts NAAA Shimla today to address the probationers and other officers of the Indian Audit and Accounts Service IAAS For the probationers this is a time when they are embarking upon a journey in the service of the nation as the principal flag bearers of accountability and transparency in public finance and governance 2 Civil Services play a pivotal role in the overall progress of a country They are the steel frame underlying the growth and development of our country Within Civil Services the Indian Audit and Accounts Service is responsible for auditing the accounts of the Union and State Governments and Public Sector Organisations It is also responsible for maintaining and auditing the accounts of the State Governments The audit mechanism has a crucial role in improving governance and transparency by operating the accountability framework for public expenditure 3 In a globally integrated economy fair and impartial audit is not just a domestic concern but also an instrument to enhance our reputation and credibility on a global stage It assumes greater significance during difficult times such as the one we are going through now due to the COVID19 pandemic With increasing complexity of financial markets and higher expectations from the public about efficient resource allocation the role of audit has become even more important As India aspires to grow faster the expertise and independence of auditors will have to be leveraged to provide more assurance on financial performance to all stakeholders We need robust audit for a dynamic and resilient economy 4 I have therefore chosen the theme of the Role of Audit in the Modern Financial System for my address today I propose to touch upon the areas relating to role of audit and its importance the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General CAG of India as an institution RBIs experience with audit as a regulator and supervisor in the financial sector why audit failures happen and the impact thereof adoption of modern audit tools and the changing nature of audit Origination of Audit 5 The early origins of the audit profession can be traced back to medieval Europe The Pipe Rolls collection of financial records maintained by the British Exchequer were some of the earliest written financial records of the audit process of the monarchys accounts The earliest surviving Pipe Roll at the National Archives of the United Kingdom covers the financial year 112911301 Since then the profession evolved organically out of the competitive dynamics of free markets It was however the development of limited liability companies during the 19th century in England and America that created a demand for professional accountants and auditors Prompted by insolvencies and scandals arising out of such limited liability companies especially Railway Companies the English Companies Act 1845 required for the first time semiannual audit of accounts of certain companies by an audit committee composed of shareholders2 6 In the Indian context accounting and auditing have a much longer history The Arthashastra written by Kautilya had prescribed detailed rules on accounting and auditing of public finances The Arthashastra refers to the collection and audit of all kinds of revenue and goes on to say that Accounts shall be submitted in the month of Ashdha Those accountants who do not present themselves in time or do not produce their account books along with the net revenue shall be fined ten times the amount due from them3 7 In much later history the Office of the Accountant General was established in 1858 which went on to become the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General As far as the private sector is concerned following the developments in Europe the Indian Companies Act 1866 made it mandatory for joint stock companies to get their accounts verified by an auditor at least once in a year Role and Importance of Audit 8 As you would be aware Audit can be defined as an examination of the books of accounts and records of an enterprise to certify that the profit and loss account and the balance sheet are properly drawn up so that it exhibits a true and fair view of the financial state of affairs of the business To delve into the need for audit we have to understand that economic decisions are increasingly made based on the available evidence and information 9 Inaccurate information may lead to suboptimal decisions or excess resource allocation which would be neither in public interest where a public authority is involved nor in the interest of individual stakeholders To give an example from the banking sector if a bank sanctions a loan on the basis of inaccurate and misleading financial statements and the borrower company is ultimately unable to repay the bank loses both the principal and the interest Apart from the loss incurred this could make the bank risk averse and deprive other eligible companies from bank funding Alternatively the bank may try to recover this loss by charging higher interest rate to other borrowers thus resulting in sowing seeds of nonviability in such borrowers apart from creating a situation of higher interest cost to the society Eventually at stake would be the safety of depositors money 10 To overcome the problem of unreliable information an assurance mechanism is required to be developed which provides independent assurance to the decision makers about the quality and accuracy of information being provided to them Such mechanism is provided through the audit mechanism both internal and external 11 Informative accurate reliable and analytical audit reports are sine qua non for both financial stability and growth The primary role of auditors is to resolve the Agency problems Agency problems arise due to information asymmetries between the Agent Management or the Government DepartmentsUsers of Public Funds and the Principal Shareholders Investors and the Public To resolve Agency problems one of the mostwidely used tools is to designate auditors to act as the gatekeepers be it for capital markets or for public funds Thus the independence of the auditor and the role of ethics in the profession of auditing are two of the most important aspects which should draw our attention 12 In case of the public sector auditing is a cornerstone of good governance By providing unbiased and objective assessments of whether public resources are managed responsibly and effectively to achieve the intended results a fair and impartial audit instils confidence among citizens and stakeholders As they say the reports of the public sector auditors should facilitate better oversight insight and foresight Oversight addresses whether public sector entities are doing what they are supposed to do as per the rules and procedures Insight assists the decisionmakers by providing an independent assessment of public sector programmes policies operations and results Foresight identifies the trends and emerging challenges Auditors can use tools such as financial audits performance audits and advisory services to fulfil each of these roles4 Role and Importance of the Institution of The Comptroller and Auditor General CAG of India 13 In a representative democracy such as ours public institutions function to serve the interest of the citizens whereby public funds are spent or invested for the common good The Comptroller and Auditor General CAG of India as the Supreme Audit Institution of the country serves as the critical link between the citizens and the Parliament on the one hand and the public institutionsdepartments on the other It subjects the practical conduct and operations of the public sector to regular and independent examination as well as review With such immense responsibilities the audit processes of the CAG through financial compliance and performance audits of public institutions do enhance the accountability and legitimacy levels for the use of public funds which are sourced primarily from the taxpayers in the country Based on the feedback given by the CAG future decisions on allocation of public funds are taken through timely identification of implementation gaps for course correction or for replication if the outcomes are successful Financial Sector Experience and Importance of Auditors 14 I am sure you would be picking up the ropes of Public Finance and Audit of Government and Public Accounts in your regular induction curriculum I would therefore like to give certain perspectives of the Reserve Bank as a financial sector regulator and supervisor on the audit function in banks nonbanking financial companies NBFCs and other financial entities 15 Stability and growth of an economy and financial markets are dependent upon trust among stakeholders One cannot take trust for granted With greater openness of the economy and faster transmission of information flows thanks to the advent of technology it has become paramount to ensure credibility and confidence in the system Statutory auditors play a vital role in maintaining market confidence on audited financial statements In banking industry this public role is particularly relevant for financial stability given that banks hold public deposits Audit quality is key to the effectiveness of such public role In addition the statutory auditor has a duty to report directly to the supervisor RBI on matters of material significance arising from the audit of banks and other regulated entities For these reasons RBI as the supervisor of banks and NBFCs has a keen interest in the manner with which statutory auditors perform audits in the regulated entities 16 The Reserve Banks supervision therefore specifically focuses on audit quality relating to identification of gaps assessment of asset quality and the socalled innovative accounting practices if any which could have a major impact on the capital base of regulated entities and their viability as a going concern Audit being the first external line of defence its failure in Supervised Entities will adversely impact timely identification of major issues and risks 17 The responsibility of risk management primarily rests with the Supervised Entities themselves however audit too has a critical role to play at the systemic level by examining the appropriateness of existing frameworks for plugging the control gaps and providing assurance to the Board and decision makers Audit Failures and their Impact on the Entity System 18 Without generalising it may be said that problems usually arise when the independence of auditors itself is compromised or the auditors lack competence in performing their role Compromising the independence of auditors could lead to moral hazard As such auditors are subjected to greater scrutiny and regulation so as to increase the reliability of their work 19 One of the important roles of audit is to check the so called smart accounting practices if any followed by management to overstate profits or understate expenses liabilities Let me give a few examples of such smart accounting practices that we have observed IndAS has been implemented for all listed companies other than banks in India including NonBanking Financial Companies NBFCs having net worth of more than 250 crore IndAS is a principlebased standard as against the previous accounting standards which were more prescriptive Within IndAS IndAS 109 with Expected Credit Loss approach allows the management to exercise discretion and judgement in determining the provisioning requirement for their financial assets Such flexibility and forwardlooking nature of assessment however poses the model risk ie the model may rely on incorrect assumptions and may be far away from representing the reallife scenarios This has been observed in several cases Hence auditors are expected to test the models used by the entities challenge the management and validate the model outputs Of late several instances of related party transactions without following armslength principle and established transfer pricing mechanism have been observed There have been instances of diversion of funds and or transfer of profits to connected parties through various means intragroup loans on favourable terms over or under invoicing of transactions asset transfers without fair valuation etc Auditors need to identify and thoroughly scrutinise related or connected party transactions to ensure that there is no undue transfer of income or assets We have also seen cases of manipulation and misstatement of true nature of financial statements by employing opaque technological means IT black boxes Real transactions are camouflaged beneath various layers of IT solutions by a few entities As such auditors need to be technologically savvy and be able to seethrough the layers of information technology to detect the real nature of hidden transactions 20 Such undesirable practices and structures should draw the attention of the auditors Since RBI as the supervisor of the financial system relies and leverages on the work done by auditors the audit professionals are being sensitized through various fora to improve the quality of their reporting We are constantly engaged with individual auditors audit firms and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ICAI to improve the quality and depth of audit A lot of work has been done in this area but lot more needs to be done Code of Ethics for Good Governance 21 A related issue is the importance of having a code of ethics for businesses to ensure that everyone in the institution is clear on the mission values and guiding principles Ethical behaviour goes beyond the minimum required by law and regulations This aspect is closely intertwined with the efficacy and robustness of various assurance mechanisms including audit The management has the responsibility for demonstrating through its actions the importance of ethical conduct While this is relevant for all businesses it is even more important for financial institutions which hold public trust and depositors money in fiduciary capacity The Reserve Bank has been repeatedly emphasising the importance of strong governance framework in banks and NBFCs Such a framework has to be built on principles of transparency prudent business strategy effective risk management and a strong compliance culture Financial sector entities the audit community and the financial sector regulators and supervisors have to work together and take proactive steps to ensure good governance and ethical practices to build a strong and resilient financial sector Adoption of Modern Audit Tools and Related Issues 22 In this digital era the manner of financial accounting and its consolidation has witnessed major transformations The auditing profession cannot afford to lag in adoption of technology Adopting technology tools such as Computer Assisted Audit Tools and Techniques CAATTs through constant upgradation and integration of new technologies will bring in a lot of efficiency in audits In parallel it has to be kept in mind that adoption of such technology tools for auditing cannot replace professional judgment A holistic approach would therefore be always required while integrating technology tools in audit Audit of Supervised Entities of RBI 23 Let me now move to some of the steps taken by the Reserve Bank of India over the past few years to bring about improvement in the audit function in its Supervised Entities i The Reserve Bank is clear that financial stability among other things depends on market confidence which stems from investor stakeholder confidence This in turn is influenced by the quality of financial reporting Our aim has been to ensure that banks make full and fair disclosure of all material information in their financial statements Some of these disclosures mandated by the RBI are as follows disclosures on the composition of regulatory capital so that stakeholders understand the quality of capital details of the quality of advances with provisions held thereon along with movement in nonperforming assets NPAs details of pending complaints the major grounds for complaints and their disposal ii In September 2020 RBI had revised the format for Long Form Audit Report LFAR to increase its utility value by enhancing the coverage of the prudential supervisory requirements stated in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision BCBS document on External Audits of Banks iii The RiskBased Internal Audit RBIA system in Scheduled Commercial Banks SCBs which was introduced in 2002 was further strengthened in January 2021 This was followed by issuance of guidelines for large NBFCs and Urban Cooperative Banks UCBs in February 2021 prescribing broad principles for such entities to gradually move towards the RBIA system iv In April 2021 the RBI has updated the guidelines for Appointment of Statutory Auditors in Commercial Banks UCBs and NBFCs putting in place ownershipneutral audit regulations for ensuring independence of auditors avoiding conflict of interest in auditor appointments and improving the quality and standards of audit 24 The RBI has also taken several measures to improve governance and risk management in banks and NBFCs These include issuance of updated guidelines on corporate governance in Scheduled Commercial Banks in April 2021 The role of Chief Risk OfficersCROs in SCBs has been strengthened and the requirement of CROs in large NBFCs and UCBs has been mandated Steps have been taken to simplify the complex group structures by implementing the Tapan Ray Committee recommendations relating to Core Investment Companies CICs A framework for scale based regulation of NBFCs has been announced on October 22 2021 Conclusion 25 With globalization and increasing complexity of the financial system audit as a public good has become vital for a sound stable and vibrant financial system Auditors need to update and upgrade skills on constant basis and perform their task in the most effective manner The profile of tomorrows auditor will be that of a critical yet constructive challenger with a clear focus on public interest and quality audits In essence there is need to be even more professional qualified impartial value driven ethical and also display awareness and foresight 26 I am sure all of you will act as torch bearers of the supreme legacy of the Civil Service and the institution of CAG and uphold the principles of accountability transparency integrity and equity which are essential features of a good Public Servant by imbibing the motto of the National Academy of Audit and Accounts commitment to truth for public good 27 With this I conclude and wish you all a very fulfilling career in the Indian Audit and Accounts Service 2 Report on Findings and Recommendations of the

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1094&fn=2753,Date Banking Landscape in the 21st Century,The Reserve Bank is the nations sole note issuing authority Along with the Government of India we are responsible for the design production and overall management of the nations currency with the goal of ensuring an adequate supply of clean and genuine notes It is indeed a matter of great pleasure for me to be here today in the Annual Banking Conclave of the Mint I am told that this is the 13th edition of Conclave in what has become a prestigious annual event attracting the best and brightest minds of the finance and banking industry This Conclave provides an important platform to all stakeholders in Indias financial and banking sector for assessing where we stand today and preparing ourselves for where we want to reach tomorrow 2 Several issues facing the Indian banking sector have occupied the attention of policy makers in the last few years Being a regulator and supervisor of banks the Reserve Bank stands committed to ensuring a sound and robust banking system in the country Emergence of new business models and new technology and its application in banking and finance have thrown up new opportunities With the aim of taking a deeper look at Indias banking sector in the context of these new developments the topic that I have chosen for my talk today is Banking Landscape in the 21st Century 3 Finance and banking have emerged as engines of global economic growth It is argued and in my opinion rightly so that technology has played a pivotal role in the proliferation of financial services1 Cheques wire transfers ATMs and credit cards were important innovations of such nature Fast forward to more recent times it seems that we are already witnessing yet another paradigm shift in banking on the back of a technological revolution that promises better customer experience risk management and returns to shareholders2 Given this environment it becomes extremely important to understand what it entails for the banking sector and how we can prepare ourselves for the times ahead Against this background let me now begin with discussing trends in global banking and then I shall dwell on some recent trends in Indian banking new dimensions of banking and way forward I Global Banking Emerging Regulatory Trends 4 The global financial crisis represents a watershed for the banking sector It exposed the inherent vulnerabilities of an otherwise formidable international financial system The crisis paved the way for an overhaul of the regulatory framework long lasting changes to the economic and financial environment and shifts in the competitive landscape of financial services industry 5 International standard setting bodies like the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision BCBS and the Financial Stability Board FSB were prompt in addressing the shortcomings of the precrisis regulatory framework Consequently many regulatory norms including leverage liquidity and capital adequacy were reviewed as part of the BaselIII reforms aimed at making the global financial system more resilient To address liquidity risk new instruments such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio LCR and the Net Stable Funding Ratio NSFR were introduced supplemented by large exposures framework capping large and risky exposures Aimed at addressing the Too Big to Fail TBTF problem the FSB phased in the Total Loss Absorbing Capacity TLAC for the Global Systemically Important Banks GSIBs to rebuild their capital buffers Various jurisdictions also adopted other key reforms initiated by the FSB such as sound resolution regimes for financial institutions and effective supervision of compensation practices Regarding nonbank financial intermediation NBFI the FSB has been conducting annual monitoring exercises since 2011 Broadly it has been observed that several aspects of nonbank financial intermediation which contributed to the financial crisis have considerably declined 6 Given the initiatives taken by the international bodies policy makers across jurisdictions have been fortifying their regulatory frameworks These policies are expected to pay back in the medium to long run by enhancing the soundness and resilience of the global banking system More recently with the global growth slowdown that began in 2018 credit growth being procyclical has decelerated across major economies This in turn has adversely affected bank profitability Despite distinct improvement in asset quality structural weaknesses like continued overreliance on investment in government securities in the Euro area and wholesale funding in many advanced economies remain Nevertheless capital position of banks has improved consistently in major advanced and emerging market economies on the back of various regulatory reforms introduced after the global financial crisis II Indian Scenario 7 At the Reserve Bank of India we have largely complied with Basel standards in terms of countercyclical capital buffer CCCB capital requirements for central counterparties CCPs leverage ratio framework Liquidity Coverage RatioLCR Net Stable Funding Ratio NSFR DomesticSystemically Important Banks DSIBs requirements and a Supervisory framework for measuring and controlling large exposures On the resolution front some progress has been made in terms of the notification issued by the Central Government under section 227 of the IBC We may however expect to have an integrated framework for resolution of financial firms operating in India in the near future The implementation of this reform is of particular importance for having a resilient financial system in India 8 In terms of recent progress the Indian banking sector is slowly turning around on the back of improvements in asset quality with enhanced resolutions through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code IBC Despite the recent decline in impaired assets and a significant improvement in provisioning profitability of the banking sector remains fragile Capital position of banks has however improved on account of recapitalisation of public sector banks by the Government and capital raising efforts by private sector banks Nevertheless the sector continues to encounter challenges from events like those around the telecom sector 9 Consequently the overhang of nonperforming assets NPAs remains relatively high which is weighing on credit growth Also in view of subdued profitability and deleveraging by certain corporates riskaverse banks have shifted their focus away from large infrastructure and industrial loans towards retail loans This diversification strategy while helpful as a risk mitigation tool has its own limitations Further sector specific pockets of stress need policy attention At the same time proper due diligence and risk pricing in lending is of prime importance so that the health of the banking sector is not compromised while ensuring adequate flow of credit to productive sectors of the economy 10 The banking stability indicator as reported in RBIs Financial Stability Report of December 20193 shows an improvement Timely mitigation measures like faster resolution better recovery etc need to be continued to bring down the gross nonperforming assets GNPA ratios of all scheduled commercial banks SCBs While lower rate of credit growth limits the size of the denominator for measuring GNPA risks arising out of global and domestic economic conditions and geopolitical developments persist III New Dimensions of Banking Emerging Structure of Banking 11 While global banking system is still in the process of addressing the gaps exposed by global financial crisis new issues have surfaced and challenged the very core of the traditional banking business Globally banks are facing increasing competition from nontraditional players which are taking advantage of digital innovation Banking structures across the globe are adapting to these new impulses 12 Numerous FinTech startups have formed spanning the banking and financial services industry They have entered the payments and remittance space in the sphere of peertopeer lending crowdfunding trade finance insurance account aggregation and wealth management Through collaboration with FinTech players several banks are applying a hybrid model where mobile services interact with banking services 13 Banks are not only facing competition from Fintech companies but also from large technology companies BigTechs which are entering into financial services industry in a big way Building on the advantages of the reinforcing nature of their datanetwork activities some BigTechs are venturing into payments money management insurance and lending activities At present financial services are only a small part of their business globally But given their size and reach their entry into financial services has the potential to bring about rapid transformation of the financial sector landscape It may of course bring many potential benefits Using big data BigTechs can assess the riskiness of borrowers reducing the need for collateral4 Hence their lowcost structure business can easily be scaled up to provide basic financial services to the unbanked population 14 These developments pose a challenge to banks as well as banking regulators Banks have to imbibe these new technology and business practices to remain competitive Banking regulators on the other hand have to focus on achieving a balance between promoting innovation and applying a measuredproportional supervisory and regulatory framework All these mean that the future of banking will not be a continuation of the past We would see a very different banking sector in terms of structure and business model in the coming years 15 So what would be a possible scenario in India Distinct segments of banking institutions may emerge in the coming years The first segment may consist of large Indian banks with domestic and international presence This process will be augmented by the merger of Public Sector Banks PSBs The second segment is likely to comprise several midsized banking institutions including niche banks with economywide presence The third segment may encompass smaller private sector banks small finance banks regional rural banks and cooperative banks which may specifically cater to the credit requirements of small borrowers in the unorganised sector in rurallocal areas The fourth segment may consist of digital players who may act as service providers directly to customers or through banks by acting as their agents or associates The reoriented banking system will of course be characterised by a continuum of banks The banking space would also include both traditional players with strong customer base and new technology led players 16 In the context of the emerging scenario a properly worked out consolidation of public sector banks can generate synergies in allocation of workforce and branches as well as streamlining of operations to meet the future challenges The focus has to be on ushering in significant improvements in efficiency and rationalisation of scarce capital to meet the capital adequacy requirements Investments in technology and skill building has to be stepped up Bigger and agile banks may be able to reposition themselves with better branding exercises backed by improved technology skills and business models 17 Ultimately the strength of a banking system depends on the strength of its corporate governance that fosters a robust and ethicsdriven compliance culture In this context the Reserve Bank has been issuing instructions on corporate governance For example the compensation guidelines for whole time directors CEOs and material risk takers of banks have also been substantially modified Largescale divergences and frauds observed across banks raises questions on the role and effective utilisation of internal control systems within banks to identify areas of emerging risks The RBI has issued the revised guidelines on the concurrent audit system in banks drawing from the recommendations of the Expert Committee under Shri YH Malegam The guidelines are aimed at strengthening the internal control functions enjoining greater responsibility on the audit committees of the Boards while providing them greater leeway Besides RBI would also issue draft guidelines on corporate governance in banks as indicated in our annual report and reiterated in the report on trends and progress of banking in India 201819 published in August 2019 and December 2019 respectively Digital Disruptions 18 Besides structural changes digital disruptions will continue to transform the banking sector Initiatives undertaken by the Government the Reserve Bank and the industry have led to a radical shift towards ubiquitous digitization which has provided an impetus to adoption of technology There is a unique confluence of several positives like demographic dividend JAM trinity etc that would further support rapid digitisation of financial services in India 19 With inroads into their traditional businesses banks are expanding into newer areas such as insurance asset management brokerage and other services It is heartening to note that the mindset of banks is changing and they no longer view FinTech firms as disruptive This change in approach has provided the financial services sector a sense of security There is evidence that Fintech companies are acting as enablers in the banking ecosystem Banks are relying on a number of strategies to embrace technological innovation ranging from investing in FinTech companies and founding their own FinTech subsidiaries to collaborating with Fintech companies Banks and nonbanks are partnering to offer the combination of trust and innovation to the Indian consumer This best of both worlds approach has resulted in tremendous growth in the number of digital payments which is expected to continue These strategies can effectively ensure that banks retain market share as customers increasingly value more efficient and costeffective services 20 In the light of these developments conventional banking is making way for nextgeneration banking with a focus on digitisation and modernisation The need for brick and mortar branches is being reviewed continuously as digitisation has literally brought banking to ones fingertips obviating the need to physically visit a bank branch for most of the banking services 21 The movement towards digital payments has also been facilitated by introduction of fast payment systems such as Immediate Payment Service IMPS and Unified Payment Interface UPI which provide immediate credit to beneficiaries and are available round the clock The extent of digital penetration can be gauged from the fact that each day on an average the payment systems in India process more than 10 crore transactions of nearly INR 6 lakh crore Today digital payments account for around 97 per cent of daily payment system transactions in terms of volume This has been made possible with an accelerated growth of over 50 per cent in the volume of digital payment transactions in the last five years 22 The Reserve Bank has recently started operating its retail payment system viz National Electronic Funds Transfer NEFT on a 24x7 basis This is a game changer and places India among very few countries which provide this facility The Bank for International Settlements BIS in a recently published paper has indicated that the UPI framework of India can become an international model to facilitate quick and seamless payments not only within countries but even across countries There is considerable interest at International fora to understand and learn from our experience in furthering digital payments and we are very glad to share and collaborate The National Payments Corporation of India NPCI has also decided to set up a subsidiary to focus on taking the UPI model to other countries which will help enhance global outreach of Indias payment systems With a view to encourage competition and further innovation in the retail payments space we have also placed on our website a draft framework of a panIndia New Umbrella Entity NUE for retail payment systems for public comments Strengthening Regulation and Supervision 23 In the context of ever expanding dimensions of the banking sector in the 21st century we need to be aware of the extensive regulatory and supervisory reforms essential for ensuring stability and inclusiveness of the banking sector It has been RBIs endeavor to constantly improve the efficacy of its supervisory and regulatory functions so that the resilience of the regulated financial entities can be enhanced A number of steps have been taken in the recent past in this regard In particular we have reorganised the supervisory and the regulatory departments of the Reserve Bank with the aim to improve coordination and allocate resources more optimally From a supervisory perspective this will augment the identification of systemic and idiosyncratic risks which will help us build synergy between offsite and onsite supervision teams 24 We are also following a calibrated supervisory approach to bring in required modularity and scalability to better focus on risky practices and institutions and to deploy an appropriate range of tools and technology to achieve our supervisory objectives We are focusing on a sharper and more forwardlooking offsite surveillance framework as an aid to our onsite supervision A Suptech initiative is being implemented as a part of the integrated compliance management and tracking system This will facilitate transparent and efficient monitoring of all pending compliances of supervised entities through a webbased interface automate the inspection planning process and cyber incident reporting and ensure seamless collection of data Thematic studies will be undertaken across banks and other financial sector entities New elements of supervision will also be introduced from time to time The proposed Research and Policy Division and Risk Specialists Division will assist in this process 25 Appropriately recognising the systemic importance of nonbanking financial companies NBFCs and their interlinkages with the financial system the Reserve Bank has taken necessary steps to ameliorate the concerns relating to their asset quality and liquidity The amendment to the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 effective August 1 2019 has further empowered the Reserve Bank to constructively intervene in the operations of NBFCs The assetliability management ALM position and other relevant aspects of top 50 NBFCs are being closely monitored which covers all NBFCs with asset size above 5000 crores The ALM of top 51100 NBFCs is also being examined by the respective regional offices of the Reserve Bank 26 In addition to the four pillars of supervision viz onsite inspection offsite surveillance market intelligence and reports of Statutory Auditors SAs a fifth pillar of supervision in the form of periodic interaction with all the stakeholders including statutory auditors credit rating agencies credit information companies mutual funds and banks having large exposures to NBFCs has been instituted to have a clearer understanding of the emerging risks and developments in the sector so that critical information is available whenever required 27 As regards the cooperative banking segment we have developed a robust stresstesting framework for urban cooperative banks UCBs It also acts as an early warning system for cooperative banks with the purpose of timely identification of weak banks for appropriate action This is a shift from reactive to proactive supervisory approach intended to ensure surveillance of vulnerabilities in UCBs on an ongoing basis Moreover as on December 31 2019 more than 90 per cent of these banks are now on Core Banking Solution CBS although efforts are still required to standardize the solutions and have robust set of internal controls implemented in the CBS for improved outcomes The CAMELS Capital Asset Quality Management Earnings Liquidity and Systems and Control supervisory rating methodology for UCBs has also been comprehensively revised We have also taken steps to bring UCBs under the CRILC reporting framework and issued draft guidelines on exposure norms to mitigate credit concentration risk and enhancement in Priority Sector lending targets to further financial inclusion To improve governance we have issued guidelines on constitution of Board of Management BOM for UCBs with deposit size of Rs 100 crores and above while making it voluntary for adoption by other smaller UCBs Further in order to have appropriate regulatory powers for RBI in respect of cooperative banks almost on par with those over banking companies certain amendments in the Banking Regulation Act 1949 have been proposed IV Way Forward 28 The changing landscape of the banking industry will unfold in the backdrop of a strong regulatory and supervisory regime with increased intensity and techenabled supervision of banks The challenge before banks is to make the best use of technology and innovation to bring down intermediation costs while protecting their bottom lines Further Artificial Intelligence AI Machine Learning ML and Big Data are becoming central to financial services innovation They can also help in fraud detection and in identifying better ways of monitoring use of funds by borrowers track suspicious transactions etc by processing large datasets 29 One of the challenges for policy makers especially in countries like India is to ensure that new innovations in banking sector serve the customer by reducing the cost of financial services and enhancing the range and access to products in a manner that is safe Advanced analytics and realtime monitoring of emerging cybersecurity risks will be critical in detecting potential threats and enabling preemptive action 30 As the Indian banking sector is propelled forward to a higher orbit banks would have to strive hard to remain relevant in the changed economic environment by reworking their business strategies designing products with the customer in mind and focusing on improving the efficiency of their services The possibilities are enormous We should be seized of the issues and act in time 1 Arner D W Barberis J Buckley R P 2015 The Evolution of Fintech A New Postcrisis Paradigm Georgetown Journal

Government of India we are responsible for the design production and overall management of the nations currency with the goal of ensuring an adequate supply of clean and genuine notes Mr Tom Ferguson Chairman Banknote Conference 2014 Mr Tim Vigotsky Director Banknote Conference 2014 my fellow speakers Mr Barna Barabas DMD Jura Security Printing Alliance Dr Wolfram Seidemann Managing Director Louisenthal other delegates ladies gentlemen At the outset I thank the organizers of Banknote Conference 2014 for inviting me to speak at this august gathering From the contents of the Conference Schedule and from the feedback that I have received from my colleagues in the Reserve Bank of India who have participated in this Conference over the years I gather that the Conference seeks to serve certain useful purposes notably providing a platform for a free and frank exchange of views showcasing the latest developments in the rapidly changing field of currency management bringing together the service providers and the service seekers from across the world under one roof and generally helping the participants to chalk out their future strategies and plans of action 2 Because of the sheer size of our population and the quantum of banknotes that we are required to put into circulation every year India has emerged as one of the biggest consumers of the ingredients that go into production of banknotes in the world In keeping with the magnitude of the banknotes that are put into circulation the corresponding need to import other machinery for processing detection and destruction of the bank notes is also humongous Thus India is a very significant market for the suppliers of all ingredients and equipments which form the entire ecosystem of the banknote production and destruction process As incharge of the currency management function in the country we at the Reserve Bank of India the Central Bank of the country have experienced severe constraints some of which can be traced directly or indirectly to the operations of the global suppliers and vendors in the banknote industry I intend to use the presence of these global suppliers and vendors and the opportunity to speak at this platform today to highlight some of these concerns which I feel must be bothering other Central Banks which rely on imports for their currency management especially in the emerging markets I would be extremely happy if the suppliers vendors could reflect on our concerns and develop some practical solutions to our problems However before I get into the specific issues let me begin with a brief perspective on various dimensions of the Indian currency system and the issues and challenges that we face in our currency management efforts I would also like to share some of the recent steps we have taken in this area with a view to seeking your views and feedback for improvements Introduction 3 Currency management has a great degree of significance for Central Banks the world over as it is one of the most visible functions which touches the lives of every individual Since people often tend to judge the efficacy of the central bank from the ease of continuous access and quality of notes in their possession currency management function entails a certain degree of reputational risk for the central bank As is the case in most jurisdictions issue of banknotes and management of currency is one of the core functions of the Reserve Bank of India It is enshrined in the preamble to the RBI Act 1934 as to regulate the issue of Bank Notes and keeping of reserves with a view to securing monetary stability in India and generally to operate the currency and credit system of the country to its advantage 4 The mandate of any central bank is to protect the integrity of banknotes through new design and security features estimate the demand for banknotes and coins plan the supply and distribution of adequate quantity of banknotes and coins and ensure quality of banknotes in circulation by timely withdrawal of soiled banknotes It is equally important to maintain confidence in currency through improvement in systems procedures and by raising public awareness by enlisting support from all associated with the design production and supply of banknotes Some Numbers 5 There has been a steady increase in the demand for banknotes and coins over the years despite the increased use of technologydriven noncash modes of paymentsecurrencyvirtual currencybit coins etc Even internationally notes in circulation have been increasing despite the use of noncash modes of payment However the large numbers in India present a unique situation as compared to other countries A comparative picture of the Notes in Circulation NIC in India as compared to some major countries is indicated in the table given below Year 201213 India US UK Euro zone Australia Canada No of Pieces in billion 7647 345 299 158n 115 200 Value in home currency terms 12468 billion 1198 billion 58 billion 9337 billion 536 million 637 million 6 Globally the cash in circulation to GDP ratio has ranged from 25 to 8 whereas in India it has been around 13 due to the predominant usage of cash by a majority of the population The worldwide growth rates of cash in circulation has varied between 6 and 13 with Central South America figuring at the top end followed by Africa 12 Middle East 11 Europe 10 Asia 7 and finally UK and Ireland at 6 In the year 2013 154 billion banknotes were issued globally of which the maximum banknotes 54 billion were issued by China and almost 20 billion banknotes by India The global projections for the next three years have been worked out at 160 billion 166 billion and 173 billion banknotes respectively These numbers are simply astounding While it presents a massive opportunity for the vendors associated with the production of banknotes I believe it simultaneously enjoins upon them certain responsibilities For instance the vendors need to be conscious of the impact of their activities on the environment I will touch upon some of these issues later in my address At this stage I would like to mention that there needs to be more investment in research and development efforts by the vendors to ensure that the longevity of the banknotes improves and eventually the cost of printing of banknotes for the society as a whole comes down Vendors need to develop such banknote paper that can resist dirt and moisture thereby increasing the life and quality of the banknotes in circulation But while the focus needs to be on bringing down the cost of printing banknotes it cannot be done by compromising on security In fact effort has to be on making the banknotes more secure with lesser but stronger security features Currency Management in India Major Challenges 7 Let me now share with you some of the challenges that we encounter in currency management and currency distribution in India In a country like India having an area of approximately 33 mn sq km and a population of more than 12 billion reaching the currency to the end users in far flung areas dotted with difficult terrains poses an enormous challenge As on December 31 2013 there is a network of 110520 commercial bank branches and 137080 ATMs The notes in circulation as on the same date was approximately 7647 billion pieces valued at 12 468 billon while the coins in circulation were around 8991 billion pieces valued at 168 billion As the demand for notes and coins is subject to diverse socioeconomic behavioural and other often unpredictable factors the task of forecasting demand for currency is a challenging task and can be subject to large variations At present the system poses considerable difficulties in capturing the structural and cyclical demands for currency and projecting demand with precision I would therefore also take this opportunity to extend an invitation to the delegates present here to come forward and see if they can work with us for making accurate projections for the demand of banknotes and coins 8 The other challenges in currency management relates to ensuring durability of banknotes ensuring adequate supply of all denominations improving operational efficiency in distribution of notes by controlling cost of handling distribution and security in transit storage providing last mile connectivity at reasonable cost ensuring equity in distribution and repositioning RBI as an upstream facilitator in the fresh notecoin supply chain rather than as a retailer with limited reach Let me highlight the challenge associated with durability of the banknotes in India by giving some figures We in India withdraw more number of banknotes from circulation than the number of banknotes collectively produced by all countries taken together with the exception of China In fact we are constrained to withdraw over 75 of all notes that we circulate every year as may be seen from the table below Supply of Banknotes by RBI to Currency Chests and disposal of Soiled notes Denomination VolumeMillion Pieces 201011 201112 201213 Supply Disposal Supply Disposal Supply Disposal 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1000 706 179 371 375 1536 450

17677 13852 17600 13771 18866 14130 78 78 75 9 Such massive withdrawal of banknotes from circulation not only means additional cost for printing of fresh notes but also additional requirement of various resources used in production of banknotes In this context it becomes imperative that efforts are made to enhance the durability of the banknotes so that not only the wastages are reduced but also resources are utilized in a sustainable manner thereby ensuring that the environmental footprint of our currency management operations is minimized 10 Mechanization of soiled note processing while augmenting capacity has also thrown up new challenges like ensuring standardization of machine parameters slow progress in improvement in processing capacity by commercial banks and security risks on account of manual intervention Another challenge with the likely potential to evolve into a reputational risk for RBI is the shortage perceived shortage of coins and the lack of understanding on the exact role of the central bank in its distribution It needs to be understood that while the responsibility for issue of coins is that of the Government of India GoI RBIs role is restricted to putting into circulation the coins received by it Then there are issues arising out of similar shapes and sizes of coins of different denominations Last but not the least is the growing menace of forged notes in circulation and creating public awareness about various aspects of banknotes Recent Measures in India a Constitution of High Level Committee 11 To address the significant challenges faced by us in India and other related issues a High Level Committee was recently constituted by GoI Chairman Dr K C Chakrabarty having members representing GoI RBI Note Presses Mints The Committee reviewed the forecasting methodology and studied the international best practices in cash distribution by other Central Banks It made wideranging recommendations notably i RBI to focus exclusively on management and planning of currency system while passing on the responsibility for distribution of banknotes and coins entirely to commercial banks ii need to introduce private entrepreneurs for distribution of banknotes and coins on behalf of banks if last mile connectivity for distribution has to be achieved iii identification of a bank willing to assume leadership of currency management function in the district etc All these recommendations have been accepted and are at various stages of implementation b Distribution Mechanism 12 The functions relating to issuance of currency both banknotes and coins and their management is performed by the Reserve Bank through its 19 issue offices and a network of 4209 Currency Chests and 3966 Small Coin Depots spread across the country Despite the large number of currency chests extended arms of RBIs Issue Department the primary responsibility for reaching currency to the banks rests with RBI because of the currency management structure Every year based on the Banks indent for banknotes and coins the Printing Presses and Mints dispatch notes and coins to the RBI offices From the RBI offices the notes and coins are remitted to currency chests operated by commercial banks The central bank arranges for transport and police escort for transfer of treasure and bears all the expenditure related to it unlike other countries where the commercial banks are responsible for transport of cash Thus distribution of cash in India is the primary responsibility of the central bank The treasure held in the currency chests is the property of the central bank and is subject to auditverification Any withdrawal or deposit in the currency chest by the bank holding the chest is reflected as debitcredit in the banks account held with RBI 13 To improve last mile connectivity we have decided to involve private entrepreneurs in the distribution function The Cashin Transit CIT companiesBusiness Correspondents have been allowed to process coin and banknotes including packaging sorting and delivery to banks customers and for retrieval Banks including urban cooperative banks and regional rural banks are also being involved to ensure that last mile delivery of cash related services penetrates throughout the country We have also initiated a pilot exercise under the lead bank scheme for currency management and intend to upscale it going forward based on the experience gained c Direct remittance of banknotes 14 At present remittances of notes from printing presses accompanied by press representatives and police escort are received at our Issue Offices After receiving these boxes they are subjected to preliminary verification PV wherein the contents of the box are verified by the vault joint custodians in the presence of the press representative Later at the time of sending remittance to banks packing of the boxes is done in the presence of the accompanying RBI staff and vault joint custodians At the bank the RBI staff remains stationed till the verification of notes is completed by the bank officials 15 We have realized that the present process has some inherent inefficiency as the currency notes have to be transported several times before they reach the public This not only reduces productivity but is also costinefficient Accordingly we have introduced a scheme for direct remittance of banknotes from Banknote Printing Presses to the commercial banks instead of routing them through RBI Issue offices to save time efforts and resources The new process is being given greater impetus by the RBI d Pursuit of Clean Note Policy 16 Since the year 1999 the Bank has been pursuing a Clean Note Policy to ensure an uninterrupted supply and circulation of good quality banknotes As may be seen from the Table at para 8 above during the last three years 13852 million pieces mpcs 13771 mpcs and 14130 mpcs respectively of soiled banknotes were withdrawn and disposed of While the objectives of Clean Note Policy have been by and large achieved in respect of higher denomination notes the quality of lower denomination notes especially 10 continues to be a cause for concern possibly due to reluctanceconstraints on the part of banks to mop up such notes from circulation 17 To ensure that genuine banknotes alone are put into circulation high priority is accorded to detection of counterfeit notes in the banking system Towards this end banks have been directed to enhance the use of technology to realign their cash management systems so as to ensure that cash receipts in the denominations of 100 and above are not put into recirculation without being machine processed for authenticity Banks have also been advised to put in place suitable systems to ensure that counterfeit notes detected are duly impounded and reported by following the prescribed procedure e Currency Processing in India Trends in Expenditure 18 The currency production costs in our country have been substantial over the years We in RBI have incurred an expenditure of 2376 billion in 201011 2736 billion in 201112 and 2872 billion in 201213 on this activity The two note printing presses BRBNMPL and SPMCIL exhibit an increasing trend in their overall expenses viz 1222 billion 1309 billion and 1423 billion in the case of the former and 2617 billion 2788 billion and 3282 billion in the case of the latter during the last three years respectively with the cost of paper and ink contributing significantly in the overall costs Additionally RBI has incurred an expenditure of 523 billion for acquisition upgradation and overhaul of its 59 CVPS machines and 28 SBS Shredding and Briquetting system machines employed for destruction of soiled notes The Road Ahead Key Messages 19 Currency management offers significant business opportunities for the players as the cost of printing of banknotes is increasing every year due to the increasing demand for banknotes As I mentioned earlier this also enjoins certain amount of responsibility on the part of the vendors It is expected from them that the products offered are of high quality and reliability and they strictly adhere to the agreed technical specifications In this context I wish to allude to the failure of the selected bidders in meeting the technical specifications of the plastic banknotes in 10 denomination that we are proposing to introduce on a trial basis in India necessitating undertaking the exercise afresh thereby delaying the process The vendors are also expected to cooperate with the national governments and Central Banks to avoid production of counterfeits by developing countryspecific security features and bringing about improvisation in raw materials like paper ink thread etc Any failure of the vendors in this regard could result in total loss of business with individual countries making efforts to indigenize 20 Let me now focus your attention on some expectations that we have from the various vendors present in the Banknote Conference here We all agree that the integrity of banknotes is the most important factor In this context it is also actually quite ironical that for the circulation of forged notes the blame is put on the central bank when in fact the blame should go to the manufacturer of the forged notes as in the case of spurious drugs where the manufacturers are prosecuted However it is my considered opinion that the integrity of the banknotes is not a technology issue but more of a law and order issue When I say this I feel I would be echoing the sentiments of all consumers of various products that the industry produces especially the representatives of the emerging market countries who rely heavily on imports for currency production in their respective jurisdictions I firmly believe that upgrading the security and design features of the banknotes every few years to outsmart the counterfeiters is not a longterm solution but only adds to the cost of producing the banknotes 21 Let me elaborate what I mean If the counterfeiters are able to do a good job of producing duplicate currency they are obviously having access to good quality currency paper printing ink and other components that are necessary for production of banknotes So the question is what is the source of supply for the fraudsters and what is the role of vendors in perpetration of these unlawful activities The commercial banks the world over follow stringent KYC procedures on their customers As counterfeiting is a global issue what I would like the vendors present here is to similarly do a proper customer identificationdue diligence on all their customers The vendors must join hands to find out who has supplied ink paper machinery etc to the counterfeiters which would enable the regulators to take appropriate action In a manner the banks close accounts of customers doing any doubtful transactions the suppliers should be able to cut off their links with their doubtful customers In fact the need of the hour is that counterfeiting should be tackled as a criminal activity with active coordination and collective might of all stakeholdersthe vendors Central Banks law enforcement agencies etc Finding a longterm solution to this menace may also require close crossborder cooperation between various countries The global vendors have in fact the maximum stake in ensuring that these problems are countered at the earliest Over time the vendors have made significant investments in building capacities and in the process created economies of scale and scope They are the least cost producers of the various ingredients components used in production of banknotes and any attempt by individual countries at creating manufacturing capacities could prove inefficient and in many cases wasteful investment But the bottom line is that any failure to initiate necessary corrective measures would push more and more countries like India to go for indigenization thereby resulting in loss of big business for the vendors 22 The global banknote industry comprising various manufacturers of machines paper ink security features etc is very huge I understand that the overall market for this industry is roughly USD 27 to 28 billion So while the opportunities for the vendors are immense I would also take this opportunity to request all the manufacturers suppliers vendors in the banknote industry to put their minds together and come up with ideas on not only reducing the cost of paper ink machines etc but also for enhancing the durability of the banknotes through technological innovations The vendors must realize that they also have a responsibility towards the environment These innovations are necessary to reflect that the vendors are conscious about promoting environmental sustainability and green practices Thus it is extremely significant that currency production activities are not viewed as mere business proposition for the vendors but also as something which has serious implications for the reputation of all stakeholders the national governments Central Banks and the vendors themselves 23 I once again thank the organizers for the opportunity provided to me and appreciate the patient hearing given by the participants I hope that the delegates present at the Conference would reflect on the messages concerns that I have tried to convey this morning I hope the Conference would deliberate on these issues and come up with practical solutions to the presentimpending challenges Global coordination and intensive efforts to ensure integrity of banknotes is the need of the hour and I hope that all stakeholders viz the Central Banks state policy makers and vendors who are involved in the process of production supply and distribution of banknotes would discuss these issues in a more purposeful manner Ultimately this is the prime objective of the Conference It is our collective responsibility to bring greater efficiency in the entire currency management function an essential commitment that all of us must make to the end users spread across regions and jurisdictions Thank you 1Text version of

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=544&fn=2753,Date Dilemmas in Central Bank Communication Some Reflections Based on Recent Experience,The Reserve Bank is the nations sole note issuing authority Along with the Government of India we are responsible for the design production and overall management of the nations currency with the goal of ensuring an adequate supply of clean and genuine notes First of all my thanks to Business Standard and to my good friends TN Ninan and Sanjaya Baru for inviting me to deliver this second Business Standard Annual lecture This is an honour to which I attach a lot of value Central Bank Communication 2 As a part of my job I accept several speaking commitments and often I struggle to determine the topic for my speech and the key message I should be delivering From that perspective deciding on a topic for this lecture has been relatively easy I have chosen to speak on Dilemmas in Central Bank Communication and that choice has been motivated by three reasons 3 First over two years into the job as Governor of the Reserve Bank I am still traversing a steep learning curve I have learnt many things and one of them is that communication of policy is as important as the content of policy and is oftentimes more challenging 4 The second motivation for my choice of the lecture topic comes from the experience of the recent crisis when central bankers around the world realized how communication is critical to the effectiveness of crisis management policy This bias towards openness actually reflects a remarkable shift in stance on the part of central bankers As Liaquat Ahamad says in his best selling book Lords of Finance central bankers had previously believed that in times of crisis it is prudent to obey the admonition of mothers across cultures to their children If you cant say anything nice dont say anything at all This follows from the recurring dilemma that central bankers face in times of panic If you make an honest public statement you end up feeding the frenzy On the other hand if you try to be reassuring you have to twist the truth In recent decades however central bankers have been increasingly persuaded that even in times of stress they are better off communicating rather than not communicating The recent crisis reinforced this growing faith in communication as central bankers realized much to their relief that keeping the public informed and updated actually reduced rather than exacerbated anxiety and panic 5 The final reason for my choosing this topic is quite straight forward This lecture is sponsored by a media house and what better platform than this to share with the public some of the dilemmas and challenges we face in our communication strategy Domain of Communication 6 Central bank communication has been the subject matter of much intellectual discourse but this has almost always been in the context of communication of monetary policy That is understandable because monetary policy is at the heart of central banking and also possibly because communication of monetary policy is arguably more challenging than communicating other policies In my lecture today though I will speak about communication in a broader context not just with reference to monetary policy but also encompassing other dimensions of the Reserve Banks mandate such as for example regulation and supervision currency management and external sector management Alan Greenspan the Doyen of Communication 7 It would be blasphemous to speak about central bank communication without first paying homage to that doyen of central bankers Alan Greenspan So let me get on with it 8 Greenspan is notoriously famous for several things including for transforming central bank communication to an art form Since Ive become a central banker he said in 1987 Ive learned to mumble with great incoherence If I seem unduly clear to you you must have misunderstood what I said 9 After nearly 15 years on the job in October 2001 Greenspan took a U turn saying that Openness is more than just useful in shaping better economic performance Openness is an obligation of a central bank in a free and democratic society Transparency of our activities is the means by which we make ourselves accountable to our fellow citizens to aid them in judging whether we are worthy of that task Indeed we owe it to Greenspan and perhaps his Delphic utterances for generating much learned commentary on why central bank communication is important Why is Central Bank Communication Important 10 Over the last two decades central banks have moved towards clearer communication and greater transparency This has been driven by several motivations 11 First and foremost central banks have realized that open and transparent communication enhances policy effectiveness by way of achieving expected outcomes This shift in central bank theology from deliberate obscurity to greater transparency actually reflects a shift in the theory of monetary policy Up until the early 1990s monetary policy was strongly influenced by Nobel Laureate Robert Lucas argument that monetary policy affected real variables like growth only if the policy changes were unanticipated This encouraged obscurity over openness and clarity However lost in the message was that monetary policy always affected nominal variables like inflation even if fully anticipated In the 1980s two economists also Nobel winners Finn Kydland and Ed Prescott argued that fully transparent rules rather than discretionary policy changes were more efficient and credible This was the beginning of the push towards rules over discretion and greater central bank transparency 12 The most eloquent illustration of this shift towards transparency is the change in the communication strategy of the US Fed Hard as it might be to imagine from todays perspective prior to 1994 the US Fed was not even announcing the target Fed Funds Rate the market was expected to infer the rate from the timing sequencing and magnitude of its open market operations In sharp contrast today the Fed not only announces the rate but also gives a clear indication of future policy trajectory Indeed it is standard practice for central banks these days to indicate the policy rates the rationale behind the policy action the expected outcomes and oftentimes to give forward guidance on future policy actions 13 While communicating policy after it is made is the standard mode of communication central banks are also increasingly taking to communication before policy action This again is a lesson of experience that the market does not like unexpected news and that surprises should be avoided unless surprise is in rare circumstances part of the strategy itself When the Fed announced last August that it would reinvest the proceeds of maturing securities purchased under the first phase of quantitative easing QE1 markets were unnerved In contrast the elaborate communication exercise that preceded the recent QE2 brought much clarity to the Fed action and delivered the expected announcement effect QE2 has of course come in for extensive criticism but that is certainly not owing to any shortfall in communication 14 We have had a similar experience at the Reserve Bank Both on the way up to the crisis and on the way down we had to make several offcycle policy adjustments There was wide agreement that these measures were expedient nevertheless they did not go down well with the market because of the surprise element This has prompted us to revise our communication strategy by introducing with effect from September 2010 more structured scheduled midquarter reviews While we have not surrendered our flexibility to take policy action as and when warranted more frequent scheduling of policy reviews reduces the need for offcycle action and thereby minimizes the surprise element 15 Sometimes communication instead of being a vehicle for policy can be the policy itself Drawing yet again from the US experience during the crisis the Fed realized that its repeated announcement of keeping rates low for an extended period led markets to reach a certain inference on what extended period could mean In this context some policy analysts argued that a step that the Fed could consider was to modify the language of the statement to communicate to investors that it anticipates keeping the target Federal Funds rate low for a longer period than was currently priced in the markets This it was believed would have eased financial conditions as was desired 16 Communication can be a potentially powerful tool for getting feedback when the implications and the impact of proposed policy are uncertain For example the Reserve Bank has thrown open the issue of whether we should deregulate the interest rate on savings accounts which incidentally is one of the very few interest rates that remains administered There are persuasive arguments both for and against deregulating this In the Reserve Bank we realized that this is like all big decisions a judgement call and that we needed the wisdom of the crowds in reaching a judgement Discerning people would no doubt have realized that eliciting views and feedback is now standard practice for most policy decisions of the Reserve Bank 17 Yet another factor that has motivated central banks into placing larger emphasis on communication is their hard earned autonomy in the years before the crisis Central banks have increasingly embraced more open communication to counter the criticism that an autonomous central bank comprising unelected decision makers was inconsistent with a democratic structure 18 Finally central bank communication is important for the institution to learn listen and understand This is a lesson that we have taken to heart in the Reserve Bank I am referring here not to the standard one way oral or written communication but to two way communication between the central bank and its stakeholders with the central bank remaining largely in a listening mode During our platinum jubilee last year we launched the outreach programme whereby all of us in the senior management together with our field office staff and accompanied by senior functionaries of commercial banks visited remote villages across the country This was an immensely rewarding learning experience in several ways Most of all we found that listening to people and understanding their concerns enriches our policy making in a very powerful way Because of its enormous value add we are continuing the outreach programme as a regular activity Communication Illustration of Dilemmas 19 I have so far told you with the help of some recent examples why central bank communication is growing in importance I have debated about how to go on from here One option is to list all that we have done in the Reserve Bank to improve communication but that may be a boring litany Another is to give a scholarly discourse on central bank communication but there are people around with greater expertise than I to do that I have therefore decided that I will give you ten illustrations of the communication dilemmas and challenges that we have faced in the Reserve Bank in the recent period i Monetary Policy To Pause or Not to Pause 20 As all of you know in calibrating the exit from the expansionary monetary stance of the crisis period the Reserve Bank has been struggling with the growthinflation dynamics over the last one year By the time of the second quarter review in early November 2010 we had already raised policy interest rates five times The central issue before this policy review was whether we should continue on the tightening spree or pause before resuming tightening later on We consulted experts and economists and found that opinion was divided among them One view was that we must pause for a bit in order for the rate hikes already affected to play out and then resume tightening The opposing view was that we should continue tightening to a point that would deliver RBIs inflation projection and pause only after that Inside the Reserve Bank the view was that within the policy trajectory it did not matter if we paused briefly as long as we remained committed to the eventual outcome The dilemma then boiled down to communicating to the market that our action should be interpreted only as a comma and not a full stop Whether or not we managed the dilemma effectively is of course for you to judge ii Monetary Policy Stance Forward Guidance 21 Central banks have learnt that giving forward guidance on the policy trajectory is an effective way of managing market expectations But they have also learnt that this is not a totally benign option The forward guidance is typically conditional on certain expected macroeconomic developments The dilemma then is how precisely is the conditionality to be communicated and how to ensure that the market does not ignore the conditionality and interpret the guidance as an irrevocable commitment In keeping with the best practice we in the Reserve Bank too have started giving some forward guidance And as expected we too have confronted the classic communication dilemma Let me illustrate In the Second Quarter Review of early November 2010 we had said Based purely on current growth and inflation trends the Reserve Bank believes that the likelihood of further rate actions in the immediate future is relatively low However in an uncertain world we need to be prepared to respond appropriately to shocks that may emanate from either the global or domestic environment 22 Many analysts commended us for the forward guidance but a few thought that we were imprecise on the conditionality as well as on the time horizon implied by immediate future I can only say that the element of ambiguity was deliberate because it was unavoidable iii Monetary Policy Stance Close to Normal or Closer to Normal 23 Let me give you another illustration of how we agonize over how every word might be interpreted In the midquarter review of September 2010 as part of the forward guidance we had said the Reserve Bank believes that the tightening that has been carried out over this period has taken the monetary situation close to normal 24 There were two communication dilemmas here The first was whether we should say close to or closer to In the end we determined that the forward guidance would be meaningful only if we had said close to thereby giving ourselves room for further action The second dilemma was about whether normal would be interpreted as neutral This dilemma arises in the context of the frequently asked question Have the policy rates become neutral The neutral policy rate as the economists here would know is the policy interest rate consistent with potential growth and low and stable inflation It is however not possible to precisely define the neutral rate for a rapidly growing and structurally transforming economy like that of India On the other hand normal rates can be broadly inferred from the crest and trough of the policy rates over the growthinflation cycle In the post policy dissemination we made an extra effort to communicate this distinction between normal and neutral rates iv Monetary Policy Stance Communicating Uncertainty 25 A frequent dilemma we face is about how much of the uncertainty surrounding a policy decision we should communicate Our policy decisions are based among other criteria on macroeconomic data all of which is in the public domain The media has more than enough expertise to interpret and analyze this data Nonetheless the market is eager to know the Reserve Banks interpretation of the data because in the ultimate analysis it is our interpretation that informs the policy decision 26 To give you an example the IIP index of industrial production data has been fluctuating in recent months bewildering analysts about the underlying trend and even raising doubts about the quality of the data itself The market was understandably anxious about how the RBI might read the data In order to let the market know that we do not know anything more than it does and to convey the extent of our uncertainty in our September 2010 midquarter review we said the high volatility of the IIP over the past two months raises some doubts about how effectively the index reflects the underlying momentum in the industrial sector v Disclosing Inflation Expectations Survey 27 The Reserve Bank conducts a quarterly inflation expectations survey based on a sample of 4000 respondents spread over 12 cities including the four metros We have been doing this since September 2005 and have gradually refined the survey methodology over time Although the survey was originally intended to be an internal exercise to improve our appreciation of the inflation situation by 2009 there was a growing view within the Reserve Bank that we should communicate the survey results to the public on the principle that as far as possible there should be no information asymmetry between the public and us We resolved that issue fairly quickly We got the data quality and data analysis peer reviewed by a high level technical committee and based on the committees endorsement decided on disclosure 28 The real communication dilemma was the one that followed whether we will be able to convey the arms length relationship between the Reserve Bank and the Reserve Bank Survey and make the broader public appreciate that the survey results are the opinion of the respondents and not of the Reserve Bank We made a serious effort to maintain that distinction Initial reports showed that some segments of the public remain confused but we are hoping that that confusion will resolve in due course Communication Dilemmas Outside Monetary Policy Arena 29 As I said earlier communication dilemmas arise not just in the domain of monetary policy but also with respect to other dimensions of the Reserve Banks work Let me give you some illustrations from those vi Guidelines for New Bank Licences 30 As you know there is a proposal to licence some new banks The last time the Reserve Bank had formulated guidelines for bank licencing was way back in 2001 the world has changed a lot since then We realized that the guidelines for bank licensing need to be revisited in the changed context The broad issues in new bank licensing are by now quite familiar the initial size of capital the period to be allowed for capital dilution conversion of NBFCs to banks or promotion of banks by NBFCs and the advisability of allowing corporates to start banks On several of these issues the world view has changed many heresies of the past have become orthodoxies today 31 We were eager to evaluate our bank licencing guidelines in the light of later experience and to get broadbased feedback from all stakeholders Accordingly we decided to put out a discussion paper listing the pros and cons of each of the decision criteria We were genuinely open minded and made deliberate effort to communicate our open mindedness Most media and a majority of the analysts had thought we came across quite well on that count But a small segment said that we had betrayed our biases causing some consternation within the Reserve Bank It is not clear whether we had fallen short in our communication effort or whether our interlocutors were superimposing their own prejudices in evaluating us Regardless there is a lesson here for us to improve our communication vii Basel III Getting the Message Across 32 As many of you know the G20 at its Seoul meeting in November 2010 endorsed the Basel III package for bank regulation and supervision At the heart of Basel III are efforts to fortify the banking system correct the incentive framework and ensure its long term stability We in India are in the process of evaluating the impact of Basel III on Indian banks and I have spoken about that at length elsewhere2 Basel III poses several challenges including communication challenges Let me illustrate two of the important ones 33 First central to Basel III is the idea that banks should build up capital and provisioning buffers during good times and draw these down during downturns so as to be able to continue lending while absorbing losses The underlying rationale is sound but somewhat counterintuitive Experience shows that markets demand that banks maintain higher capital and provisioning during a downturn to withstand higher risks If markets continue with such expectation banks would likely hoard capital and stop lending which will exacerbate the downturn The communication challenge therefore is to educate the market on the Basel III notion of buffers and their manner of use so that these safeguards function the way they are intended to 34 The second communication challenge under the proposed Basel III package comes from the comply or explain framework under which countries have the option to deviate from certain components of the package and explain why they have deviated The concern really is that the market known for its unfailing ruthlessness will penalize any deviation and the communication challenge for regulators is to persuade the markets to evaluate the countrys compliance based on the explanation viii Systemically Important Financial Institutions SIFIs 35 The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision BCBS and the Financial Stability Board FSB are currently engaged in devising a framework for regulating and supervising systemically important financial institutions SIFIs SIFIs as is well known were at the centre of the recent crisis Since they are too big to fail and too interconnected to fail they had to be rescued at a huge cost to the tax payers The international level work currently in progress is engaged in identifying ways to reduce the moral hazard of SIFIs defining the criteria for their identification and designing differential capital and liquidity surcharge for them 36 Under the arrangement presently under discussion SIFIs will be preidentified on the basis of some defined criteria and subjected to graded prudential surcharges and other safeguards These are intended to eliminate the moral hazard reduce their systemic risk potential and should it become inevitable allow them to fail in an orderly manner The intent is to preidentify SIFIs for the purpose of greater supervision but not to disclose the list as that would accentuate the moral hazard 37 The dilemma is how the market might actually respond to this deliberate nontransparency Will the market guess the list of SIFIs as indeed it will and interpret the intent behind the enhanced regulation as a way of preserving the too big to fail syndrome continue to give SIFIs competitive advantage in funding markets on such a flawed understanding and thereby encourage risky behaviour Or will the market appreciate that the true intent behind the preidentification and more stringent regulation and supervision of SIFIs is to reduce the probability of their failure and in the event of failure to make their resolution feasible and apportion the burden across all stakeholders without burdening the tax payers Limits to Transparency Some Practical Challenges 38 As many of you will appreciate there is a difference between appropriate openness and inappropriate openness Greater transparency is not always better communication and white noise often complicates understanding Also central banks may sometimes withhold information for strategic reasons Many of you will recall the intense debate that preceded the release of the results of bank stress testing in the US There was an apprehension that banks that come out as stressed will be pushed into a vicious circle of further stress as a result of the disclosure thereby losing the wriggle room to turn around Let me give you two examples from our own experience to illustrate the communication challenges of this type ix Security Features of Currency Notes 39 We face a classic communication dilemma in disclosing the security features of our currency notes We are deeply conscious that to check counterfeiting we need to constantly enhance the security features of the currency That is necessary but not sufficient The sufficiency condition will be met when people become aware of the security features so that they can tell a forged note from a genuine one The dilemma is that when we launch an awareness drive we are providing information also to counterfeiters We resolve this issue by making the replication of security features technically complex and prohibitively expensive and also by incorporating some additional security features that can be detected only by sophisticated gadgets and equipment An added challenge in this regard is that our awareness campaign has to educate the public without unduly alarming them This has prompted us to opt for a soft campaign rather than a hardhitting one it might take longer to create the necessary impact but it will be more lasting x Disclosing the Composition of Foreign Exchange Reserves 40 Let me give you another illustration of the limits to transparency The Reserve Bank puts out the data on foreign exchange reserves every week with a lag of one week We also publish a half yearly report on the management of foreign exchange reserves indicating several details including the objectives of the reserve management strategy the adequacy of the reserves risk management practices etc However we do not disclose the currency composition of our reserves and we have been criticized for our lack of communication in this regard The reason we do not disclose the currency composition is because as the forex reserves manager we are like any other commercial entity in the market The information is market sensitive and disclosure could potentially impact our commercial interests adversely Disclosure also has wider implications for our international relations Furthermore market efficiency is in no way affected by our nondisclosure Indeed nondisclosure is the norm around the world a majority of the countries particularly the large reserve holders do not disclose the composition of their foreign exchange reserves 41 We have however progressively moved towards greater disclosure in line with international best practices The Reserve Bank is among 68 central banks from around the world to have adopted the Special Data Dissemination Standards SDDS template for publication of detailed data on foreign exchange reserves including some information on currency composition investment pattern and forward positions These data are put out on a monthly basis on RBIs website The Reserve Bank is also one of the very few central banks which publish market intervention numbers in its monthly Bulletin with a lag of two months Role and Responsibility of the Media 42 A lecture on communication dilemmas of central banks would be incomplete without a comment on the role and responsibilities of the media So let me address that issue briefly 43 First of all I want to compliment the Indian media both print and electronic for the useful intermediation role they play between policy makers and stakeholders The media disseminates interprets and explains the news to the public and in the reverse direction conveys stakeholder concerns perceptions and opinions to the policy makers In the Reserve Bank we enjoy a professional and mutually beneficial relationship with the media They add value by informing and educating the stakeholders on RBI policies and actions and keep us on our toes through their feedback and critique I am often impressed by the depth of media analysis and their insightful opinion pieces and leaders I will also let you in on a secret My staff tutor me painstakingly before scheduled media interactions but the depth of my understanding is oftentimes put to test by the media interlocutors who spring questions that we had not thought of 44 Even as the media has been an effective intermediary between the Reserve Bank and its stakeholders there are ways in which it can become even more effective Let me make a few suggestions in this regard 45 Sometimes I find that the competition among the media militates against the quality of analysis The media disseminates economic and financial news indeed any news at three levels The first level is news as news and I can appreciate the race to be the first at this level The second level is analysis and interpretation and the third level is opinion It is at these latter two levels that competition to be the first with it compromises quality The media will probably be more effective and value adding if it allows time for digesting the news and thinks through before analysis and interpretation and does some research before coming out with opinion I am no expert in journalism but as a consumer of journalism I think my interests will be better served by more indepth analysis and critique rather than of the get up and go variety of opinion dissemination 46 Second media reporting is sometimes inaccurate and the risk of misinformation in such cases is high If Dr Reddy Labs in Hyderabad projects 9 per cent earnings growth and if that is reported under a large headline of Dr Reddy projects 9 per cent growth even the intelligent reader can be forgiven for believing it to be Dr YV Reddy the then RBI Governor projecting 9 per cent GDP growth Surely more stringent quality control will make the media a more useful and effective news intermediator 47 Third as much as I can appreciate the unwavering focus of the media on news that sells the media has a responsibility also for broadbasing its reporting You often report what policy makers say on the sidelines of an event in broad headlines and completely ignore the event itself This tendency I believe is unfair to the event organizers as well as to your broader audience who should know of the event 48 I am also intrigued by how the media picks up a tiny segment of a speech and reports only that and that too often out of context For example a few months ago I spoke at a bankers conference on the implications of Basel III for the Indian banking system and in passing I had made a comment about how the salary structure of public sector banks needs to be revisited to attract and retain talent I was puzzled by how this bit alone got extensively reported and commented upon Admittedly the reporting was constructive but I still feel that the larger issues of Basel III too should have made it to news and comment 49 Finally a brief but important comment on the role of the media during the recent crisis It has played an effective and largely useful role in disseminating news and views but also on occasion fuelled the frenzy Some of the panic during the crisis could have been avoided and at any rate contained if the media opted for restraint instead of sensationalism 50 I have critiqued the media not so much to find fault but to share my perceptions I do want to reiterate that the media plays a constructive and value adding role and they are a critical instrumentality for the RBI as an institution and for me as the Governor in delivering on our mandate Conclusion 51 Let me now conclude In matters of communication central banks have certainly come a long long way from their haughty indifference of the past to cautious eagerness of the present Consider this In the 1930s in response to some criticism of the Bank of England by Lord Keynes Sir Ernst Harvey the Deputy Governor deposed before the Macmillan Committee As regards criticism we at the Bank of England do not admit there is a need for defence to defend ourselves is somewhat akin to a lady starting to defend her virtue Fast forward to today Lady of virtue or no virtue mystique and secrecy are no longer the bywords of central banks On the other hand central banks are now wise to the fact that in this age of globalization they can leverage on communication to enhance their effectiveness 52 Increasingly central bank communication is not just a matter of openness and transparency but also of education guidance persuasion and dialogue and of listening and learning My interest in sharing with you the dilemmas and challenges we face in our communication has been to convey to you how we carefully weigh the various policy options and how once we have made a policy choice deliberate on what to say and how to say it The Reserve Bank takes its communication role seriously It is our continuing endeavour to communicate in a clear manner so as to minimize scope for misinterpretation in an effective manner so that the diverse target groups get the relevant information and message in an honest manner such that we explain the known knowns and indicate the known unknowns and in a consistent manner such that people can link our policies and action to past trends and future projections 53 No doubt in the Reserve Bank we still have a way to go to reach the best practice in communication All I can say is we will make every effort to get there Reserve Bank of India Some Recent Initiatives Towards Enhancing Communication Substantive

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=487&fn=2753,Date Some Issues in Currency Management,The Reserve Bank is the nations sole note issuing authority Along with the Government of India we are responsible for the design production and overall management of the nations currency with the goal of ensuring an adequate supply of clean and genuine notes It is my pleasure and privilege to participate in this function for laying the foundation stone for the Bank Note Paper Mill A special and hearty welcome to the Honble Finance Minister Shri Pranab Mukherjee but for whose active support the launch of this vital and prestigious project would not have been possible 2 I want to use this opportunity to speak on this occasion to highlight the significance of paper currency touch on the history of production of currency notes in India and then address certain issues in currency management Importantly I would also like to outline the importance of this paper mill that we are launching today 3 Currency notes in circulation have increased significantly since the time RBI was established 75 years ago The value of notes in circulation in the country has increased from about Rs172 crore in 1935 to more than Rs700000 crore in 2009 In terms of volume the notes in circulation have increased from 124 million pieces in 1935 to more than 51 billion pieces in 2009 In fact after China India is the largest producer and consumer of currency notes 4 As the economy grows people need more currency and other payment instruments to settle their transactions Notwithstanding several innovations in the field of payment and settlement common people in our country as indeed in many other developing countries still use paper currency for their routine financial transactions The ratio of currency with the public to GDP which was 12 per cent in 1951 is currently around 13 per cent demonstrating that currency still remains an important mode of payment in the country It is the Reserve Banks responsibility as the sole issuer of notes to make available good and clean notes in adequate quantity to the public History and Evolution of Production of Notes in India 5 Currencybank notes are among the most massproduced commodities in the world The genesis of paper money is generally attributed to the token money that evolved around the 10th century in China In India the enthusiastic experiment by Muhammed Bin Tughlaq in the 14th century to issue token money and replace silver taka with copper though a genuine monetary experiment ended in disaster 6 Use of paper money started in the West in the 17th century However paper currency did not catch on in India because of the political turmoil following the collapse of Mughal Empire in the 17th century Early currency in the form of I owe you promissory notes issued by banks or royal courts made appearance in India only in late 18th century Among the early issuer of bank notes in India were Bank of Hindostan 17701832 the General Bank of Bengal and Behar 177375 the Bengal Bank 178491 the Commercial Bank etc Use of bank notes however became widespread only after the semigovernment Presidency Banks started issuing notes notably the Bank of Bengal which was established in 1806 These banks were established under a Government Charter and were required to observe some prudential norms like cash reserve maximum exposure limit limit for note issue etc 7 Use of official Government of India paper currency commenced in 1861 with the enactment of the Paper Currency Act The management of currency across the Indian subcontinent was evidently a huge task requiring creation of currency circles The Presidency banks were made agents for issue and redemption In 1913 the Office of Controller of Currency was established replacing the Currency Department in the Government In 1935 Reserve Bank of India was created which took over the function of note issue from the Controller of Currency 8 Indian Currency notes were printed in England till late 1920s Recognising that production of currency notes is a strategically important activity the then Government of India set up a currency printing press at Nashik in Maharashtra in 1928 This was followed by the setting up of another press at Dewas in Madhya Pradesh nearly fifty years later in 1975 Meanwhile in 1967 a security paper mill with a capacity of 1500 metric tonnes per year was established at Hoshangabad in MP By the late 1980s the demand for currency notes exceeded the capacity of the two Government note presses To meet the demandsupply gap at the instance of Government of India the Reserve Bank established in 1996 two currency presses this one here in Mysore and the other at Salboni in West Bengal These were set up through a wholly owned subsidiary of RBI viz the Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Pvt Ltd BRBNMPL By 1999 the BRBNMPLs two new presses started working to their full capacity making the country self reliant once again in currency note printing Clean Note Policy and Its Implementation 9 In 1999 after sufficient printing capacity has been firmly established the Reserve Bank adopted the Clean Note Policy for circulation of fairly good quality banknotes and withdrawal of unfitsoiled banknotes from circulation and their destruction In pursuit of this clean note policy RBI did several things We mechanized the process of note sortingprocessing and destruction of unfit notes starting in 200001 Recognizing that the practice of stapling of notes was resulting in disfiguration of notes impeding machine processing and reducing their longevity RBI issued a directive to banks under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act to stop stapling of currency notes and instead secure them with paper bands RBI advised banks to sort notes into reissuable and non issuable categories and reissue only clean notes to the public Finally RBI launched an awareness campaign exhorting public to desist from writing on the watermark window of the notes or folding or stapling the notes 10 As part of the mechanization and systems improvement drive we have installed as many as 54 high speed currency verification and processing machines and 27 shredding and briquetting machines in 19 offices across the country We have advised bank branches with currency chests to equip all their chests with Note Sorting Machines and to ensure that only clean notes are reissued to the public over the counter and through ATMs Currently there are over 4300 currency chests well equipped with Note Sorting Machines We also did a systems overhaul to improve productivity reinforce safeguards and minimize errors 11 The above efforts resulted in credible improvements In the two year period between September 2007 and September 2009 the accumulation of soiled notes at currency chests and issue offices has been brought down from 190 days of processing capacity to 68 days The disposal of soiled notes increased from 73 billion pieces to 119 billion pieces Fresh notes issued to currency chests and the public increased from 107 billion pieces in 200607 to 138 billion pieces in 200809 Fake CurrencyCounterfeit Notes 12 Counterfeiting of money is almost as old as printing of currency At some period in history it was considered treasonous enough to warrant punishment by death It was in 1650 AD that paper money was developed and counterfeiting flourished especially within America where counterfeit money was more common than genuine money Counterfeiters had become so skilled that when the first federal coins were issued by the US Government in the 1780s they had the dies cut by an excounterfeiter However it was the advent of colour copiers and other electronic devices in late twentieth century that made counterfeiting easier Around the world governments are locked in a fierce race with counterfeiters to keep that one crucial step ahead in terms of technology and security features Governments are also tightening measures to check counterfeiting apprehend counterfeiters and impose deterrent and harsher punishments 13 Data available in the public domain suggests that the incidence of counterfeiting varies across different countries While in Australia counterfeit notes detected were around seven pieces per million notes in circulation 200809 in Canada it was 76 2008 In New Zealand the number was a low of 071 counterfeits per million notes in circulation 200809 whereas in Switzerland it was ten As for the euro there was roughly about one counterfeit per 14600 bank notes in circulation 2008 At home here in India fake notes reported as detected by banks and fake notes found in remittances received by RBI during 200809 amounted to eight per one million notes in circulation The data however does not include the counterfeits that are seized by police The above data shows that by an international metric the incidence of counterfeit notes in India is not alarming Nevertheless counterfeiting per se is a matter of serious concern for the Government and the Reserve Bank 14 While on the subject of estimate of fake notes I want to make a clarification Last year some newspapers had erroneously quoted a figure from the Nayak Committee Report for estimates of forged currency notes in circulation The Nayak Committee which was set up in 1988 to go into the dynamics of currency management did not make any estimate of fake currency What it estimated was the projected value of notes in circulation in the year 2000 which has Rs 169000 crore The media incorrectly reported this as the number of fake notes in circulation 15 The Reserve Banks role in addressing the problem of counterfeiting lies in improving the security features of the currency notes putting in place a system where all fake notes making entry into the banking channel are promptly detected and raising public awareness levels For the sake of completeness let me list the measures initiated by Reserve Bank for addressing the menace of counterfeiting 16 RBIs efforts at checking counterfeiting will be effective only if there are equally effective efforts by banks Banks should ensure that counterfeit notes are promptly detected once they enter the banking system and that there is prompt and accurate reporting They should ensure that only clean and genuine notes are issued through their ATMs and over the counters As currency notes are an integral part of our daily life we as users should understand the various security features of the notes These features are prominent and can be easily identified Enhanced public awareness will by far be the most effective deterrent to counterfeiting Polymer notes 17 Cost and longevity are important issues in currency management After due consideration and in consultation with the Government the Reserve Bank has decided to introduce one billion pieces of Rs 10 banknotes on polymer substrate on a field trial basis in a limited launch in five cities While cleanliness and durability are seen as the major advantages of polymer the carbon footprint associated with production use and disposal of polymer notes is an important issue Available information indicates that polymer banknotes and the waste from production can be granulated and recycled into useful plastic products such as compost bins plumbing fittings and other household and industrial products Considering the relatively longer life of polymer notes and their amenability to recycling the carbon footprint of polymer notes visvis paper banknotes is likely to be on the plus side Regardless this is one of the issues that we will study during the pilot phase and will embark on polymer notes on a long term basis only if the costbenefit calculus is decidedly positive in all dimensions Why We Need This Paper Mill 18 It should be a matter of pride for all of us that the entire requirement of the countrys currency needs this years estimate is of 17 billion pieces is printed within the country However for the main raw material required for this the banknote paper we are heavily dependent on imports The existing facility at Hoshangabad meets just 5 per cent of our requirement We need to significantly increase our selfsufficiency in this regard for a number of operational economic and strategic reasons Producing our own paper is decidedly cheaper and importantly a check against counterfeiting The banknote paper market is a strong oligarchy Indias demand for banknote paper 18000 MT per year is huge in international terms and on the supply side there are just 34 large producers This situation exposes us to vulnerabilities of a suppliers market in terms of price quantity and timelines something that we should avoid or at any rate minimize 19 It would be pertinent to note that major countries viz USA Japan China Brazil Russia and countries in the euro area and even smaller countries like South Korea Indonesia Iran and Pakistan make their own bank note paper 20 It was in this background that the Government and the Reserve Bank of India decided to set up a banknote paper mill with an annual production capacity of 12000 MT as a backward linkage in the process of note printing The proposed paper mill is a joint venture between the Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Private Ltd BRBNMPL and the Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Ltd SPMCIL the two agencies which are collectively responsible for printing of all currency notes in the country 21 This plant in Mysore for which the Finance Minister is laying the foundation stone today will be a state of the art production unit that will showcase to the world Indias capacity to produce banknote paper conforming to the best international quality and security standards 22 I wish the project and the people behind its implementation all success Once again a very warm welcome all of you to this foundation stone laying function
https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=488&fn=2753,Date Speech of Finance Minister Foundation Laying Ceremony for Security Paper Mill at Mysore Karnataka on March 22 2010,The Reserve Bank is the nations sole note issuing authority Along with the Government of India we are responsible for the design production and overall management of the nations currency with the goal of ensuring an adequate supply of clean and genuine notes Dr Subbarao Governor RBI Mrs Thorat Deputy Governor RBI Members of the Board of Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Pvt Ltd BRBNMPL and the Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Ltd SPMCIL Friends ladies and gentlemen 2 It gives me immense pleasure to be here today in this historic city of Mysore on the occasion of laying the foundation stone for the project for establishing a stateofthe art currency notepaper production facility I congratulate Ministry of Finance and the RBI for having conceptualized the architecture of this project and put the implementation thereof on a fast track in a relatively short period of time 3 Currency distribution is a key sovereign function and among the primary functions of a central bank It is also the most visible of its functions as it touches directly and immediately the common person Hence simply put the currency notes continue to occupy a key position in financial transactions being carried out in the economy 4 As per Section 25 of the RBI Act 1934 the design form and material of bank notes are to be approved by the Central Government on the basis of advice tendered by the RBI Section 22 of the Act gives RBI the sole right to issue bank notes in India The preamble of the Act enjoins the RBI to regulate the issue of bank notes and operate the currency system of the country The wholly owned enterprises of the Central Government and RBI namely SPMCIL and BRBNMPL are responsible for meeting the demand of Indian Currency Notes Thus the Central Government and RBI have coequal responsibility for administration of currency related matters This production unit which has been contemplated as a joint venture entity between SPMCIL and BRBNMPL in equal proportion reflects the need to maintain and further strengthen the cooperative endeavour in this arena between the Government and RBI 5 Managing currency is a strategic function One of the main challenges is to be vigilant against the menace of counterfeit currency which if unchecked has severe consequences Circulation of fake notes in large numbers can lead to erosion of the value of legally earned wealth of citizens fuel inflation through oversupply of money and adversely affect the security of the country by surreptitious funding of illegal and unlawful activities India is especially vulnerable in this regard since much of the counterfeiting takes place as State sponsored activity by some countries and forces inimical to our interests While the magnitude of counterfeit currency in circulation has shown an increasing trend in recent years the magnitude of the problem is still within manageable proportion and the total estimated fake currency is a miniscule proportion of the money supply However the growing threat casts a responsibility upon us to ensure that our currency has high integrity is not prone to duplication and its distinctive features remain inviolate 6 For a vast and growing country like India indigenisation of various inputs for manufacturing currency notes namely security features paper and ink is cardinal to ensuring their integrity However resilient the processes may be doubts will always persist so long as we have to depend on foreign suppliers for meeting the requirements of ingredients that go into the making of bank notes India has posted several achievements in science and technology not just in the recent times but right from the inception of human civilization Therefore it is not beyond our capacity to aim for producing all the building blocks that go into production of currency notes 7 While we are wholly self reliant in the printing of currency notes we are largely dependent on imports for meeting the paper requirements Presently the annual requirement of paper for printing of Banknotes is around 18000 tonnes for printing of around 1516 billion pieces of notes with 95 of this being imported from foreign suppliers This requirement is expected to increase further which implies that in the absence of adequate domestic manufacturing capacity our dependence on imports will increase Besides on account of increase in demand of banknote paper globally without corresponding increase in the production capacity of paper the country may soon face a situation of shrinking supplies and concomitant higher prices 8 I am given to understand that this manufacturing facility at Mysore with a production capacity of 6000 tonnes per annum will be the first production line of the Joint Venture I am also told that the capacity will be increased to 12000 tonnes in the second phase These capacities will significantly redress the demand supply gap for currency paper in India and herald the start of the process which will eventually make India completely self reliant in all the security inputs required for manufacture of currency notes Indigenisation of banknote paper manufacturing will provide the benefits of backward integration in the form of assured smooth and timely supplies cost savings employment generation and an effective deterrent to counterfeiting Hence this project is of great strategic significance and we must remain resolutely committed to its success 9 The effort at indigenization should be carried to its logical end and subsume security features and ink as well I have been told that modest capacity exists within SPMCIL for manufacturing of security intaglio ink This capacity should be augmented and selfsufficiency in ink production needs to be targeted 10 The security features being used in bank notes are technologically advanced and developed products a result of large investments over long periods of time in research and development RD These products are procured from specialist suppliers through customized exclusivity agreements which protect the interests of the procuring country At present our capacities in this area are minimal However looking forward with the objective of complete indigenisation it is imperative to create a state of the art R D institution This institution shall on a continual basis keep pace with the innovations happening in this field and incubate capacities either in the existing institutions of higher research and learning or through Greenfield ventures in this significant area 11 I have been informed that significant potential for development of indigenous technologies exists in other related areas as well such as plated coins machinery and related software 12 Looking to the importance of ensuring self sufficiency in all aspects of security products I have constituted a high level review committee one of the terms of reference of which is to suggest a roadmap for progressive indigenization of various inputs including high end machinery and security features I am keenly awaiting the recommendations of this committee after which I plan to develop a roadmap for indigenization in consultation with the RBI which will enable us to meet the requirements of security inputs ensure integrity of our currency and effectively thwart menace of counterfeiting 13 I understand that a detailed timeline has been formulated for implementing this project It would be important to adhere to the milestones and I look forward to the successful and timely completion of the project I urge the Ministry of Finance and the RBI to monitor implementation of this important endeavour at periodic intervals to ensure that the project is completed in time bound manner I may also be kept informed in case of any issues that require intervention at my level 14 I once again congratulate all of you on this occasion and hope that this landmark Project will achieve its goals and serve the nations best interests

printing of notes in the denominations of 2 and 5 has been discontinued and these denominations have been coinised as the cost of printing and servicing these banknotes was not commensurate with their life However such banknotes issued earlier can still be found in circulation and these banknotes continue to be legal tender 1 notes are issued by the Government of India from time to time and such notes including those issued in the past also continue to be legal tender for transactions 3 Can banknotes be issued only in these denominations Not necessarily In terms of Section 24 of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 bank notes shall be of the denominational values of two rupees five rupees ten rupees twenty rupees fifty rupees one hundred rupees five hundred rupees one thousand rupees five

printed in a year depends on various factors such as i the expected increase in Notes in Circulation NIC to meet the growing needs of the public and ii the need for replacing soiledmutilated notes so as to ensure that only good quality notes are in circulation The expected increase in NIC is estimated using statistical models which consider macroeconomic factors such as expected growth in GDP inflation interest rates growth in noncash modes of payment etc The replacement requirement depends on the volume of notes already in circulation and the average life of banknotes The Reserve Bank estimates the volume and value of notes to be printed in a year based on the above factors as well as feedback received from its own Regional Offices and banks regarding expected demand for cash and finalises the same in consultation with the Government of India and the printing presses 12 Are the banknotes issued by RBI backed by any assets such as gold All banknotes issued by RBI are backed by

Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies issued as part of the Monetary Policy statement dated December 4 2020 wherein it was stated that with a view to strengthen and improve the efficacy of the grievance redress mechanism of banks and to provide better customer service it has been decided to put in place a comprehensive framework comprising certain measures 2 Reserve Bank of India has taken various initiatives over the years for improving customer service and grievance redress mechanism in banks Detailed guidelines on customer service were issued to banks encompassing various aspects of operations that impact customers The Banking Ombudsman Scheme was introduced in 1995 to serve as an alternate grievance redress mechanism for customer complaints against banks In 2019 Reserve Bank also introduced the Complaint Management System CMS a fully automated processflow based platform available 24x7 for customers to lodge their complaints with the Banking Ombudsman BO 3 As part of the disclosure initiative banks were advised to disclose in their annual reports summary information regarding the complaints handled by them and certain disclosures were also being made in the Annual Report of the Ombudsman Schemes published by the Reserve Bank To further strengthen grievance redress mechanisms banks were mandated to appoint an Internal Ombudsman IO to function as an independent and objective authority at the apex of their grievance redress mechanism 4 Effective grievance redress should be an integral part of the business strategy of the banks It is however evident from the increasing number of complaints received in the Offices of Banking Ombudsman OBOs that greater attention by banks to this area is warranted More focused attention to customer service and grievance redress will ensure satisfactory customer outcomes and greater customer confidence 5 In view of the above and to further strengthen the customer grievance redress mechanism in banks it has been decided to put in place a comprehensive framework comprising of interalia enhanced disclosures by banks on customer complaints recovery of cost of redress from banks for the maintainable complaints received against them in OBOs in excess of the peer group average and undertaking intensive review of the grievance redress mechanism and supervisory action against banks that fail to improve their redress mechanism in a time bound manner Details of the framework are provided in the Annex 6 The framework will come into effect from the date of the circular Yours faithfully Ranjana SahajwalaChief General Manager Annex Strengthening of Grievance Redress Mechanism in Banks The framework for strengthening grievance redress mechanism in banks will have the following major components I Enhanced disclosures on complaints 2 Disclosures serve as an important tool for market discipline as well as for consumer awareness and protection Appropriate disclosures relating to the number and nature of customer complaints and their redress facilitate customers and interested market participants to better differentiate among banks to take an informed decision in availing their products and services To ensure provision of relevant and important information in this regard to bank customers and other stakeholders the current set of disclosures made by the banks are being enhanced as indicated below Disclosures by banks 3 Disclosures currently made by banks regarding customer complaints and grievance redress in their annual report are made in terms of Para 164 of the Master Circular on Customer Service in Banks dated July 01 20151 The disclosures are summary in nature and comprise the following Current disclosures made by banks on complaints and grievance redress 4 It has now been decided that the above disclosures will be replaced by the following set of granular disclosures to be made by banks in their annual reports These disclosures are intended to provide to the customers of banks and members of public greater insight into the volume and nature of complaints received by the banks from their customers and the complaints received by banks from the OBOs as also the quality and turnaround time of redress Enhanced disclosures to be made by banks on complaints and grievance redress Particulars Previous year Current year II Recovery of cost of redress of complaints from banks 5 At present redress of complaints under BO Scheme 2006 BOS is costfree for banks as well as their customers Given that the bankercustomer relationship is the primary relationship the main responsibility of customer grievance redress lies with banks With a view to ensure that banks discharge this responsibility effectively the cost of redress of complaints will be recovered from those banks against whom the maintainable complaints2 in the OBOs exceed their peer group average as detailed in para 7 below However grievance redress under BOS for customers will continue to remain costfree 6 To operationalize the costrecovery framework for banks peer groups based on the asset size of banks as on March 31 of the previous year will be identified and peer group averages of maintainable complaints received in OBOs would be computed on the following three parameters average number of maintainable complaints per branch average number of maintainable complaints per 1000 accounts total of deposit and credit accounts held by the bank and average number of maintainable digital complaints per 1000 digital transactions3 executed through the bank by its customers 7 The cost of redressing complaints in excess of the peer group average will be recovered from the banks as follows excess in any one parameter 30 of the cost of redressing a complaint in the OBO for the number of complaints in excess of the peer group average excess in any two parameters 60 of the cost of redressing a complaint for the number of complaints exceeding the peer group average in the parameter with the higher excess excess in all the three parameters 100 of the cost of redressing a complaint for the number of complaints exceeding the peer group average in the parameter with the highest excess 8 The cost of redress to be recovered in this respect will be the average cost of handling a complaint at the OBOs during the year III Intensive Review of Grievance Redress Mechanism 9 Reserve Bank will undertake as a part of its supervisory mechanism annual assessments of customer service and grievance redress in banks based on the data and information available through the Complaint Management System and other sources and interactions Banks identified as having persisting issues in grievance redress will be subjected to an intensive review of their grievance redress mechanism to better identify the underlying systemic issues and initiate corrective measures The intensive review shall include but will not be limited to the following areas Adequacy of the customer service and customer grievance redress related policies Functioning of the Customer Service Committee of the Board Level of involvement of the Top Management in customer service and customer grievance related issues Effectiveness of the grievance redress mechanism of banks 10 Based on the review a remedial action plan will be formulated and formally communicated to the banks for implementation

banking structure and the rural poor for mutual benefit Studies conducted by NABARD in a few states to assess the impact of the linkage project have brought out encouraging and positive features like increase in loan volume of the SHGs definite shift in the loaning pattern of the members from nonincome generating activities to production activities nearly 100 per cent recovery performance significant reduction in the transaction costs for both the banks and the borrowers etc besides leading to a gradual increase in the income level of the SHG members Another significant feature observed in the linkage project is that about 85 per cent of the groups linked with banks were formed exclusively by women 2 Recognizing the importance of SHG Bank linkage banks have been advised to meet the entire credit requirements of SHG members as envisaged in Paragraph 93 of the Union Budget announcement for the year 200809 made by the Honorable Finance Minister wherein it was stated as

the entire credit requirements of SHG members namely a income generation activities b social needs like housing education marriage etc and c debt swapping Linking of SHGs with banks has thus been emphasized in the Monetary Policy Statements of Reserve Bank of India and Union Budget announcements from time to time and various guidelines have been issued to banks in this regard 3 Banks should provide adequate incentives to their branches in financing the Self Help Groups SHGs and establish linkages with them making the procedures simple and easy The group dynamics of working of the SHGs

sanctioned savings linked loans by banks varying from a saving to loan ratio of 11 to 14 However in case of matured SHGs loans may be given beyond the limit of four times the savings as per the discretion of the bank c A simple system requiring minimum procedures and documentation is a precondition for augmenting flow of credit to SHGs Banks should strive to remove all operational irritants and make arrangements to expeditiously sanction and disburse credit by delegating adequate sanctioning powers to branch managers The loan application forms procedures and documents should be made

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_PressRelease.aspx?prid=51526&fn=2754,Date Governors Statement May 5 2021,This role encapsulates the essence of renewed national focus on Financial Inclusion promoting financial education and literacy and making credit available to productive sectors of the economy including the rural and MSME sector As the financial year 202021 the year of the pandemic was drawing to a close the Indian economy was advantageously poised relative to peers India was at the foothills of a strong recovery having regained positive growth but more importantly having flattened the infections curve In a few weeks since then the situation has altered drastically Today India is fighting a ferocious rise in infections and mortalities New mutant strains have emerged causing severe strains on healthcare and medical facilities vaccine supplies and frontline health personnel The fresh crisis is still unfolding India has mounted a valiant defence domestically and globally to ramp up vaccines and medical support and save lives 2 Simultaneously shoring up livelihoods and restoring normalcy in access to workplaces education and incomes becomes an imperative As in the recent past the Reserve Bank of India RBI will continue to monitor the emerging situation and deploy all resources and instruments at its command in the service of the nation especially for our citizens business entities and institutions beleaguered by the second wave The devastating speed with which the virus affects different regions of the country has to be matched by swiftfooted and wideranging actions that are calibrated sequenced and welltimed so as reach out to various sections of society and business right down to the smallest and the most vulnerable While doing so our admiration and gratitude goes out to the brave citizens of our nation to our doctors healthcare and medical staff police and law enforcement agencies and to other authorities who battle the second surge selflessly and tirelessly and have been at the frontline for more than a year Their services to our nation are needed now more than ever The quarantine facilities of the RBI continue to operate with more than 250 RBI personnel and service providers away from their homes to ensure continuity of various segments of financial markets and RBI operations 3 Since the pandemic began I have on several occasions expressed my genuine faith in Indias resilience and capacity to overcome all odds To quote Mahatma Gandhi My faith is brightest in the midst of impenetrable darkness1 Over a year now we have struggled to free ourselves from the pandemics deadly grip Between midSeptember and February as a country we did manage to lower infections at a time when the rest of the world was reeling under malevolent surges of the virus This time around we have to marshal our resources and fight it again with renewed vigour ignited by the determination to overcome and to return to normalcy and sound health Assessment of the Current Economic Situation 4 Before I set out the measures that the RBI is proposing to undertake as the first part of a calibrated and comprehensive strategy against the pandemic let me reflect on the macroeconomic and financial conditions that prevail so that the context in which todays measures are being taken can be appreciated 5 The global economy is exhibiting incipient signs of recovery as countries renew their tryst with growth supported by monetary and fiscal stimulus Still activity remains uneven across countries and sectors The outlook is highly uncertain and clouded with downside risks In April 2021 the International Monetary Fund IMF revised up its global growth projection for 2021 to 60 per cent from 55 per cent projected in January 2021 on the assumption that vaccines would be available in advanced economies AEs and some emerging market economies EMEs by the summer of 2021 and in most other countries by the second half of 2022 World merchandise trade maintained its recent uptrend growing by 54 per cent in February 2021 on a yearonyear yoy basis Consumer price index CPI inflation remains benign for major AEs in a few EMEs however it persists above targets on account of firming global food and commodity prices Global financial markets regained buoyancy in April on vaccine optimism after bouts of volatility in FebruaryMarch followed by corrections 6 Moving to domestic developments aggregate supply conditions are underpinned by the resilience of the agricultural sector The record foodgrains production and buffer stocks in 202021 provide food security and support to other sectors of the economy in the form of rural demand employment and agricultural inputs and supplies including for exports The forecast of a normal monsoon by the India Meteorological Department IMD is expected to sustain rural demand and overall output in 202122 while also having a soothing impact on inflation pressures 7 Aggregate demand conditions particularly in contactintensive services are likely to see a temporary dip depending on how the COVID situation unfolds With restrictions and containment measures being localised and targeted businesses and households are learning to adapt Consequently the dent to aggregate demand is expected to be moderate in comparison to a year ago Reports suggest that the disruption in manufacturing units so far is minimal Consumption demand is holding up with sales of consumer goods rising in double digits in JanuaryMarch 2021 and average daily electricity generation up by 400 per cent yearonyear in April Rail freight has registered growth of over 76 per cent yearonyear in April Toll collections in April suggest that mobility has declined but quite unlike the abrupt halt in mobility during April last year Registration of automobiles in April 2021 has shown moderation compared to March The tractor segment continues its robust pace The Purchasing managers index PMI for manufacturing continued in expansion mode at 555 in April 2021 compared to 554 in the preceding month Overall the high frequency indicators are emitting mixed signals The RBI will closely and continuously monitor all incoming data to assess on a real time basis the impact of the second wave on macroeconomic and financial conditions 8 CPI inflation edged up to 55 per cent in March 2021 from 50 per cent a month ago on the back of a pickup in food as well as fuel inflation while core inflation remained elevated Highfrequency food prices data for April 2021 from the Department of Consumer Affairs DCA suggests further softening of prices of cereals and key vegetables while price pressures in pulses and edible oils remain Prices of petrol and diesel registered some moderation in April Manufacturing and services PMIs along with rising WPI inflation show a persistence of input price pressure The May 12 release of the National Statistics Office will throw more light on inflation developments in April Going forward a normal southwest monsoon as forecast by the IMD should help to contain food price pressures especially in cereals and pulses The buildup in input price pressures across sectors driven in part by elevated global commodity prices remains a concern The inflation trajectory over the rest of the year will be shaped by the COVID19 infections and the impact of localised containment measures on supply chains and logistics 9 In the external sector Indias merchandise exports and imports rose sharply in March 2021 For the year 202021 as a whole the merchandise trade deficit shrank to US 986 billion from US 161 billion a year ago Preliminary data released by the Ministry of Commerce Industry indicate that Indias merchandise exports and imports continue to witness broadbased robust growth performance in April 2021 The current account balance which had been recording surpluses from January 2020 through September 2020 flipped and turned into a slender deficit of 02 per cent of GDP in Q3202021 Foreign exchange reserves were at US 588 billion on April 30 2021 This gives us the confidence to deal with global spillovers 10 Domestic financial conditions remain easy on abundant and surplus system liquidity The average daily net liquidity absorption under the liquidity adjustment facility LAF was at 58 lakh crore in April 2021 The first auction under GSAP 10 conducted on April 15 2021 for a notified amount of 25000 crore elicited an enthusiastic response as reflected in the bidcover ratio of 41 GSAP has engendered a softening bias in Gsec yields which has continued since then Given this positive response from the market it has been decided that the second purchase of government securities for an aggregate amount of 35000 crore under GSAP 10 will be conducted on May 20 2021 With system liquidity assured the RBI is now focusing on increasingly channelising its liquidity operations to support growth impulses especially at the grassroot level Additional Measures 11 In the fight against the second wave alleviating any constraint from the financing side for all stake holders government hospitals and dispensaries pharmacies vaccinemedicine manufacturersimporters medical oxygen manufacturerssuppliers private operators engaged in the critical healthcare supply chain and above all the common man who may be facing sudden spike in health expenditure requires a comprehensive targeted policy response Small businesses and financial entities at the grassroot level are bearing the biggest brunt of the second wave of infections Against this backdrop and based on our continuing assessment of the macroeconomic situation and financial market conditions we propose to take further measures as enumerated below Term Liquidity Facility of 50000 crore to Ease Access to Emergency Health Services 12 To boost provision of immediate liquidity for ramping up COVID related healthcare infrastructure and services in the country an ontap liquidity window of 50000 crore with tenors of up to three years at the repo rate is being opened till March 31 2022 Under the scheme banks can provide fresh lending support to a wide range of entities including vaccine manufactures importerssuppliers of vaccines and priority medical devices hospitalsdispensaries pathology labs manufactures and suppliers of oxygen and ventilators importers of vaccines and COVID related drugs logistics firms and also patients for treatment 13 Banks are being incentivised for quick delivery of credit under the scheme through extension of priority sector classification to such lending up to March 31 2022 These loans will continue to be classified under priority sector till repayment or maturity whichever is earlier Banks may deliver these loans to borrowers directly or through intermediary financial entities regulated by the RBI Banks are expected to create a COVID loan book under the scheme By way of an additional incentive such banks will be eligible to park their surplus liquidity up to the size of the COVID loan book with the RBI under the reverse repo window at a rate which is 25 bps lower than the repo rate or termed in a different way 40 bps higher than the reverse repo rate Special LongTerm Repo Operations SLTRO for Small Finance Banks SFBs 14 Small finance banks SFBs have been playing a prominent role by acting as a conduit for last mile supply of credit to individuals and small businesses To provide further support to small business units micro and small industries and other unorganised sector entities adversely affected during the current wave of the pandemic it has been decided to conduct special threeyear longterm repo operations SLTRO of 10000 crore at repo rate for the SFBs to be deployed for fresh lending of up to 10 lakh per borrower This facility will be available till October 31 2021 Lending by Small Finance Banks SFBs to MFIs for onlending to be classified as Priority Sector Lending 15 At present lending by Small Finance Banks SFBs to MicroFinance Institutions MFIs for onlending is not reckoned for priority sector lending PSL classification In view of the fresh challenges brought on by the pandemic and to address the emergent liquidity position of smaller MFIs SFBs are now being permitted to reckon fresh lending to smaller MFIs with asset size of up to 500 crore for onlending to individual borrowers as priority sector lending This facility will be available up to March 31 2022 Credit to MSME Entrepreneurs 16 With a view to incentivise credit flow to the micro small and medium enterprise MSME borrowers in February 2021 Scheduled Commercial Banks were allowed to deduct credit disbursed to new MSME borrowers from their net demand and time liabilities NDTL for calculation of the cash reserve ratio CRR In order to further incentivise inclusion of unbanked MSMEs into the banking system this exemption currently available for exposures up to 25 lakh and for credit disbursed up to the fortnight ending October 1 2021 is being extended till December 31 2021 Resolution Framework 20 for COVID Related Stressed Assets of Individuals Small Businesses and MSMEs 17 The resurgence of COVID19 pandemic in India in recent weeks and the associated containment measures adopted at localregional levels have created new uncertainties and impacted the nascent economic revival that was taking shape In this environment the most vulnerable category of borrowers are individual borrowers small businesses and MSMEs The following set of measures are being announced today

national focus on Financial Inclusion promoting financial education and literacy and making credit available to productive sectors of the economy including the rural and MSME sector Shri V G Sekar Principal College of Agricultural Banking Heads of Priority Sector verticals of banks Members of faculty from CAB Ladies and Gentlemen Good morning 1 I thank CAB for inviting me today to discuss a critical topic that lies at the crossroads of financial institutions responsibilities and our collective vision for a better more sustainable world I propose to briefly discuss the aspect of sustainable finance to begin with before coming to the theme of the conclave that is Priority Sector Lending as I believe that there is a strong interplay between these two 2 Sustainable finance often referred to as responsible or green finance is a concept that has gained immense traction in recent years Simply put it is funding to businesses and projects that promote not only economic growth but also environmental protection social equity and responsible governance 3 The importance of sustainable finance cannot be overstated We are living in an era where climate change social inequalities and governance issues pose significant threats to the stability of economies and societies 4 For instance in India itself we can see some of these risks materialising Due to its geographic environmental and economic characteristics India is particularly vulnerable to climate change As per online sources upto June 30 2023 alone India experienced extreme weather events on 143 out of 181 days1 Variability in monsoon patterns coupled with temperature changes impact crop production and affect food security Apart from agriculture even in other sectors the economic impact of climate change in India could be substantial These risks can no longer be overlooked From a financial services industry perspective sustainable finance is a powerful tool to mitigate these risks drive positive change and ensure longterm prosperity 5 Even across the globe we are witnessing a remarkable shift towards sustainable finance Governments regulatory bodies and international organizations are actively engaged in setting standards guidelines and incentives to encourage sustainable finance practices Initiatives like the United Nations Principles for Responsible Banking2 and the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures TCFD are driving change at the global level 6 Financial institutions worldwide are integrating ESG criteria into their investment and lending decisions reflecting the growing recognition that sustainable businesses tend to be more resilient profitable and aligned with the values of an increasingly conscious consumer base The global sustainable finance market is expected to grow from USD 36 trillion in 2021 to USD 23 trillion by 20313 and in India sustainable finance has gained significant momentum in recent years as awareness of the need for sustainable development has grown 7 It is notable that the G20 New Delhi Leaders Declaration under Indias Presidency reaffirmed the G20 leaders commitment to take action to scale up sustainable finance4 They endorsed the recommendations of the Sustainable Finance Working Group SFWG which covered among others the mechanisms to support the timely and adequate mobilisation of resources for climate finance while ensuring support for transition activities in line with country circumstances5 RBI initiatives 8 On its part the Reserve Bank of India has been actively promoting the importance of green and sustainable finance within the banking sector This effort has included various forms of guidelines instructions and publications aimed at raising awareness of the opportunities and challenges associated with sustainable finance 9 As early as December 2007 RBI advised6 banks to establish Boardapproved plans of action to support sustainable development emphasizing the central role of financial institutions in this endeavour 10 More recently in May 2021 RBI took a significant step by establishing the Sustainable Finance Group SFG within its Department of Regulation This specialized unit was created to proactively address climate changerelated financial risks and lead regulatory initiatives in the realms of sustainable finance and climate risk The SFG has been actively collaborating with international standardsetting bodies central banks other financial sector regulators and the Government of India to tackle issues related to sustainable finance and climate risk 11 In July 2022 the RBI released a discussion paper on climate risk and sustainable finance furthering its commitment to driving this critical agenda forward It was followed in April 2023 by a framework for the acceptance of green deposits These interestbearing fixed deposits in Indian rupees are specifically earmarked to fund green finance initiatives which encompass projects focused on climate risk mitigation climate adaptationresilience and related objectives This initiative aims to nurture and enhance the green finance ecosystem in the country marking a significant step toward a more sustainable and environmentally conscious financial sector in India Priority Sector Lending and Financial Inclusion 12 Let me now come to the area of your specialisation ie Priority Sector Lending which is a significant component of financial inclusion in India Priority Sector Lending plays a pivotal role in ensuring that marginalized and underserved sections of the population have access to formal financial services 13 Priority Sector Lending has evolved significantly over the years transforming into a crucial aspect of credit flow from the banking system Originating in the 1960s Priority Sector Lending was conceived as a tool to direct credit toward key sectors that had been overlooked by institutional lending aligning with broader economic and social goals The composition of priority sectors and their associated targets has evolved in response to changing economic landscapes and national priorities Initially it encompassed agriculture and smallscale industries but over time it expanded to include areas such as MSMEs education renewable energy and more while also applying to a broader range of banks The guidelines for Priority Sector Lending were last updated in September 20207 introducing various adjustments including credit for loans to startups raised targets for small and marginal farmers and weaker sections and harmonizing instructions for different types of banks 14 On their part banks too have made considerable progress in meeting Priority Sector Lending targets with an achievement rate of 447 per cent as of March 31 2023 However credit gaps persist in sectors like MSMEs women entrepreneurs and agriculture underscoring the continued importance of Priority Sector Lending Priority Sector Lending and Sustainable Finance 15 How does Priority Sector Lending connect with Sustainable Finance It needs to be appreciated that sustainable finance and financial inclusion are not distinct or distant areas On the contrary they are interrelated and can reinforce each other in several ways They share common objectives of improving peoples lives and fostering economic development Sustainable finance aims to address environmental and social challenges while financial inclusion seeks to empower individuals and communities economically Further financial inclusion can enhance the resilience of vulnerable populations to environmental and climate risks by providing access to insurance products and savings mechanisms 16 The Priority Sector Lending guidelines specify eight categories of priority sectors viz i Agriculture ii MSME iii Export Credit iv Education v Housing vi Social Infrastructure vii Renewable Energy and viii Others A careful evaluation of the Priority Sector Lending categories reveals that there are elements of sustainability in nearly all these categories 17 Several significant changes and expansions have occurred in Indias Priority Sector Lending policies to promote key sectors and address important societal needs For instance in April 2015 Renewable Energy was introduced as a distinct category under Priority Sector Lending to bolster the generation and use of renewable energy sources like solar wind and more Loans up to 15 crore were allocated to borrowers for purposes such as solarbased power generators microhydel plants and nonconventional energybased public utilities Considering the limited credit uptake in the renewable energy sector the loan limit under this category was subsequently increased to 30 crore Individual households were eligible for loans of up to 10 lakh per borrower 18 Similarly Priority Sector Lending was expanded to support the agriculture sector a critical contributor to the countrys growth and employment Loans to farmers for the installation of standalone solar agriculture pumps solarization of gridconnected agriculture pumps and solar power plants on barrenfallow land or agriculture land owned by farmers were included without any specific cap further promoting sustainable agricultural practices 19 In the MSME sector an essential driver of economic and social development there are no credit caps for priority sector classification This includes loans to MSMEs engaged in activities like water supply waste management and electric power generation using renewable sources 20 Priority Sector Lending recognizes the importance of social infrastructure in enhancing the quality of life and indirectly contributing to economic development Loans up to 5 crore per borrower for initiatives like setting up schools drinking water facilities sanitation facilities and householdlevel water improvements are eligible for Priority Sector Lending classification Loans up to 10 crore per borrower for building healthcare facilities including those under Ayushman Bharat in Tier II to Tier VI centres are also included in this category 21 Thus the Priority Sector Lending guidelines in India have evolved into a dynamic and responsive framework that reflects the nations commitment to progress sustainability and inclusivity Over the years these guidelines have adapted to the changing economic landscape and emerging national priorities ensuring that financial institutions play a crucial role in promoting inclusive growth Conclusion 22 Banks as key players in the financial sector bear an inalienable responsibility in advancing the agenda of inclusive growth which is fundamental to the countrys economic and social development Therefore as senior executives of banks your role is pivotal in shaping the financial landscape of the nation It is not merely about adhering to regulatory requirements but about embracing the spirit behind the Priority Sector Lending framework It is about recognizing the imperative of reaching out to the underserved and marginalized sections of society empowering MSMEs bolstering renewable energy initiatives and facilitating access to education and healthcare 23 Proactive efforts are required in translating sustainability principles into action Therefore I would request you to go beyond mere compliance and to imbue your organizations lending policies and practices with the essence of the sustainable finance It also involves fostering a culture of financial inclusion where every loan and financial service extended contributes to the greater good of the nation It means devising innovative financial products and services that cater to the unique needs of various priority sectors be it agriculture renewable energy MSMEs or social infrastructure It entails understanding that your banks actions can have a transformative impact on the lives and livelihoods of millions of individuals and communities across India 24 I would like to end with a quote from Chanakya which I believe is very apt for the occasion Jal Bindu Nipaten Kramasha Puyate Ghatha Sa hetu sarva vidyana dharmasya cha dhansya cha Small drops of water when they come together fill up a pot Similarly knowledge good deeds or wealth add up gradually 25 Just like the small drops of water coalescing I believe collectively we have the power to chart a course toward a more prosperous equitable and sustainable future for all We can contribute to a society where financial inclusion is a reality where economic opportunities are accessible to all and where sustainability is not just a goal but a way of life 26 With this I wish this conference all success Thank you 1 As per downtoearthorgin the country experienced extreme weather events on 143 of the 181 days from January 1 to June 30 2023

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1336&fn=2754,Date Journey Towards an Inclusive and Responsible Microfinance Sector,This role encapsulates the essence of renewed national focus on Financial Inclusion promoting financial education and literacy and making credit available to productive sectors of the economy including the rural and MSME sector Ladies and Gentlemen At the outset I would like to thank MFIN for inviting me to this event In an earlier speech2 last year in October I had highlighted some of the aspects typical to the borrowers and lenders in the microfinance sector These related to over indebtedness of the borrowers pricing of microfinance loans besides conduct related issues I had also stressed that emerging dynamics in the microfinance sector as well as the concerns around customer protection necessitated a review of the regulations so that all the regulated entities engaged in micro finance pursue the goal of customer protection within a wellcalibrated and harmonized setup To address these concerns the Reserve Bank in March 2022 came out with revised regulatory framework for microfinance sector This is one of the first comprehensive activity based regulatory framework While previously I highlighted certain concerns today I propose to discuss a bit on the solutions that we have put in place in the form of the revised framework trying to give you a glimpse of what we did and why we did Further considering the large customer base of microfinance at 6 crore borrowers3 this is perhaps an appropriate occasion to assess the impact of microfinance on the overall macroeconomy and think of ways by which microfinance can make a more meaningful contribution to the economic development Microfinance has emerged as one of most important tools to foster financial inclusion It enables the poor and lowincome households to come out of poverty helps women to become owners of assets have an increased say in decision making and lead dignified lives embodying the concept of a collective good Indeed microfinance plays a critical role in promoting inclusive growth by way of making credit available at the last mile and therefore acts as a safety net for those at the bottom of the pyramid I believe that the holistic impact of microfinance goes much beyond the impact created by any other credit facility Borrowers often utilize the loans for health and education apart from incomegenerating activities and it helps them deal with everyday emergencies that they encounter The story of microfinance in India has been a story of growth and inclusiveness As on 30 June 2022 total microfinance loan portfolio stands at 293 lakh crore in which banks hold the largest share of 38 per cent followed closely by NBFCMFIs at 35 per cent SFBs other NBFCs and other entities have a combined share of 27 per cent Taken together with loan portfolio under SHGbank linkage the overall size of the microfinance loan portfolio is around 482 lakh crore Just to provide a perspective of the scale of microfinance sector aggregate credit of all NBFCs excluding HFCs stood at 285 lakh crore in March 2022 From a macro perspective microfinance loan portfolio across all lenders is roughly 15 of the aggregate NBFC credit In terms of reach microfinance operations cover 28 states and 9 union territories UTs In terms of regional distribution eastern northeastern regions of the country have the largest share at 37 per cent followed by south at 27 percent and west at 15 per cent Thus in impacting the lives and livelihoods the role of microfinance continues to be important While microfinance is present in almost all nooks and corners of the country in terms of geographical distribution 82 per cent of the loan portfolio is concentrated in ten states Hopefully going forward the spread could be diversified Regulatory timeline for microfinance sector It was thirty years ago in 1992 that an innovative model to harness the synergy of flexibility of an informal system with the strength and affordability of a formal system was launched in the form of SelfHelp Group Bank Linkage Programme Since then a slew of policy measures and approaches have been put in place to bring the financially excluded population within the ambit of formal financial institutions While microfinance journey started with SHGBank Linkage Program SBLP microfinance institutions subsequently also adopted Joint Liability Group JLG mechanism SBLP which was launched in 1992 on a pilot basis has since grown significantly to 674 lakh SHGs having an outstanding loan amount of approximately 15 lakh crore as of March 2022 leading to social economic and financial empowerment of the poor especially the women A comprehensive regulatory framework for NBFCMFIs was first introduced by the Reserve Bank in December 2011 wherein eligibility criterion for microfinance loans linked to core features of microfinance was prescribed ie small collateral free loans to borrowers belonging to lowincome groups Besides the regulations laid special emphasis on protection of borrowers and adoption of fair practices in lending such as transparency in charges ceilings on margins and interest rates no prepayment penalty flexible repayment schedules noncoercive methods of recovery and measures to contain multiple lending and overindebtedness Introduction of a comprehensive regulatory framework for NBFCMFIs with a mandate of providing credit to lowincome households meant that fundamental structure for provision of credit to the excluded section was in place But this addressed only part of the problem On one hand we had commercial banks which were providing savings products to the poor but were a bit wary in providing smallticket loans On the other hand there were NBFCMFIs which were providing smallticket loans but could not offer savings related services To overcome this a differentiated category of banks viz small finance banks SFBs was introduced which could offer deposit facilities and have a mandate of providing a certain percentage of their loans as small ticket loans In essence SFBs could meet the entire financial needs of a lowincome household under one umbrella Over last decade the landscape of the microfinance sector has undergone a significant change from being an MFI dominated proposition to becoming a bastion of banks including SFBs This has been primarily driven by conversion4 of some large NBFCMFIs to banks and consolidation in the microfinance sector Consequently the share of standalone MFIs ie NBFCMFIs in the overall microfinance sector loan portfolio has come down significantly over last few years This had led to a situation where the specific customer protection measures designed to protect the interests of vulnerable microfinance borrowers were not being adopted by a larger number of lenders thus negating the primary objective of the regulations Against this backdrop Reserve Bank came out with a comprehensive and revised regulatory framework for microfinance loans in March 2022 Our intent in framing these guidelines was built around the idea of customer protection To achieve the framework has incorporated five core principles namely i Addressing regulatory arbitrage with the introduction of a lender agnostic and activitybased regulation so that all the regulated entities engaged in microfinance pursue the goal of customer protection within a wellcalibrated and harmonized setup ii Protection of microfinance borrowers from overindebtedness caused by granting of loans beyond the repayment capacity of the borrowers which then can potentially get manifested into coercive recovery practices iii Enabling the competitive forces to bring down the interest rates by way of enhanced transparency measures iv Enhancement of customer protection measures by way of strengthening them and extending them to all regulated entities v Facilitating flexibility to design products services to meet the needs of microfinance borrower in a comprehensive manner This framework has been finalized after extensive internal deliberations issuance of a consultative document and after taking into consideration the feedback received I would like to take this opportunity to delve deeper into the thought process behind the revised regulations and spell out the regulatory intent Household Income and Repayment Criteria Earlier a microfinance borrower of an NBFCMFI was identified by the annual household income of maximum 125 lakh for rural and 2 lakh for urban and semiurban areas and the limit of 125 lakh on loan amount was prescribed for the individual borrower To meet the growing needs of existing borrowers of MFIs and changing demographics threshold on household income has been harmonized between rural and urban households to a uniform household income limit of 3 lakh While increasing the eligible loan amount the new framework also envisages a situation where a household who is in lower band of the household income limit is provided loans consistent with their repayment capacity The emphasis now is on the repayment capacity of the borrowers rather than considering only indebtedness per se or indebtedness from only NBFCMFIs in isolation Therefore a common definition of microfinance loans has been prescribed for all regulated entities and maximum loan amount has been linked to household income There have been some demands for further increasing the household income limit While for now it seems adequate given the profile and needs of microfinance borrowers one needs to be cognizant of the fact that other channels are always available for entities intending to provide higher loan amounts Pricing and Transparency Under the new framework rulebased guidelines on pricing of loans have been replaced with a principlebased framework based on enhanced disclosures and transparency requirements One major change is the introduction of a simplified fact sheet which spells out the methodology for calculation of allinclusive effective interest rate This ensures comparability of interest rates across different lenders It needs to be understood that the effective interest rate in the fact sheet reflects allinclusive cost of the loan to the borrower and not the internal rate of return IRR of the lender There have been some demands that insurance charges should not be included in the calculation of effective interest rate There does not seem to be any logic for excluding some components from the calculation of allinclusive cost of the borrower which she he is actually paying The insurance charges included in the calculations are for credit linked insurance which would be utilised to settle the loan in case of an unfortunate event like death or disability of the borrower and are linked to the microfinance loan In other words a borrower would not have incurred these charges if he had not taken the loan All things being equal credit risk premium on an insured loan should be lower than an uninsured loan Therefore any increase in IRR due to inclusion of insurance charges is expected to be compensated to some extent by way of reduction in the risk premium of the borrower of an insured loan At a broader level it needs to be understood that the intent of regulation is to make the borrower aware of the total cost being paid by him for the loan and at the same time ensuring comparability amongst the lenders by standardizing the calculation of allinclusive cost It is expected that availability of such information will help the borrowers in making an informed choice while assessing the available options In addition to specific pricing related regulations this framework needs to be seen in a holistic manner wherein certain indirect but equally important measures have been introduced to bring down the interest rate Let me elaborate First of all a cap on repayment obligations is expected to nudge the lenders to keep the interest rates low so that the repayment instalments do not exceed the maximum prescribed limit for repayment obligation Second measures to check overindebtedness should also result in improvement of credit worthiness of the borrowers bringing down the credit risk premium which should translate into lower interest rates Third enhanced awareness among borrowers through simplified factsheet and no prepayment penalty on microfinance loans would enable them to easily switch between lenders Fourth a reduction in the minimum threshold of microfinance loans for NBFCMFIs from 85 of net assets to 75 per cent of total assets is expected to lower their concentration risk and cost of funds Fifth and finally an increase in the maximum threshold on microfinance loans for other NBFCs from 10 to 25 of total assets should increase competition All these five elements should collectively help in bringing down the credit cost for the borrower Addressing Regulatory Arbitrage and Operational Inflexibility In 2011 microfinance sector was still evolving and there was a need to introduce a rulebased regulatory framework to bring some order in the sector Over last decade the sector has come a long way The prudent practices in the microfinance sector are well laid out and are better understood now Therefore product specific requirements for microfinance loans such as an absolute limit on loan amount limit on number of lenders minimum tenure of loan etc which were anyway applicable to only NBFCMFIs have been withdrawn The new framework provides the flexibility to lenders to customize their products and services to better meet the needs of microfinance borrowers While the harmonization of regulations between the two largest contributors to microfinance loan portfolio viz NBFCMFIs and banks has been deliberated extensively harmonization of regulations between NBFCMFIs and other NBFCs has not received the required attention I would like to highlight one significant change that has been introduced to address the risks in the business models of some NBFCMFIs Earlier the threshold on microfinance loan portfolio of NBFCMFIs was calculated as a percentage of net assets which meant that NBFCMFIs could potentially have a significantly large share of their total assets deployed in the form of bank balances It was observed that some of the NBFCMFIs were largely acting as the business correspondents of the banks thus subverting the entire premise of the business of a financial institution as provided under the Reserve Bank of India Act ie lending from their books Besides addressing regulatory arbitrage with NBFCs computation of microfinance loan portfolio of an NBFCMFI as a percentage of total assets also ensures that NBFCMFIs focus on their core business Responsibilities of the Board Conduct The new framework while laying down the fundamental principles places greater onus on the Boards of the regulated entities as they are now also required to have Board approved policies in certain areas such as assessment of household income and indebtedness pricing of microfinance loans and conduct of employees etc The framework in particular emphasizes on having a system for recruitment training and monitoring of employees Training modules for employees and outsourced personnel should include programs to inculcate appropriate behavior towards customers and their conduct towards customers should also be incorporated appropriately in their compensation matrix The guidelines related to adherence to fair practices in recovery of loans and outsourcing of activities have also been reiterated One important aspect of these guidelines is that outsourcing of any activity by the regulated entity does not diminish its obligations and it shall be accountable for inappropriate behaviour by its employees or employees of the outsourced agency and shall provide timely grievance redressal for both Given the responsibilities entrusted on the Boards the directors on the Boards of the lenders should take active interest in the policies governing the microfinance loans in order to ensure that these policies result in a fair treatment to the microfinance borrowers Expectations from the Industry The revised regulatory framework provides significant flexibility to the lenders to fulfil the needs of their microfinance customers in a comprehensive and customized manner With increasing competition and level playing field for all regulated entities in the sector one of the differentiating factors going forward will be the customers experience with the lenders services The new framework has put in place a few ground rules to address concerns around misconduct towards microfinance borrowers Conduct towards customer being integral to ethical business practices it becomes the responsibility of everyone involved in the process to ensure that the guidelines on conduct are followed in both letter and spirit and the customer is treated fairly and respectfully at all times To ensure borrowers protection from coercive recovery practices new framework also requires putting in place a mechanism for engagement with borrowers facing repayment related difficulties prohibition on harsh recovery practices extensive due diligence process for engagement of recovery agents and a dedicated mechanism for redressal of recovery related grievances While we acknowledge the rights of the lenders to recover overdue loans I would like to make it clear in no uncertain terms that the Reserve Bank has zero tolerance for misconduct towards the borrowers You would agree that exclusive focus on business growth and bottom lines without considering the vulnerabilities of the borrowers by any entity is fraught with pitfalls Irresponsible lending by a few lenders ends up putting the interests of entire industry at risk Therefore it is the collective responsibility of all the lenders and the SROs to keep a check on any sharp and aggressive practices in the sector There are sufficient avenues in the microfinance sector to grow the business as availability of credit to last mile still remains an unfinished agenda The industry should work towards increasing the size of pie while balancing the interests of the vulnerable borrowers In this regard I am happy to note that the revamped Code of Conduct CoC was recently launched on 4th October 2022 The Code of Conduct is as an industryled initiative with primary focus being to promote and advance responsible lending practices for protection of customers The seven elements enumerated in the code viz fair interaction suitability education transparency information privacy grievance redressal employee engagement and customer communication essentially capture the range of issues which the revised framework also encapsulated However as for any voluntary regulation to work as intended it is incumbent upon all the players to adhere to the Code both in letter and spirit Going forward there is a strong case for adoption of technology in the microfinance sector to not only improve efficiencies and bring down the operational costs but to also mitigate operational risks such as frauds enhance service experience and create customer awareness Leveraging of digital solutions can enable the microfinance lenders to increase their productivity manifold across the entire lending cycle Microfinance lenders with their hightouch models are best placed to handhold their customers for developing familiarity with technology which will enhance their awareness about the opportunities available to them This way the lenders can go beyond a transactional arrangement of just meeting the credit needs of the borrower to a transformational relationship with the customers resulting in positive externalities in terms of the social benefits This will further ensure that access to institutional microcredit also enables the borrowers to explore opportunities for generating income in a sustainable manner besides meeting their immediate needs for money Concluding remarks MFIN has been instrumental in multiple initiatives to strengthen the sector during the decade and to develop the microfinance ecosystem The current MFIN microfinance review report provides datasupported insights and it has been enriched with MFINs experience The report discusses in detail the organic evolution of the microfinance sector and the supporting ecosystem leading up to the new regulations My compliments to MFIN and the whole team for bringing out this report It has been our constant endeavor to support microfinance sector by addressing regulatory gaps and arbitrage arising from differential regulations across the spectrum of entities Towards this objective we have introduced structural changes by revamping the regulatory framework for microfinance loans in March 2022 We would like to see through its successful implementation on ground before taking further steps Let me again say albeit at the cost of repetition that customer protection lies at the core of microfinance regulation and it has been our guiding light while revamping the regulatory regime for the microfinance sector We have attempted to move from a rulebased approach to a principlebased approach thus creating enabling environment for more financial institutions to serve the excluded while protecting their interests through competition and transparency I am hopeful that these regulatory reforms will provide the requisite impetus for the long but immensely fulfilling journey towards an inclusive and responsible microfinance sector Thank you 1 Keynote address delivered by Shri M Rajeshwar Rao Deputy Governor Reserve Bank of India on November 04 2022 at the launch of MFINs India

imperative realising its importance in economic development and social wellbeing of the populace We have come a long way in our pursuit for financial inclusion which started with promotion of cooperatives nationalization of banks institutionalisation of priority sector lending and lead bank scheme implementation of BC model and more recently with Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana PMJDY In this journey we have adjusted our strategies and policy focus factoring in the changing demographics economic situation and social needs Given the wide geographical spread and the need to include large unbanked population the policy thrust for a long time had been on providing access to basic financial services It is quite rightly recognised that access to a bank and a bank account is the first step toward broader financial inclusion since it enables people to carry out basic banking functions such as remittances besides acting as a gateway to access other financial services In this effort RBI mandated banks to open branches in underbanked pockets which led to a considerable increase in bank branches and later Automated Teller Machines ATMs in the 1990s to early 2000s A roadmap for having banking outlets in villages with population more than 2000 in 2009 and less than 2000 in 2012 was also prepared Subsequently the banks were advised to open brick and mortar branches in villages with population of more than 5000 To strengthen financial inclusion the branch authorisation guidelines were relaxed and Financial Inclusion Fund FIF with an initial corpus of 2000 crore was established to support adoption of technology and capacity building Financial inclusion was also a one of the consideration for issue of differentiated banking license for Small Finance Banks SFBs and Payments Banks PBs in 2015 The SFBs were setup to further financial inclusion through tailored deposit products and for providing credit to small business units small and marginal farmers micro and small industries and other unorganized sector entities through technology led lowcost operations Payments Banks were also set up to provide small savings accounts and payments remittance services to migrant labour workforce lowincome households small businesses and other unorganised sector entities other users The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana PMJDY and National Strategy for Financial Inclusion NSFI 20192024 has given a further fillip to these efforts The NSFI defines the vision and key objectives of the financial inclusion policies in India to help expand and sustain the financial inclusion process at the national level through a broad convergence of action involving all the stakeholders in the financial sector The strategy aims to provide access to formal financial services in an affordable manner broadening deepening financial inclusion and promoting financial literacy consumer protection while the reach of the banks amongst the ranks of the underserved got a boost through the PMJDY Some data would help us get a perspective Under PMJDY 4640 Crore beneficiary accounts have been opened so far with outstanding balance of 173 Lakh Crore in these accounts2 As of June 2022 there are 159 Lakh branches operated by SCBs with a total deposit of more than 170 lakh crore rupees3 which translates to close to approximately 15 branches per 1 lakh of population This is further complemented by a network of 217 lakh ATMs4 out of which 47 are in rural and semiurban areas and there are close to 32 lakh Business Correspondents engaged by banks5 As per data from World Banks Global Findex Database as of 2021 78 of Indian adults population with 15 years or more of age had a bank account as compared to 53 in 2014 We have been able to provide banking access to almost every village within a 5 km radius in 25 states and 7 UTs covering 9994 of identified villages But we cannot remain content with this and efforts are continuing to achieve universal access to financial services and products At the same time the policy focus is being repositioned from access of financial services alone to Usage and Quality of financial services as well The FIIndex constructed by RBI which is an indicator of our efforts in this direction is based on the above three dimensions viz Access Usage and Quality The weights of the index are forwardlooking with higher weights given to the deepening aspect of financial inclusion Usage and Quality Responsible and sustained financial inclusion requires balancing opportunity and innovation on both the supply and demand side On the supply side it includes steps to provide affordable and easy access to savings account and suite of appropriate financial products services On the demand side it seeks to improve financial literacy and awareness which helps in increasing demand for financial products and services These demand side and supply side measures should ideally complement each other In emerging market economies like India there is generally a disequilibrium amongst the demand and supply side factors While the traditional brick and mortar structures have helped in taking basic banking services to the nook and corners of our country the advent of digital innovations in the extension of financial services have the potential to be an enabler for graduating to the next level of financial inclusion where the quality of inclusion takes precedence over just availability of financial services India as a continental economy with multiple languages and cultures different and sometimes even difficult terrains large population and lowincome levels need to ensure inclusive growth The focus is thus not only on opening the bank accounts but also making available a bouquet of financial services transactions payments savings insurance and ensure easily accessible and affordable credit to the customers Inclusive credit will have to be the bed rock of inclusive financial inclusion The Committee on Financial Inclusion Chairman Dr C Rangarajan RBI 2008 explicitly included timely and adequate credit at an affordable cost for vulnerable groups in the definition of the financial inclusion The Committee on MediumTerm Path to Financial Inclusion Chairman Shri Deepak Mohanty RBI 2015 also emphasized on increasing the access of small and marginal enterprises to formal finance Thus access to credit has always been an integral part of RBIs efforts towards furthering the financial inclusion let me dwell a little bit on provision of inclusive credit Importance of inclusive credit Access to credit acts as a force multiplier if utilized optimally by individuals as well as firms For individuals it helps to meet their financial and enterprising needs and also where required reduce their vulnerability to economic shocks whereas for firms it enables normal business operations besides allowing them to plan for investments in newer and more productive technologies Business diversification and expansion helps them grow thereby leading to increase in job opportunities and in general promote economic development Without adequate timely and affordable access to formal credit the customers are dependent upon either own equity or informal sources of credit both of which are not only costly but perhaps unsustainable on a longterm basis However a challenge in our financial inclusion journey is to enhance the level of activity and utilisation of diverse financial products and services following opening of a bank account In this background going digital way seems to be a solution for all the obstacles However this is easier said than done RBI and inclusive credit In this endeavour RBI has adopted a threepronged strategy which involves Setting up of financial intermediaries for extending digital credit or facilitating digital loans Nurturing technological infrastructure to ensure safe and seamless credit disbursal and adopting a Customerfirst regulatory approach Let me share a perspective on each of these three focus areas Setting up of financial intermediaries for extending credit As a first step in tackling supply side issues in the financial inclusion new financial intermediaries have been introduced for provision of credit and to ensure financial services are available to the customer at when and where basis thus translating into a truly anywhere anytime banking This includes P2P lending Platform In first of such initiatives RBI came out with P2P regulations at a time when the industry itself was at a nascent stage of development A Peer to Peer Lending Platform provides an online ontap avenue to both borrowers to avail and investor to extend mostly small ticket loans The regulations have been designed in a way to ensure that the framework does not impinge upon the innovative lending services while at the same time seeking to protect customers interests and minimising systemic concerns Digital Only NBFCs Second RBI came out with registration guidelines for DigitalOnly NBFCs as the name suggests is an NBFC running solely on a digital platform without any brickandmortar presence except for administrative purpose RBI enabled healthy innovation in credit intermediation by permitting the setting up an NBFC over a digital platform in 2018 Though not a new category of NBFC their licensing conditions mandates on them to provide their products only in a digital mode Here too protection of consumers have been kept paramount and the entities are required to maintain audit trails by putting in place required IT infrastructure with adequate safeguards on unauthorised access alteration and destruction of data if any Regulatory features such as explicit consent for data sharing domestic location of servers maintaining audit trails information security audit etc are progressive and at the same time preemptive in nature Digital Banking Unit With digital banking emerging as the preferred mode of delivery along with brick and mortar banking outlets the concept of Digital Banking Units was announced in the Union Budget 202223 and the guidelines for operationalising these units were issued by RBI earlier this year Scheduled Commercial Banks have been authorised to set up digital banking units which are intended as specialised fixed point business units housing certain minimum digital infrastructure for delivering digital banking products services as well as servicing existing financial products digitally in both selfservice and assisted mode It is expected that such units would enable customers to have costeffective convenient and enhanced digital experience of such products and services in an efficient paperless secured and connected environment with most services being available in selfservice mode at any time Creating market infrastructure for inclusive credit India has made significant strides in creating enabling digital infrastructure in financial services space UPI GSTN TReDS JAM Trinity and Account Aggregators AA to cite a few This strong ensemble of digital infrastructure has stabilised and as it matures would pave way for expansion of credit in a seamless and timely manner which could be made digitally available in an almost paperless environment AAs capability to aggregate financial data spread across different financial service providers and to leverage this data to build analytics and insights to help consumers in their financial planning would allow financial service providers to offer customized products to their customers The AA framework also has an important element of electronic consent architecture which is an improvement upon the open banking regimes of many developed countries As UPI transformed the way people pay the Account Aggregator has potential to transform credit by making it more seamless and accessible for everyone using digital infrastructure The JAM trinity has done wonders for FI The next trinity consisting of UPI eKYC and AA is expected to enable the next revolution in banking in the provision of customised and inclusive credit services Customerfirst regulatory approach A paradigm shift in digital lending was noticed during the pandemic Post outbreak of Covid19 there was a spurt of online lending platforms mobile lending apps with a study6 estimating that downloads of lending apps increased by 21 during the Covid pandemic In earlier times people used to talk of the 363 rule in banking alluding to the banking practices in 1950s right down to the 1970s as a result of the simplistic and noncompetitive conditions in the industry The rule was to raise deposits at 3 lend at 6 and play golf after 3 PM However FinTech revolution has transformed this into a 210 formula 2 minutes to decide 1 minute to transfer the money with zero human to human contact This change in the banking business model with supportive technological transformations has expanded the realm of whats possible The Working Group on Digital Lending set up last year by the RBI noted that lending through digital mode relative to physical mode is still at a nascent stage in the case of banks 112 lakh crore via digital mode7 visvis 5308 lakh crore via physical mode for NBFCs a higher proportion of lending 023 lakh crore via digital mode visvis 193 lakh crore via physical mode is being routed through digital mode8 However if we observe the growth in overall volume of disbursement through digital mode it has exhibited a massive twelvefold growth between 2017 and 2020 The digital lending landscape has seen a rapid rise in innovative models for product delivery including Point of Sale PoS transactionsbased lending BankFinTech partnership models marketplace lending and bankled digital models However most of the digital lending is being enabled by bankNBFC FinTech partnerships where FinTechs are acting as Lending Service Providers LSPs for banks NBFCs However with the expansion of digital lending various concerns have also emerged These primarily relate to the unbridled engagement of third parties misselling breach of data privacy unfair business conduct exorbitant interest rates and unethical recovery practices As a preemptive measure RBI came out with a circular on digital lending on June 24 2020 wherein it was advised that digital lending platforms shall disclose the name of bank NBFC upfront on whose behalf they are providing credit ensure that sanction letter is on the letterhead of the bank NBFC concerned and banks NBFCs in turn will ensure adequate oversight over the digital lending platforms engaged by them The Working Group on Digital Lending delved deeper into the concerns arising out of digital lending ecosystem The recently announced regulatory framework for digital lending encapsulates RBIs approach of customerfirst regulations The framework is designed to strike a balance between the need for an innovative and inclusive system while at the same time ensuring that regulatory arbitrage is not exploited to the detriment of the customers interest Another underlying theme of this regulatory framework is that the onus of complying with the regulatory guidelines rests with the regulated entities and they will have to ensure that the loan service facilitators and digital lending Apps with which they have outsourcing tie ups functions within the regulatory ecosystem not just in letter but also in spirit Looking Ahead The deepening and widening of financial inclusion will drive the growth in financialization of savings in India Increasing adoption of digital modes GSTN online shopping P2P payments QR code deployment and everything else together will generate reams of customer data This data could be potentially utilised to chart customer needs behaviour and repayment capacity and help in digital inclusion One specific area where digital lending has the potential to be a catalyst for economic growth is cashflow based lending to MSMEs MSMEs are an important engine of growth for the Indian economy as they contribute around 45 of exports and provide employment opportunities to more than 111 crore people The provision of appropriate credit for MSMEs through seamless and digital cashflow based lending will provide them with the muchneeded impetus It would enable lenders to leverage real time cashflow data to reimagine endtoend lending process and sachetisation of products On the other hand additional measures recommended by the Working Group on Digital Lending viz establishment of Digital India Trust Agency DIGITA a SelfRegulatory Organisation SRO and the recommended proposed legislative interventions like restricting balance sheet lending through digital mode to authorized entities only by framing a legislation styled as Banning of Unregulated Lending Activities BULA Act on the lines of Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes BUDS Act 2019 would go a long way in creating a digital lending ecosystem which is safe and sound Conclusion The challenge for the regulator in a fastdeveloping economy like ours is to keep pace with the market innovations and strive to strike a balance between ensuring safety without stifling innovation which is never an easy task Responsible financial innovation requires balancing innovative products with necessary safeguards for ensuring financial system stability and customer protection Therefore while appreciating and recognising the benefits emanating from digital credit we need to take cognizance of the attendant risks such as data privacy disruptive business models aggressive recovery methods and exorbitant interest rates As a regulator we have been following a nuanced approach for industry market development and this is reflected in bringing out an appropriate regulatory framework for digital lending By empowering individuals and firms to cultivate economic opportunities digital credit can be a powerful agent for a sustainable and inclusive growth We must remember that financial inclusion is not just a goal but also a means to an end as an enabler for sustainable economic growth reduction of inequality and eliminating poverty Financial inclusion has been identified by the United Nations as an enabler for 7 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals At its best digital credit need to be responsible inclusive and affordable which is something every financial institution should strive for As always we at the RBI would continue with our efforts to create an enabling regulatory ecosystem for financial innovation protection of customers interest and strengthening of the financial infrastructure Thank you 1 Remarks delivered by Shri M Rajeshwar Rao Deputy Governor Reserve Bank of India on September 08 2022 at ASSOCHAMs 17th Annual Summit Awards on

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1194&fn=2754,Date Financial Inclusion Empowers Monetary Policy,This role encapsulates the essence of renewed national focus on Financial Inclusion promoting financial education and literacy and making credit available to productive sectors of the economy including the rural and MSME sector Prof Errol DSouza Director Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad or IIMA Prof Umakant Dash Director Institute of Rural Management Anand or IRMA Dr Supriya Sharma PartnerInsights Centre for Innovation Incubation and Entrepreneurship or CIIE representatives of the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation BMGF faculty students and staff of IIMA and friends I commend all of you on this laudable initiative of Financial Inclusion for Rural Transformation It raises the bar by seeking to examine the entire value chain of financial inclusion and its effect on women empowerment with the help of research existing and new data and field experiments I look forward to the findings especially which financial inclusion products work where and why I am honoured to be given the opportunity to launch this project Drawing from what I do for a living I thought I will share my thoughts on how financial inclusion empowers monetary policy and why people matter for its effective conduct Financial inclusion in the sense of access to the formal financial system for basic financial services at a reasonable cost is now positioned as a policy objective in more than 60 countries It is also central to the United Nations UNs 2030 Sustainable Development Goals SDGs and the G 20s Action Plan on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Several direct developmental effects are attributed to financial inclusion such as greater mobilisation of savings improving conditions for remittances boosting fiscal revenues and improving the effectiveness of fiscal transfers Rather than a lever or a growth multiplier however it is widely viewed as enhancing the quality of growth by fostering inclusivity and by enabling other developmental goals such as poverty eradication reduction of inequality and women empowerment to name a few Given this overwhelmingly developmental focus on financial inclusion the relationship between financial inclusion and monetary policy is obviously unfashionable Recently however interest is growing in the effects of financial inclusion on the conduct of monetary policy and its contribution to human welfare through this channel The initial conditions to spur this interest were always in existence The UNs Capital Development Fund or UNCDF reports evidence of financial inclusion contributing to stabler financial systems Financially included economic agents appear to be able to ride out interest rate cycles procyclically instead of being impacted countercyclically In my remarks today I would like to contribute to this growing interest in the symbiosis between financial inclusion and monetary policy by a assimilating the received wisdom and empirical evidence that has been accumulated so far on the subject and b drawing applicable lessons therefrom for India This assumes relevance in the context of the pandemic during which the loss of life and livelihood impacted the financially disadvantaged and vulnerable households and businesses the most Drawing upon its experience with financial inclusion the RBI crafted a pandemic response that reached out in the form of unconventional measures to those afflicted sections of society keeping finance flowing and financial institutions and markets functional especially when personal incomes were lost and the future was highly uncertain In this endeavour I am emboldened by the significant milestone that the Reserve Bank of India RBI has passed in its journey towards financially empowering all Indians I refer to the construction and public release of a national financial inclusion index FIIndex in September 2021 The index is based on 97 indicators representing access or the supply of financial inclusion infrastructure usage or demand for financial services and quality or inequality in access and usage due to lack of financial literacy and protection The index takes values from 0 to 100 and implicitly sets the goal for the RBI 100 per cent financial inclusion for India By 2021 we have passed the halfway mark doing best in access or the supply of the financial infrastructure and lagging the most in usage or demand to be financially included This assumes importance from the point of view of the ambitious agenda set up by the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion NSFI 201924 and the National Strategy for Financial Education NFSE 202025 in its vision of a financially literate and empowered India There are other collateral benefits attached to the FIIndex For the first time efforts towards expanding financial inclusion can be transparently evaluated against a publicly available and quantifiable metric Furthermore a measurable indicator of financial inclusion can be incorporated into monetary policy rules and reaction functions to examine its correlation with output and inflation and their volatility For the first time the influence of financial inclusion on the size and timing of policy rate changes can be gauged Monetary policy maximises human welfare by minimising the deviations of output from its potential and inflation from the target Although it is empirically observed that there is a twoway relationship between monetary policy and financial inclusion it is unambiguous that financial inclusion is able to dampen inflation and output volatility This is achieved by smoothing consumption by enabling people to draw down financial savings in difficult times for everyday needs In the process it makes people interestsensitive Moreover inflation targeting monetary policy ensures that even those at the fringe of financial inclusion are secured from adverse income shocks that hit them when prices rise unconscionably At the cost of being slightly technical therefore the rest of my remarks will address four issues that sit at the heart of this confluence first the choice of the appropriate price index as the population gets progressively included financially second the impact of financial inclusion on output and inflation variability and the tradeoff between them the dilemma that is central to the conduct of monetary policy third the transmission of monetary policy impulses through the economy and fourth the impact of financial awareness on expectations and hence on the credibility of monetary policy In the final analysis financial inclusion fosters societal intolerance to inflation a social preference for macroeconomic stability and a sense of the long and variable lags with which monetary policy operates This makes it possible for smaller monetary policy actions to achieve the same goals in a shorter period of time than otherwise II The Choice of Price Index Which measure of inflation should monetary policy target to maximise welfare Financial inclusion appears to be the lowest in rural agriculturedependent areas where food is the main source of income Recent work in the tradition of dualistic models shows that in the presence of financial frictions in this case financially excluded or creditconstrained consumers existing alongside those that have full access to formal finance flexibly determined food prices have a critical role to play in influencing the real wages and incomes of the excluded and hence their aggregate demand Interest rate change dont matter so much When food prices rise the extra income earned by the financially excluded is not saved but instead consumption is increased leading to higher aggregate demand In this kind of a situation the efficacy of monetary policy in achieving its stabilisation objective increases by targeting a measure of prices that includes food prices rather than one that excludes them such as core inflation The lower the level of financial inclusion therefore the stronger is the case for price stability being defined in terms of headline inflation rather than any measure of core inflation that strips out food and fuel In India food accounts for 46 per cent of the CPI among the highest shares anywhere in the world Furthermore the CPI combines a rural index and an urban index with the share of food being even higher in the rural index at 542 per cent In the urban index too the share of food at 363 per cent is also sizable in a crosscountry perspective Consequently aggregate demand is highly influenced by the behaviour of food prices and farm output rather than interest rate changes to which the urban index could be sensitive It is in this context that the monetary policy framework overhaul in 2016 to usher in a flexible inflation targeting regime wisely chose the headline CPI as its metric for measuring the inflation target rather than any measure of core inflation despite persuasive arguments for the latter that are made even today Headline CPI inflation averaged 39 per cent since the institution of flexible inflation targeting right up to the onset of the pandemic in March 2020 ie during October 2016 March 2020 With the first onslaught of COVID19 headline inflation breached the upper tolerance band and averaged 62 per cent in 202021 Strong supply side interventions to expand access to buffer stocks and imports to incentivise productivity and lowering of taxes tamed the upsurge and aligned headline inflation again with the target barring shortlived spikes due to inclement weather in key vegetable producing areas Food inflation has been volatile throughout this period reflecting the incidence of supply shocks on the production of items to which inflation is particularly reactive It rose from an average of 29 per cent during the FIT period of 201620 to 74 per cent in 202021 at the height of the first wave of the pandemic but the policy interventions have managed to temper it to 35 per cent in AprilNovember 2021 Stabilising farm incomes and food availability through the pandemic via transfers of both cash and kind has been a key policy mission Coincidentally financial inclusion appears to have gone up with the level of the RBIs financial inclusion index rising from 499 in March 2019 to 531 in March 2020 and further to 539 in March 2021 The evidence is still forming and strong conclusions from its analysis may be premature but Indias monetary policy is by design financially inclusive and it will reap the benefits of this strategy in the future in terms of effectiveness and welfare maximisation III Stabilising OutputInflation Variability As I mentioned earlier the responsibility assigned to monetary policy is to keep output close to or at its potential and inflation aligned to its target Financially included consumers are able to smooth consumption in the face of shocks because of their access to savings deposits and credit from the formal financial system in the event of income losses On the other hand financially excluded consumers are not able to do so and hence they are vulnerable to higher volatility in consumption spending and output An economy with all consumers financially included would expect to experience less output volatility due to lower consumption volatility In an economy with financially excluded consumers monetary policy has to assign a greater weight to stabilising output Overarchingly however it is inflation volatility that affects all consumers whether included or excluded Therefore minimising inflation volatility should be the predominant objective of monetary policy in its welfare maximising role It follows that the larger the share of financially excluded people in an economy the more the central bank has to pay attention to output stabilisation at the cost of focusing on inflation stabilisation As financial inclusion rises monetary policy can hone its ability to stabilise inflation and reap welfare gains for society at large In India the issue of financial inclusion and its role in shaping the monetary policy reaction function was recognised from the very outset while instituting the flexible inflation targeting framework Accordingly price stability was assigned primacy among the goals of monetary policy with output being a secondary objective to turn to only after price stability as defined numerically in terms of 4 per cent with a tolerance band of 2 per cent around it has been achieved To quote from the RBI Act as amended in 2016 The primary objective of monetary policy is to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth As I pointed out earlier this has been largely achieved but for the exceptional experience with the pandemic and looking ahead inflation is expected to trend down over the next two years to converge to the target as pointed out in the RBIs October 2021 Monetary Policy Report Furthermore there is some evidence that financial inclusion has worked in the same direction as the reforms in the monetary policy framework in the assignment of weights to inflation and output gaps The Report on Currency and Finance 202021 estimates that the coefficient on the deviation of inflation from the target was 041 in the period 200011 with 075 as the coefficient on the deviation of output from its potential During 201620 the period of the flexible inflation targeting framework up to the pandemics first wave the weight on the inflation gap rose to 070 while the weight on the output gap fell to 026 clearly revealing an increasing focus on stabilising inflation relative to output This resulted in stabilising expectations winning foreign investor confidence and earning credibility for the conduct of monetary policy Although relatively unsung rising financial inclusion has had a significant contribution to this virtuous outcome It has been argued that as financial inclusion increases the ratio of output volatility to inflation volatility should also rise if the central bank cares about both and sets monetary policy to optimize their tradeoff In India this ratio has gone up from 06 in mid2015 to 13 in the last quarter of 202021 just before the pandemic struck In the pandemic period this ratio has shot up to above 5 but this is clearly an outlier which has to be tackled differently Looking ahead as financial inclusion rises even further in India consumption volatility as a source of output volatility can be expected to wane providing headroom for monetary policy to remain focused on minimising inflation volatility which brings welfare gains for all IV Monetary Policy Transmission Modern central banks mostly employ the interest rate to convey the stance of monetary policy to the rest of the economy Briefly put policy rate changes immediately influence shortterm money market rates from which they are transmitted through the continuum of financial markets to longerterm interest rates which impact spending decisions of businesses and households and eventually aggregate demand Financial inclusion is found to improve the transmission of interest ratebased monetary policy impulses in two ways First the financially excluded would typically prefer inside the pillow savings and for this cash is the preferred instrument As inclusion increases their preference shifts from cash to interestbearing bank deposits and other financial assets Consequently the interest sensitivity of financial savings in the economy goes up In view of compositional changes due to interestbearing deposits replacing currency in peoples portfolios the interest rate sensitivity of money balances also goes up Second financial inclusion is expected to expand the access to bank credit which is interest sensitive and affected by changes in the policy rate All in all financial inclusion enhances the potency of interestrate based monetary policy by causing an increasing number of people to become responsive to interest rate cycles In turn this prompts appropriate smoothing behaviour There is also some evidence to suggest that as interest rate sensitivity of the population increases central banks need to move interest rates by less to achieve their objectives In India the growing involvement of people in the monetary policy process has led to more democratic approaches to interest rate setting The RBI moved away from regulating interest rates during the 1990s This was followed by guidelinebased loan pricing norms prime lending rates base rates marginal cost of fundsbased lending rates The goal is transparency customer protection and awareness and being as marketbased as feasible all of which are intended to foster inclusiveness Across these regimes transmission of policy rate changes to both deposit and lending rates has improved The process has come full circle with the external benchmarkbased lending rates applied first to retail loans and credit to micro and small units under which transmission is even fuller Clearly sustaining the thrust on financial inclusion will leave the RBI better off in achieving monetary policy transmission V Expectations and Monetary Policy Credibility The role of expectations is crucial to the conduct of monetary policy Peoples expectations about the future are typically conditioned by the past For instance inflation expectations tell about the future course of prices as people see them in the rearview mirror For central banks such expectations are a crucial input for policy making because they can crystallise into actual outcomes if the number of people sharing the same expectations gains critical mass Furthermore central banks can assess whether expectations are anchored or not which has a bearing on their credibility Therefore what drives expectations is a question that is valuable for both people and the central banks that serve them It is observed that financial literacy empowers people to choose more relevant information and to make better use of it Closer assessment of future inflation helps inform choices on personal finance decisions including opening of a bank account taking a bank loan or even bargaining for wages India has recently stepped up its drive for financial inclusion to reach unserved and underserved sections of society The JAM trinity Jan Dhan Yojana Aadhaar Mobile is an internationally acclaimed gamechanger in this regard and is widely regarded as having completed inclusion on the deposit side During the pandemic the JAM trinity was leveraged to support and save livelihoods The NABARDs selfhelp group bank linkage programme has emerged as the worlds largest microfinance programme in terms of number of beneficiaries and microcredit extended The RBI has taken a number of outreach and public awareness campaigns for financial literacy the most visible being RBI Kehta Hai Interactive Voice Response System IVRS and these initiatives have spanned all types of media As these efforts intensify it is expected that an included and aware population will participate more in monetary policy formulation and implementation develop more rational expectations and induce financial intermediaries to transmit policy impulses more swiftly and effectively across the financial system VI Conclusion Monetary policy authorities typically avoid discussions on inequality They like to be seen in a macrostabilisation role and prefer leaving distributional issues to fiscal authorities Yet increasingly they realise that financial inclusion or the equality of access to formal finance impacts the conduct of monetary policy more fundamentally than they thought in the choice of metric for measuring goal variables in the choice of tradeoff between their variances and in the efficacy of monetary policy in reaching out to the broader economy It is in this context that central banks find themselves integrally involved in policy drives to expand financial inclusion because they have to take into account the true financial structures of the economies in which they conduct monetary policy As people get financially included they can use their access to formal finance to deal with both good and bad times and in more accurately assessing future inflation And this has monetary policy implications as I pointed out So central banks do care about inequality After all social welfare the mandate of institutions committed to the greater public good hinges on it Thank you References Anarfo E Abor J Y Osei K A and Gyekedako A 2019 Monetary

promoting financial education and literacy and making credit available to productive sectors of the economy including the rural and MSME sector 1 At the outset I would like to thank SaDhan for inviting me to deliver this inaugural address The theme for this year Revitalizing Financial Inclusion is an important issue at the current juncture The loss of livelihoods and hardships caused by the pandemic calls for a reinvigorated push towards financial inclusion and micro credit for vulnerable and disadvantaged sections of the society who have been worst affected by the pandemic There exists a strong case for using microfinance to transform social and economic structures and balance the welfare and profitability paradigm which I would like to cover in my address 2 As we all know microfinance has emerged as one of most important financial tools to foster financial inclusion It enables the poor and lowincome households to increase their income levels improve their overall standards of living and thereby come out of poverty It also has the potential to become a vehicle to achieve national policies that target poverty reduction women empowerment assistance to vulnerable groups and community development Evolutionary perspective 3 The notfor profit origin of microfinance was built on the idea that it was a social and welfare proposition driven by the objective of improving social welfare by increasing the household income through a communitybased approach While several micro finance models have evolved subsequently across the globe the search for delivering financial inclusion to the rural households and hinterlands has evolved through two distinct approaches for developing a micro finance model in India first the bank led approach mainly through Self Help Group SHG Bank Linkage Programme SHGBLP and the second one through the specialised micro finance institutions led model The recognition of and emphasis on micro finance at a larger scale and beginnings of a formalised structure of micro finance in India can be traced back to the SHG bank linkage programme SBLP which was started as a pilot project in 1992 by National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development NABARD This programme proved to be quite successful over the years An initiative which began as a simple approach of improving and deepening rural credit has slowly got transformed into an allinclusive programme for building financial and technological capabilities in rural India 4 Over time the bouquet of services under micro finance fold has expanded from only credit and thrift products to include micro insurance micro pension micro remittances digital payments amongst others This development suggests a recognition of the importance of other financial services and the industry orientation moving from lending to lowerincome groups to pursuing the double objectives of social benefits with financial viability Thus while serving the underprivileged microfinance also presents an opportunity for expanding the benefits of financial developments to those at the bottom of the pyramid 5 When microfinance activities gained prominence in the 1990s RBI recognized it as a new paradigm with immense potential and has been very supportive of its growth When the need for regulating the MFIs was felt in early 2000s a view was taken that MFIs are significantly different from other financial institutions both in terms of institutional structure and product portfolio and needed to be regulated differently Since then our approach has been to carve out a distinct regulatory regime for these institutions in alignment with the specific nuances of the sector without diluting the principles of prudence financial stability and customer interest 6 One key milestone in the evolution of this regulatory framework was the constitution of the committee under the Chairmanship of Shri Y H Malegam Based on the recommendations of this Committee RBI introduced a comprehensive regulatory framework for NBFCMFIs in December 2011 The regulations prescribed the eligibility criteria for microfinance loans which was linked to core features of microfinance ie lending of small amounts to borrowers belonging to lowincome groups without collateral with flexible repayment schedules Besides the regulations laid special emphasis on protection of borrowers and fair practices in lending such as transparency in charges ceilings on margins and interest rates noncoercive methods of recovery measures to contain multiple lending and overindebtedness 7 Indian microfinance sector has witnessed phenomenal growth over past two decades in terms of increase in both the number of institutions providing micro finance as also the quantum of credit made available to the micro finance customers Presently micro credit is delivered through a variety of institutional channels viz scheduled commercial banks SCBs regional rural banks RRBs cooperative banks nonbanking financial companies NBFCs Section 8 companies and microfinance institutions MFIs registered as NBFCs as well as in other forms 8 The small finance banks SFBs are the latest game in the town The institutional landscape of the microfinance sector has also changed significantly after licensing of Small Finance Banks One out of two entities which was granted approval for starting a universal bank in 2014 was an NBFCMFI while eight out of ten entities granted approval for starting Small Finance Banks in 2016 were NBFCMFIs This apart from further consolidation in the sector has led to significant changes in the market dynamics with the share of specialized MFIs standing at a little over 30 per cent as on June 30 2021 in the overall gross loan portfolio of around 214 lakh crore in the sector Thus micro finance as a financial activity can no longer said to be a bastion of specialized MFIs 9 However the current regulatory framework which was put in place with the objective of making credit available to lowincome households and to protect borrowers from harsh recovery practices of the lenders is applicable only to NBFCMFIs whereas other lenders who now have a share of around 70 per cent in the microfinance portfolio are not subjected to similar regulatory conditions This has created a nonlevel playing field posing difficulties for customers and has resulted in emergence of differing practices within the sector While one would have expected that other lenders would also be guided by the intent of the abovementioned regulations applicable to NBFC MFIs that has not happened 10 Mostly there have been three distinct sets of criticisms against micro finance lenders i that they lead their borrowers into debttrap like situations ii They charge usurious rates of interest often disproportionate to their funding and operational costs and iii they deploy harsh recovery methods leading to distress amongst borrowers These are issues which need to be critically introspected and addressed by the lenders to prevent recurrence of the crisis episodes 11 The emerging dynamics in the microfinance sector as well as the concerns around customer protection therefore call for a review of the regulations so that all the regulated entities engaged in micro finance pursue the goal of customer protection within a wellcalibrated and harmonized setup As you all may be aware the Reserve Bank has recently come out with the Consultative Document CD on Regulation of Microfinance seeking feedback from all the stakeholders I wish to highlight some of the major aspects we are trying to address through this proposed framework Overindebtedness and Multiple Lending 12 The protection of small borrowers has been enshrined in the NBFCMFI regulations which do not permit more than two NBFCMFIs to lend to the same borrower Besides there is a regulatory ceiling on the maximum amount that can be lent by an NBFCMFI to a microfinance borrower But it is observed that small borrowers are increasingly able to get multiple loans from several lenders well beyond their repayment capacity contributing to overindebtedness The borrowers then end up defaulting on their repayment obligations Then there are reports of coercive recovery practices by the entities looking to recover their dues In this entire process what we see is a compromise with the basic tenet of responsible lending with the small and marginal borrowers ending up becoming victims of overindebtedness 13 In the proposed framework it has therefore been suggested that the regulations should focus on repayment capacity of the borrowers rather than considering only indebtedness or indebtedness from only NBFCMFIs in isolation It has been proposed to address the issue of overindebtedness by prescribing a common definition of microfinance loans which will be uniformly applicable to all lenders and linking loan amount to household income The proposal is that the payment of interest and repayment of principal for all outstanding loans of the household at any point of time should not be more than 50 per cent of the household income Pricing of Micro finance Loans 14 Over the years modifications in the regulatory instructions and clarifications governing loan pricing for MFIs have evolved in sync with changing circumstances Following the recommendations of Malegam Committee the guidelines issued in December 2011 prescribed a uniform margin cap 12 per cent for smaller NBFCMFIs with portfolio of Rs 100 crore and less and 10 per cent for others along with a cap of 26 per cent on individual loans Later in 2012 the fixed interest rate ceiling of 26 per cent was removed while in April 2014 an additional criterion was introduced where in the lending rate was fixed at a multiple 275 times of the average base rate of five largest commercial banks 15 The regulatory ceiling on interest rate is applicable only to NBFCMFIs The prescription of a ceiling on lending rate for NBFCMFIs has had an unintended consequence of not allowing competition to play out There is a concern that the current guidelines while prescribing an interest rate ceiling for only NBFCMFIs are effectively acting as a benchmark for other lenders as well It is generally observed that interest rates of other lenders in micro finance segment also hover around this ceiling despite comparatively lower cost of funds Even among NBFCMFIs increasing size of the operations leading to greater economy of scale has not resulted in any perceptible decline in their lending rates As a result it is the borrowers who may be getting deprived of the benefits of enhanced competition monetary policy impulses as well as economies of scale 16 While banks including SFBs have been advised to benchmark all new floating rate personal or retail loans to an external benchmark wef October 1 2019 benchmarkbased pricing has not been introduced for NBFCs including NBFCMFIs yet In view of the substantial divergence between the financing and operational costs among the lenders operating in the micro finance space mandating any specific benchmark or any spread over a benchmark is unlikely to remove the constraints observed in the current system Therefore under the revised framework it is proposed to do away with the prescribed ceiling and mandate all lenders to have a board approved policy on allinclusive interest rate charged to the micro finance borrowers The lenders would also have to make available a simplified factsheet on pricing of micro finance loans to the borrowers along with the disclosure of minimum maximum and average interest rates charged by them The intention is to enable the market mechanism to come into play with the expectation that it will bring the lending rates downwards for the entire microfinance sector and empower the customer through transparent disclosures Customer Protection Measures 17 Now let me dwell briefly upon one other critical aspect of customer protection that the Reserve Bank is looking to strengthen through the proposed changes The inability difficulty of a borrower to repay his loan may be caused by several reasons such as unforeseen unavoidable adverse circumstances natural calamities overindebtedness etc A cap on the loan repayment obligation of a household as a percentage of the household income is expected to address the inability of the microfinance borrowers to repay the loan 18 Further in this case borrowers often lack the type of collateral preferred by the lenders and whatever little collateral they have for pledging may be of little value for the lenders even while it might be highly valued by the borrower Even if lenders take such collateral it is more for inducing repayments rather than to recover losses Therefore it has been proposed to extend the collateral free nature of microfinance loans as applicable to NBFCMFIs to all lenders in the micro finance space Way forward 19 I am sure everyone present here shares my concerns outlined above and appreciates the fact that negative consequences of overindebtedness harsh recovery practices and adverse outcomes arising from harassment of customers will adversely impact the MFI eco system From societys perspective there are economic and social implications While chasing higher asset growth and returns lenders should not throw caution to the winds Any slipup through adverse actions of the MFIs may undo the tremendous progress achieved over the decades and the Sector can illafford to do that 20 The roots and origin of micro finance should not be forgotten and sacrificed at the altar of bottomline growth There is no denying the fact that selfsufficiency and financial sustainability are the objectives that the lenders need to pursue However prioritization of profitability at the expense of social and welfare goals of the micro finance may not be an optimal outcome Lenders need to remain cognizant of the fact that the balance sheet growth should not be built by compromising on the prudent conduct 21 Micro finance in my view at its core should focus on understanding the needs of the customer first and offer them adequate levels of support through appropriate financial products The customers of micro finance institutions often have lower level of financial awareness and literacy and are often too desperate to turn away any source of credit Therefore they need to be treated with care and empathy and should not be considered as a mere data points for investor presentations The lenders in the micro finance space should not try to mimic the strategies of mainstream finance as those serving the micro borrowers have a greater need to balance the social objectives with their lending operations Strong corporate governance could play a critical role in balancing seemingly exclusive but potentially complementary objectives of growth and social welfare from a longterm perspective 22 As microfinance industry serves lower strata of the society and micro and small businesses it has its own set of operational challenges and costs Technology should help the industry to overcome this challenge Microfinance lenders who are early adopters of technology are using customer data for designing tailored financial products automating the processes for customer onboarding improving the credit monitoring process by getting early warning signs of stress in loan portfolio and enabling digital modes of loan and other payments A few entities are designing apps that are vernacular and aid customer interaction through voice and chat conversations thereby making them customer friendly intuitive and easy to use Technology is thus serving to counter the key issues of high operating cost credit risk and customer service 23 The local connect and communityoriented approach through physical interaction has been the hallmark of micro finance sector However in the digital era many micro finance lenders are also entering into partnership with fintech firms for delivery of services and sourcing of customers While we encourage the use of technology let me reiterate that the customer protection should not be compromised in the process and customer should get the similar experience in digital mode if not better The other areas of immediate focus for the sector include revamping of the risk management systems improving the skills of the field level staff and institution of an effective grievance redressal system Concluding thoughts 24 For most of us it is hard to imagine a life without financial services but billions of people around the world do not have to imagine it but live through it every day Unless we work to uplift this vast section of the society by bringing them into the formal financial fold a billion aspirations may remain unfulfilled Micro finance has come of age in India It has developed into an important financial delivery mechanism It has particularly helped women to become owners of assets have an increased say in decision making and lead dignified lives In current landscape it is possible to expedite financial inclusion process by leveraging the flexibility provided by the multiple techled models for delivering a wide range of financial services I am confident that the conference will throw up ideas which will enable the vibrant growth of the industry while managing the challenges and addressing some of the key concerns which I have tried to highlight From the regulatory side we would look to foster the growth of the sector guided by the ultimate objective of financial inclusion and customer protection while providing a level playing field 25 Let me conclude by wishing you all a very productive set of discussions over the course of the conference Thank you 1 Inaugural Address by Shri M Rajeshwar Rao Deputy Governor Reserve Bank of India October 27 2021 at SaDhan National Conference on Revitalizing Financial Inclusion Assistance provided by Dr Nitin Jain Shri Pradeep Kumar Shri Peshimam Khabeer Ahmed and Shri Anuj Sharma is thankfully acknowledged
https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1110&fn=2754,Date Financial Inclusion Past Present and Future,This role encapsulates the essence of renewed national focus on Financial Inclusion promoting financial education and literacy and making credit available to productive sectors of the economy including the rural and MSME sector I wish to thank the organisers of the Economic Times Financial Inclusion Summit for inviting me to address this august gathering Financial inclusion is a key driver of sustained and balanced economic growth which helps reduce income inequality and poverty While we have made tremendous strides in this area over the years the pandemic has created new challenges and complexities The financial system will have a crucial role to fulfil the aspirations and needs of our economy on the mend It is therefore befitting that a summit to deliberate on financial inclusion is being organised at this juncture and I commend the organisers for the same 2 The overarching principle behind Indias journey towards financial inclusion is echoed in the Gandhian philosophy Sarvodaya through Antyodaya Welfare of all through the upliftment of the weakest The focus is on the basic objectives of inclusiveness and equity which go beyond poverty alleviation It also encompasses equality of opportunity for all sections of society including the poor women farmers small enterprises and others The policy makers in India Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India acknowledged the importance of financial inclusion early and have taken a number of measures to ensure that the benefits of economic growth percolate down to the poor and excluded sections of the society 3 I am sure this forum today will deliberate on the emerging risks new models of innovative and disruptive technologies and areas of possible policy interventions In my address today I thought it may be apt to look at how far we have travelled on the path of financial inclusion and dwell upon the way ahead While assessing the progress made in this sphere across the dimensions of Access Usage and Quality it is observed that India has come a long way in facilitating access to banking services to the last mile and in increasing the usage of financial products Taking this forward the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion 20192024 NSFI1 and National Strategy for Financial Education 202020252 NSFE provide a road map for a coordinated approach towards financial inclusion financial literacy and consumer protection The National Strategy for Financial Inclusion document lays down several milestones and action plans to be implemented in order to make financial services available accessible and affordable to all citizens in a safe and transparent manner to support inclusive growth through a multistakeholder approach Developments so far 4 Financial Inclusion journey of the country can be traced back to the 1950s when the focus was on channelizing of credit to the neglected sectors of the economy and weaker sections of the population This was followed by various initiatives over the years such as expansion of branch network introduction of Priority Sector LendingPSL launch of Lead Bank Scheme promotion of Self Help GroupsSHGs Joint Liability Groups JLGs implementation of Business Correspondents BC model among others The brick and mortar branches complemented by the BC model have improved the reach of the banking system across the country The spread and reach of financial inclusion has indeed been exponential in recent years 5 The evolution and adoption of technology has led to massive improvement in deepening of digital financial services The Jan Dhan Aadhaar and Mobile JAM eco system has brought about a major shift in the universe of financial inclusion Further several initiatives have been taken for the creation of enabling digital infrastructure at the ground level so as to universalise digital payments in a convenient safe secure and affordable manner Given the latent potential of harnessing value at the bottom of the pyramid we have seen a plethora of players emerging in the field ranging from traditional banks niche financial entities such as payments banks small finance banks micro finance institutions MFIs and promising fintech companies 6 In order to have a planned and structured approach to financial inclusion banks have been advised by RBI to put in place financial inclusion plans FIPs consisting of achievements against several parameters3 Substantial progress has been made with respect to these parameters details of which are given in the Reserve Banks Annual Report released in May 2021 7 Greater focus is now being given to addressing the vulnerable segments of the economy and population while paying attention to consumer protection and enhancing capacity of customers so that responsible and sustainable use of financial services can be achieved The introduction of differentiated banks catering to the unique needs of varied population groups was a step in that direction In the recent past the challenges that have engaged our attention are i how to identify the customer ii how to reach the last mile and iii how to provide relevant products which are affordable and safe catering to diverse needs 8 The digital ID Aadhaar along with the proliferation of mobile phones with world class payment systems have addressed the first two challenges of access and usage to a large extent The third challenge ie quality requires both demand and supply side interventions Opening of Pradhan Mantri JanDhan Yojana PMJDY accounts has enabled millions of Indians to have access to financial services with a basic bouquet of financial products This has addressed the supply side issue to a considerable extent The demand side interventions focused on creating awareness amongst the public Financial literacy customer protection and grievance redressal have become areas of focus for furthering sustainable financial inclusion Setting up of National Centre for Financial Education NCFE by the Regulators and implementation of the Centre for Financial Literacy CFL project of RBI are two recent initiatives towards improving financial literacy 9 Payment systems are seen to be lifeline of an economy They are increasingly being recognised as a means of achieving financial inclusion and ensuring that economic benefits reach the bottom of the pyramid It is quite well known by now that India is among the leaders in the world with regard to development of stateoftheart payment infrastructure and products leading to a wider adoption of digital payments To give an example the number of Prepaid Payment Instruments PPI4 increased at a compounded annual growth rate CAGR of 53 per cent from 41 crore in May 2017 to 226 crore in May 2021 The trends indicate that such instruments have become immensely popular for making small value payments 10 The movement towards digital payments has also been facilitated by the introduction of fast payment systems such as Immediate Payment Service IMPS and Unified Payment Interface UPI which provide immediate credit to beneficiaries and are available round the clock The extent of digital penetration can be gauged from the fact that each day on an average during June 2021 the payment systems in India processed more than 15 crore transactions amounting to nearly 45 lakh crore per day The UPI platform facilitating payment transactions through smartphones has revolutionised the payment landscape in India UPI has witnessed over 280 crore transactions in June 2021 Globally there has been lot of interest in UPI Similarly the Aadhaar enabled Payments System AePS facilitates fund transferspayments and cash withdrawals through microATMs and BCs using Aadhaar authentication During the pandemic cash transactions at BC outlets through microATMs have witnessed significant surge with more than 94 crore transactions accounting for 225 lakh crore5 during 202021 Response to the Pandemic 11 In India the second wave of the pandemic has taken a grievous toll both in terms of lives and livelihood The recovery that had commenced in the second half of 202021 was dented by the second wave of the pandemic in AprilMay 2021 Our efforts towards financial inclusion have helped in enabling the Government to provide seamless and timely financial support to vulnerable sections through direct benefit transfers DBT 12 One of the important components of the JAM trinity Aadhaar the worlds largest initiative to provide biometric identity has facilitated financial inclusion through innovative digital platforms The NACHAadhaar Payments Bridge APB System and PMJDY together have been instrumental in enabling an effective usage of available banking facilities which came to the fore during the pandemic with cash benefits under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana being disbursed to these accounts As on date there are about 4259 crore6 PMJDY account holders with more than 55 per cent account holders being women The impact of the digital payment in DBT can be discerned from the fact that 553 lakh crore was transferred digitally across 319 government schemes spread over 54 ministries during 202021 13 To mitigate the financial impact of COVID19 related disruptions the Reserve Bank has taken several policy measures to ease flow of credit at a lower cost to needy segments These measures include lowering of policy rate launching of ontap liquidity schemes and channelising of liquidity through All India Financial Institutions and facilitating financial institutions to resolve stressed loans to individuals small business and MSMEs Cash Reserve Ratio CRR exemption on credit disbursements to new MSME borrowers PSL classification for bank loans to NBFCs for onlending and PSL classification for loans from small finance banks SFBs to micro finance institutions MFIs for onlending were additional measures taken to promote credit flow to affected sectors Further with an objective to provide more focus on inclusive development the Reserve Bank last year broadened the scope of PSL by a including startups b enhanced the limits for lending to renewable energy sector c increased the targets for small and marginal farmers and weaker sections and d incentivised banks to augment credit flows to districts with relatively lower credit penetration 14 The pandemic has accelerated the push towards digitalisation with greater adoption of digital payments It is important to take steps to converge greater digitalisation with goals of financial inclusion Operationalisation of Payment Infrastructure Development Fund PIDF an initiative of RBI together with banks and card networks will provide the necessary impetus for development of payment acceptance infrastructure in tier3 to tier6 centres and north eastern states This will facilitate greater deployment of electronic payment acceptance facilities for example point of sale devices in hitherto untapped areas thereby furthering the reach of digital payments ecosystem 15 Similarly the Reserve Banks pilot project in association with banks of making at least one district in each StateUT 100 per cent digitally enabled which was rolled out in 2019 covering 42 districts will facilitate greater access and usage of digital payments by the common man As on March 2021 banks have achieved a digital coverage7 of 959 per cent of individuals while the achievement for businesses stood at 898 per cent The SLBCs have been advised to give renewed focus and emphasis to ensure sustenance of the digital progress in these identified districts Further in order to promote universal access to financial services under the NSFI access to some form of banking outlet has been provided to 999 per cent of the targeted villages within a 5 KM radius hamlets with 500 households in hilly areas 16 The pandemic related restrictions on mass gathering of people at various public places has necessitated a relook at conventional financial literacy camps During the pandemic period enhanced recourse to alternative approaches like using social media mass media including local TV channels and radio was undertaken across the country to continue dissemination of financial education Post Pandemic World The Way Forward 17 In order to make the postpandemic recovery more inclusive and sustainable financial inclusion would continue to be our policy priority Considering the complementary role played by microfinance in bridging the gaps at the last mile a consultative document for harmonising the regulatory frameworks for various regulated lenders in the microfinance space has been issued recently The primary objective is to address the concerns relating to overindebtedness of microfinance borrowers enable market mechanism to rationalise the interest rates and empower the borrowers to make an informed decision by enhancing transparency of loan pricing 18 The scaling up of Centre for Financial Literacy CFL project across the country at the block level by March 2024 is expected to enhance the effectiveness of communityled participatory approaches for greater financial literacy Further recognising the importance of inculcating financial literacy concepts at a young age one of the strategic goals of the National Strategy for Financial Education 20202025 NSFE is integrating financial literacy content in the curriculum for school children So far 15 state educational boards have included modules on financial education in their school curriculum These approaches are expected to strengthen financial education at the grassroots level so as to realise the vision of creating a financially aware and empowered India as enunciated in the NSFE 19 To measure the extent of financial inclusion in the country it has been decided to construct and periodically publish a Financial Inclusion Index FI Index The Index will have parameters across the three dimensions of financial inclusion viz Access Usage and Quality Work on FI Index is underway and the Index will be published shortly by the RBI Conclusion 20 As I conclude I would like to reiterate that financial inclusion promotes inclusive growth by way of making financial services including credit and other safety nets available to the bottom of the pyramid Lessons from the past and experiences gained during the COVID19 pandemic clearly indicate that financial inclusion and inclusive growth reinforce financial stability Greater financial literacy and education together with sound consumer protection mechanisms will ensure that people at the bottom of the pyramid are empowered to take informed financial decisions This will also enable banks NBFCs MFIs etc to enhance their customer base and products and diversify their balance sheet 21 I would like to emphasise that we must continue our efforts for greater financial inclusion in pursuance of the goal of sustainable future for all There is need for accelerated universal reach of bank accounts along with access to financial products relating to credit investment insurance and pension It is the responsibility of all stakeholders to ensure that the financial ecosystem including the digital medium is inclusive and capable of effectively addressing risks like misselling cyber security data privacy and promoting trust in the financial system through appropriate financial education and awareness These efforts have to be supported by a robust grievance redressal mechanism I look forward to interesting ideas and thoughts emanating from this forum which would enhance the process of financial inclusion in the country Thank you Namskar 1

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1095&fn=2754,Date Micro Small and Medium Enterprises Challenges and Way Forward,This role encapsulates the essence of renewed national focus on Financial Inclusion promoting financial education and literacy and making credit available to productive sectors of the economy including the rural and MSME sector At the outset I wish to thank ASSOCHAM for inviting me to their 15th Annual Banking Summit More so because this is ASSOCHAMs centenary year It is a remarkable accomplishment and I extend warm greetings to all those associated with ASSOCHAM Over the years ASSOCHAM has transformed itself into a forceful proactive forwardlooking organisation to meet the aspirations of Indian business I am certain that ASSOCHAMs journey towards excellence will continue 2 In a country like India with a population size of about 13 billion the Micro Small and Medium Enterprises MSME sector has a vital role in the economy It fosters entrepreneurship and generates large employment opportunities As MSMEs absorb the surplus agricultural labour they help reduce the problem of disguised unemployment in rural areas MSMEs are also complementary to large industries as ancillary units and also play an important role in the whole ecosystem of the secondary and tertiary sector 3 We all are aware that the MSME sector is passing through a challenging phase The theme of todays Summit Structural Reforms in MSME Funding chosen by ASSOCHAM therefore could not be more apt and timely In my address today I would begin by underlining the importance of the MSMEs to the economy I would then delve into some challenges faced by them and discuss some of the measures undertaken by the Reserve Bank I shall also list out some issues as a way forward I Importance to the Economy 4 Let me begin by highlighting a few stylised facts on the contribution of MSME sector in India The MSME sector contributes in a significant way to the growth of the Indian economy with a vast network of about 63 crore units and a share of around 30 per cent in nominal GDP in 2016171 The share of the sector in total manufacturing output was even higher at 45 per cent2 Taking cognisance of the wider set of benefits that the sector offers to the rest of the economy the Government has envisioned to increase its contribution to GDP to over 50 per cent in next few years as the country aspires for a 5 trillion economy3 5 As per the 73rd round of National Sample Survey NSS conducted during the period 201516 the estimated employment in MSME sector was around 11 crore Within MSME sector each of the three subsectors namely trade manufacturing and other services accounted for about a third of total employment Around 50 per cent of the total MSMEs operate in rural areas and provide 45 per cent of total employment Interestingly the micro enterprises account for 97 per cent of total employment in MSME sector4 This relates to the problem of what is called the missing middle5 which suggests that micro firms have failed to grow into smaller and medium firms and so on over time This seems to have kept the micro sector bereft of enjoying economies of scale investment into fixed assets adoption of technology and innovation 6 The share of MSME sector in Indias merchandise exports stood at around 48 per cent in 2018196 This signifies that Indian MSMEs are becoming globally competitive and their productsservices are being accepted overseas In this background special attention needs to be given to improve the competitiveness and technology upgradation endeavours Various schemes and programmes of the Government therefore should be continued and effectively implemented II Challenges in the MSME sector 7 Despite the MSME sector contributing significantly to the economy it continues to face several challenges The major challenges include physical infrastructure bottlenecks absence of formalisation inertia to technology adoption capacity building backward and forward linkages lack of access to credit and risk capital and the perennial problem of delayed payments among others Let me now elaborate on some of these issues Infrastructure bottlenecks and Competition 8 Notwithstanding various efforts to upgrade the infrastructure the MSME clusters particularly the micro enterprises are inadequately equipped with necessary support systems which not only impede their daytoday business operations but also their future growth prospects While infrastructure constraint is only one side of the story I believe that MSMEs also need to do their bit to improve competitiveness They need to shed their inhibition to adopt new technologies accept epayments and foster inhouse innovation which will help them manage their businesses digitally and compete globally Given the current scenario of global trade the ageold methods of operating business with low levels of technology adoption deprives them of potential economies of scale Lack of expertise in product development designing packaging and marketing strategy due to their small size add up to the pressure of adapting to the changing environment around them The strategy for MSMEs should be to gradually expand in size and reduce the dependence on the incentive structure provided by the Government Their aim should be eventually to compete on a global scale Access to Credit and Formalisation 9 Credit plays a vital role in development of MSME sector as funds at a reasonable cost can increase their competitiveness Credit disbursal to this sector has however remained sluggish in recent periods At an aggregate level the total credit outstanding from banks and NBFCs to the MSME sector was approximately 166 lakh crore as at end of September 2019 Scheduled commercial banks account for 90 per cent of the share of total credit outstanding 10 As many MSMEs mainly operate in the informal space assessing their creditworthiness can be difficult due to information asymmetry particularly with respect to the financial performance of their businesses In the absence of collateral underwriting the customer often entails higher operating cost Furthermore due to their smallscale operations MSMEs are not able to raise risk capital They are also unable to take advantage of most of the Government schemes which are mostly based on digital infrastructure and require beneficiaries to have some form of digital identify and presence With the implementation of structural reforms like GST and JAM trinity the informal units are however getting integrated with the mainstream in recent years Delayed Payments 11 A large number of MSMEs are ancillary units catering to the needs of large industries both in the public and private sector They often face the problem of delayed payments affecting their cash flow and working capital availability Most of the time delay in realisation of such receivables increases their operating cycle and reduces their ability to procure new orders or fulfil the existing ones A primary survey conducted by Reserve Bank in December 2019 showed that 44 per cent of MSMEs engaged in manufacturing activities faced delay in payments The ones not receiving timely payment mainly belonged to basic metal and metal products engineering construction and infrastructure related industries On the other hand delay in payments was lower at 27 per cent for services sector Here transport operators mostly faced such situations Although Micro Small and Medium Enterprises Development MSMED Act 2006 contains provisions related to penalty in case of delayed payments by the buyers weak bargaining power and the fear of losing the business prevents MSMEs to invoke this provision III Expert Committee on MSMEs 12 In order to understand the structural bottlenecks and factors affecting the performance of the MSMEs RBI had set up an Expert Committee on MSMEs under the Chairmanship of Shri UK Sinha in January 2019 The Committee has undertaken comprehensive review of the sector and given several recommendations for the economic and financial sustainability of the MSME sector These recommendations are wideranging and broadly relate to legislative changes infrastructure development capacity building technological upgradation improving backward and forward linkages improving financial support from formal sources newer technological interventions for robust underwriting practices and credit delivery among others While some of the recommendations of the Committee have already been implemented others are under consideration by the authorities concerned IV Measures Undertaken by RBI Measures to Improve the Credit Flow 13 The Reserve Bank has taken several measures in the recent period to improve the flow of credit to the MSME sector Banks form the predominant source of formal credit to MSMEs with all such loans by banks qualifying for Priority Sector Lending classification In August 2019 we have further incentivised banks to lend to MSMEs through the NBFC sector Consequently bank credit to registered NBFCs other than Micro Finance Institutions for onlending to micro and small enterprises up to 20 lakh per borrower are eligible for classification as priority sector lending 14 A scheme of onetime restructuring without an asset classification downgrade was permitted to GST registered MSME accounts that were in default but standard as on January 1 2019 As the process of formalisation of the MSME sector has a positive impact on financial stability and this process is still underway the scheme has been extended to accounts that are standard but in default as on January 1 2020 and restructuring wherever eligible has to be implemented latest by December 31 2020 This will enhance the scope of the scheme by benefitting the eligible MSME entities which could not be restructured under the provisions of the circular dated January 1 2019 as also the MSME entities which have become stressed thereafter So far banks have restructured 6 lakh accounts out of 15 lakh eligible accounts under the scheme Our primary survey suggested lack of awareness about the scheme among the MSMEs 15 We have announced last month that incremental loans to MSMEs along with retail loans for automobiles and residential housing will be exempted from CRR from fortnight ending January 31 2020 up to fortnight ending July 31 2020 16 Subsequent to the introduction of an external benchmark system in October 2019 the monetary policy transmission has improved where new floating rate loans to the micro and small entrepreneurs were linked to the external benchmark With a view to further strengthening monetary policy transmission all new floating rate loans to medium enterprises extended by banks from April 01 2020 will also be linked to the external benchmarks Addressing Delayed Payments 17 As I have mentioned earlier delay in getting payments is one the perennial problems faced by MSMEs To address this issue the Reserve Bank introduced the Trade Receivables Discounting System TReDS in 2014 TReDS is an electronic platform where receivables of MSMEs drawn against buyers large corporates PSUs Government departments are financed through multiple financiers at competitive rates This is done through an auctionbased mechanism To widen the scope of TReDS and to incentivise more players to be part of this platform banks exposure through this platform were brought under priority sector lending in 2016 Presently three entities viz Receivables Exchange of India Ltd RXIL A TReDS and Mynd Solutions licensed by the Reserve Bank are operating the platform for more than two years Further the Reserve Bank recently allowed on tap authorization to entities desirous to provide platforms for TReDS Hence in coming years competition in receivables discounting space is bound to increase with the entry of new players This requires the corporates both in the public and private sector to join the TReDS platform and make the system more efficient 18 In 2018 the Government made it mandatory for all companies with a turnover greater than 500 crores to register with TReDS As on February 2020 while 8211 MSME sellers were registered while only 1530 buyers were participating on the platforms I would appeal to the ASSOCHAM to encourage and handhold all its members to participate in the TReDS platform 19 In the Union Budget 202021 the Government has announced appbased invoice financing products to obviate the problem of delayed payments of MSME The mechanism may prove complementary to the TReDS platform and would further alleviate the problem of delayed payments V Way forward 20 As the MSME sector holds immense potential the need is to have a right set of policies and enabling framework which guide and support MSMEs to effectively handle their existing problems and venture into new areas While both the Government and the RBI have introduced a plethora of measures for improving access to finance and to promote growth of the sector the small size of individual units and informal nature of the sector continue to pose challenges 21 The traditional bank lending system by banks is based on financial statements and collateral of the borrower With increased availability of data from several sources including GSTN income tax credit bureaus etc it is now possible to appraise the MSME loan proposals expeditiously by doing due diligence online Further with the help of Account Aggregators AA lenders will have access to potential borrowers financial information at a single point of course with hisher consent Furthermore emergence of FinTech companies has made it possible to assess credit worthiness of MSMEs by utilising unexplored data sources such as digital transaction trails data generated through ecommerce sites etc Some lenders are collaborating with FinTech companies to take advantage of such surrogate data for speedier credit underwriting for extending loans to MSME sector These new architectures would expand the reach of credit 22 While the new models are beneficial for those units which are digitally active a large segment of MSME units access credit through traditional lending models While micro enterprises act as a starting stage of entrepreneurship that requires low investment in technology units graduating to small and medium enterprises have to enhance their technical capacity and explore newer markets in order to stay competitive for sustainable growth Recent policy efforts will provide an enabling environment and facilitate the MSME sector seize the new emerging opportunities I must add that as a regulator we in RBI have to safeguard financial stability while ensuring wider access to finance Banks and other players on their part have to ensure prudent lending 23 Besides we in RBI have started launching cohorts under the Regulatory Sandbox First such cohort was launched in November 2019 with the theme of Retail Payments to spur innovation in digital payments space to design and test newer payment services for the unserved and underserved segments In due course we propose to run a regulatory sandbox for cohorts focussed on lending This would promote innovation in MSME lending segment The project on Public Credit Registry PCR will fundamentally address the information asymmetry that impedes access to credit for micro and small entrepreneurs The PCR has been envisaged as a database of core credit information The registry would play crucial role in reducing credit gap in the segment 24 Given the fact that the MSME sector contributes significantly to exports it is essential that they should be integrated with global value chains GVC to remain competitive as it offers unique opportunity to become technologically and digitally empowered Being part of GVC would enable MSMEs to produce quality goods and services which will have greater acceptability in the global market The major challenges for the sector to connect to the GVC are lack of information knowledge of markets and quality standards In this regard I see a greater role for cooperation among all stakeholders 25 Let me conclude by reiterating that industry bodies like the ASSOCHAM will need to extend their role and assist MSMEs embrace best business practices in line with the fastchanging business environment I wish this summit of ASSOCHAM all success in its centenary year Thank You 1 Annual Report Ministry of MSME 201819 2 Report of the Expert Committee on Micro Small and Medium

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1089&fn=2754,Date Rural and Agriculture Finance Critical Input to Achieve Inclusive and Sustainable Development,This role encapsulates the essence of renewed national focus on Financial Inclusion promoting financial education and literacy and making credit available to productive sectors of the economy including the rural and MSME sector 1 Mr Senarath Bandara Chairman APRACA Asia Pacific Rural and Agricultural Credit Association Dr Harsh Kumar Bhanwala Chairman National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development NABARD and ViceChairman APRACA Dr Prasun Kumar Das Secretary General APRACA all other dignitaries present here ladies and gentlemen good afternoon 2 At the outset I would like to thank APRACA and NABARD for inviting me to give the valedictory address to the participants visiting from different countries here at the 6th World Congress I would like to congratulate the organisers for having chosen the theme ie Rural and Agriculture Finance Critical Input to Achieve Inclusive and Sustainable Development with the aim of getting insights into the global best approaches to rural and agricultural finance The topics of the business sessions are befitting the overarching objective of this forum for deliberating on policy priorities in developing sustainable and viable financial services to support and help in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs of the United Nations Needless to say all the topics resonate strongly with the development agenda of the Government and financial inclusion strategy of the Reserve Bank of India RBI We have been pursuing the goal of financial inclusion for a long time to ensure that access to formal finance becomes a greater enabler to achieve economic wellbeing of all sections of the economy It is indeed a great pleasure for me to share my views on this subject 3 The RBIs financial inclusion efforts can be traced back to the 1960s when the focus was on channelizing of credit to the neglected sectors of the economy and weaker sections of the population While the Government of India nationalized banking operations of few commercial banks in two tranches in 1969 and 1980 RBI took initiatives like laying down priority sector lending requirements for banks formulation of the Lead Bank Scheme establishment of Regional Rural Banks RRBs197576 Service Area Approach 1989 SelfHelp GroupBank Linkage Programme 198990 setting up of Local Area Banks and of late Small Finance Banks and Payment Banks all aimed at making available banking services to all All these developments brought in a sea change in the flow of institutional credit to the rural population including population dependant on agriculture Gradually the country moved towards a multiagency approach to meet the credit needs of the rural areas including farmers 4 I am sure all distinguished panellists international and local participants and the organisers have had fruitful discussions and deliberations during the last two days and have been able to draw upon actionable points for formulating strategies and the way forward Sustainable Development Goals 5 The sustainable development framework adopted by the global community consists of 17 SDGs and 169 targets to be achieved by 2030 While Goal 2 of the SDGs includes targets on agricultural productivity and sustainability yet agriculture is also critical to achieve many other SDGs relating to hunger malnutrition climate change gender equality natural resources protection and jobs Hence to attain the SDGs of ending poverty and bringing in inclusive growth policy measures related to agriculture need to be closely integrated with the SDG targets Further the policies should focus on a combination of resource efficient methods dynamic cropping patterns farming that is adaptive and responsive to climate change and intensive use of Information Communication Technology ICT Against this backdrop let me dwell upon the Indian agriculture sector and the existing institutional framework for providing credit to the farming community A brief on Indian Agriculture 6 Agriculture plays a significant role in the Indian economy and provides employment and livelihood to a large section of the Indian population Approximately 44 as per ILO estimate of 2018 of the working population is employed in agriculture and allied sector1 However the contribution of agriculture to GDP has been declining from 52 in the 1950s to 30 in the 1990s and further below 20 from 2010 onwards as per data from Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation MoSPI2 In 201819 the share of Agriculture Allied Gross Value Added GVA in overall GVA was 16 Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare MoAFW Annual Report 201819 Economic Survey 201819 suggests that the growth rate in GVA at 201112 prices over past fivesix years has been higher for livestocks fishing and aquaculture as compared to crops3 Allied activities contribute approximately 40 to agricultural output whereas only 67 of agricultural credit flows towards allied activities4 One important characteristic of Indian agriculture is that it is mainly small holders farming with an average landholding size of 108 hectares5 The small and marginal farmers account for 86 per cent of all holdings and 47 percent of the operated area6 They contribute more than 50 of the total agricultural and allied output In smallholder farming it remains a challenge to raise agricultural productivity and farmers incomes It requires appropriate solutions starting with easy access to modern inputs and then selling the produce in most remunerative markets Institutional credit at reasonable cost all along the value chain is one such catalytic instrument that can facilitate the process by converting many subsistence farmers into vibrant commercial farmers They can then diversify their agricultural operations in growing high value crops like fruits and vegetables and engage in allied activities like dairy poultry fishery honey beekeeping etc Allied has huge potential which can be capitalised by improving credit flow towards it and by encouraging farmers to move towards allied activities 7 From time to time Government has given various policy thrusts as a result of which the Indian agriculture sector has not only become selfsufficient but has emerged as a net exporter of several commodities like rice marine products cotton etc Some of the important initiatives taken by the Government include the implementation of Interest Subvention Scheme ISS for providing credit for crop production at reduced interest rate Soil Health Cards SHC for improving agricultural productivity Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana PMKSY to ensure irrigation facilities Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana PMFBY for providing a safety net against natural calamities and National Agriculture Market Scheme eNAM for providing better price discovery through transparent auction process There is also a renewed focus on allied activities to aid income of farmers 8 Despite these initiatives there are several challenges confronting Indian agriculture such as diminishing and degrading natural resources rapidly growing demand for food not just for quantity but also for quality stagnating farm incomes fragmented land holdings and unprecedented climate change which need to be tackled for long term sustainability and viability of Indian agriculture What has been the role of institutional credit in Indian agriculture 9 Banks in India have made commendable progress in terms of scale and outreach of formal credit to the agriculture sector From 3171 billion in 1981 the outstanding advances to agriculture and allied activities have grown significantly to 1369456 billion in 201718 16 per cent of total bank credit The longterm trend in institutional agricultural credit revealed that over time significant progress has been achieved in terms of scale Agricultural credit as a percentage to Agriculture GDP increased from 10 in 1970s to 52 by 2018 which shows that banks have made significant progress in lending to agriculture In India scheduled commercial banks 79 are the major players in supplying credit to agriculture sector followed by rural cooperative banks 15 regional rural banks 5 and micro finance institutions 1 Small finance banks set up with the objective of deepening financial inclusion have started their operations recently They would be catering to small and marginal farmers low income households small businesses and other unorganised entities Challenges in agriculture financing 10 Despite the impressive growth in formal agricultural credit there are still several challenges that need to be tackled Data on the average loan taken by agricultural households as per the NABARDs Financial Inclusion Survey Report 201617 indicated that 72 of the credit requirement was met from institutional sources and 28 from noninstitutional sources The report further states that out of the total agricultural households approximately 30 percent still avail credit from noninstitutional sources The problem of financial exclusion gets aggravated due to lack of legal framework for landless cultivators as the absence of documentary evidence becomes a major hindrance for extending credit to this segment of the farming community who take up cultivation work on oral lease Further the analysis of state wise flow of institutional agricultural credit has revealed uneven distribution of credit amongst states compared to their corresponding share in overall output To a certain extent such regional disparity is on account of variation in credit absorption capacity of these regions Funds like Rural Infrastructure Development Fund RIDF have been created out of priority sector lending shortfall of banks and established with NABARD with the underlying philosophy of lending to state governments to facilitate creation of enabling rural infrastructure to deepen the credit absorption capacity in rural areas 11 An analysis of sanctions from RIDF indicates that states with higher credit flow made higher demands for resources under the fund On the contrary states with lower credit flow were lagging in borrowing funds from RIDF Thus the least developed states which are already credit starved are getting lower share of funds from the RIDF This highlights the need to break this vicious cycle and think of certain measures by which funds can be earmarked to the most backward credit starved regions to ensure speedier development of the most backward areas in the country We may also have to think of ways to incentivise banks to lend in these backward areas so that both demand and supply side issues are addressed These issues and challenges impinge on the efficiency inclusiveness and sustainability of the agricultural credit system which is a matter of concern Internal Working Group set up by RBI 12 Considering this RBI had set up an Internal Working Group IWG in February 2019 to understand the issues and recommend workable solutions to address the constraints The IWG based on extensive data analysis and research held extensive consultations and deliberations with experts and practitioners in the field and submitted its report in September 2019 13 The recommendations of the IWG include building up of an enabling ecosystem through digitisation of land records reforming of land leasing framework creation of a national level agency to build consensus among the state governments and central government with regard to agriculturerelated policy reforms and innovative digital solutions to bridge the information gap between the banks and farmers for expediting the credit delivery process Other policy interventions recommended are suitable modifications in the Priority Sector Lending guidelines applicable to all banks and strengthening of credit delivery channels through Kisan Credit Cards SelfHelp Group Bank Linkage Programme Farmer Producers Organisations in a manner to make them more effective and efficient in ensuring credit flow to the credit starved regions of the country as also to the excluded segments of the farming community RBI would be initiating necessary steps for implementing these recommendations as these would go a long way in ensuring the longterm sustainability and viability of the Indian agriculture sector Financial Inclusion 14 Financial Inclusion FI is a policy thrust area for RBI and as a result of the various initiatives tremendous progress has been made in the domain of financial inclusion since the country set out in mission mode about 10 years ago Further with the launch of Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana PMJDY almost every household has been brought under the fold of formal financial system Both in terms of deposit accounts and credit products there has been a steady improvement over the years RBI has initiated setting up a National Strategy for Financial Inclusion with the objective of making financial products and services available accessible and affordable to all citizens in a safe and transparent manner to support inclusive and resilient multistakeholder led growth The strategic pillars of the financial inclusion strategy would include universal access to financial services providing basic bouquet of financial services access to livelihood and skill development financial literacy and education customer protection and grievance redressal The FI strategy aims for sustainable financial inclusion by leveraging technology and adopting a multistakeholder approach 15 The key highlights of the FI strategy is enhancing digital infrastructure in the country through better networking of bank branches Business Correspondent agents Micro ATMs PoS terminals and Internet connectivity facilitating a move towards digital onboarding of customers This would encourage adoption and acceptance of digital payments and promote efficiency and transparency through digital transactions The strategy adopted has a customer centric approach accompanied by appropriate efforts towards financial literacy and awareness drive Finally for building of trust and confidence of the new entrants to the formal financial system the strategy focusses on customer grievance and protection framework The implementation of the national level financial inclusion strategy would be successful by effective coordination of all the stakeholders and encouraging decentralized approach by creating a forum to actively involve Gram PanchayatsCivil SocietyNGOs to accelerate financial Inclusion We have come a long way in delivering financial services to hitherto excluded sections and segments of our vast country Going forward the FI strategy would focus on deepening the reach usage and sustainability of financial inclusion Technology A key driver for sustainable agriculture 16 Technology has powered Indian agriculture time and again by helping overcome productivity stagnation strengthening market linkages and enhancing farm management Globally it has been established that technology adoption modernizes farmers production practices and leads to uniform annual returns for farmers reduced risk of crop failure and increased yields Hence at the macro level the agricultural development policies should focus on leveraging technology with the goals of i achieving high growth by raising productivity ii inclusiveness by improving coverage of lagging regions small and marginal farmers landlesstenantoral lessee and women farmers and iii sustainability of agriculture 17 I feel that new age technological solutions in the form of product service or application by agristartups can build up a smart agriculture value chain that will enhance the sustainability of agriculture Agristartups may focus on some key areas such as supply chain infrastructure development finance related solutions farm data analytics and information platforms In my opinion agristartups can succeed and can be scaled up only in a conducive ecosystem which is possible if agribusiness industry comes forward and deepens its engagement with agristartups Conclusion 18 I would like to summarise that in the past Indian agriculture faced a formidable challenge to grow more food Today we are a food surplus country and a net exporter of many agriculture and allied products This requires the government policies related to agriculture to be shifted from that of managing food scarcity to managing food surplus Today agriculture in India faces an even more demanding challenge to grow agriproduce sustainably inclusively and responsibly This can be achieved when all the stakeholders align their policies and actions towards the SDGs As far as financing of agriculture is concerned going forward banks will have to integrate sustainability into their business strategy and decisionmaking processes in order to support environmentally responsible and sustainable projects in the agriculture sector For this banks will have to undertake innovative agricultural financing models so that environment friendly and sustainable projects can be supported With this I conclude and wish you all the best 1 httpsdataworldbankorgindicatorSLAGREMPLZS 2 Various reports of MoSPI 3 Economic Survey 201819 Volume II Chapter 7 Agriculture and Food

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1073&fn=2754,Date 17th CD Deshmukh Memorial Lecture,This role encapsulates the essence of renewed national focus on Financial Inclusion promoting financial education and literacy and making credit available to productive sectors of the economy including the rural and MSME sector On behalf of the Reserve Bank of India I am delighted to welcome Mr Agustin Carstens General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements to deliver the C D Deshmukh Memorial lecture the seventeenth in the series We are also honored to have Smt and Shri Atul Deshmukh from late Shri C D Deshmukhs family A hearty welcome to all the distinguished invitees of the Reserve Bank 2 At the outset I would like to say a few words about Shri C D Deshmukh to commemorate the occasion Shri Chintaman Dwarkanath Deshmukh was born in Nata near Fort Raigad in Maharashtra on January 14 1896 He had an outstanding educational career He stood first in the Matriculation examination of the University of Bombay in 1912 He graduated from Jesus College of Cambridge University in 1917 and topped the Indian Civil Services examination then held only in London in 1918 Upon his return to India in 1920 he worked in the Government of Bihar and also as a joint secretary to the Government of India 3 His association with the RBI began in July 1939 when he was appointed Liaison Officer to keep the Government of India in touch with the Banks affairs Three months later he was appointed Secretary of the Central Board of the Bank and two years later in December 1941 as the Deputy Governor He was the first Indian to be appointed as the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India on August 11 1943 and he continued in this capacity till June 30 1949 He played a pivotal role in the creation of Industrial Finance Corporation and promotion of rural credit During his tenure RBI saw enactment of the Banking Companies Act 1949 which laid the foundation for regulation of banking sector in India The nationalisation of RBI on January 1 1949 also took place during his tenure 4 After his tenure in the RBI Shri Deshmukh went on to become Member Planning Commission when it was set up in 1950 Subsequently he became Union Finance Minister in 1950 and served with distinction till July 1956 During his tenure he made significant contributions to the formulation and implementation of the countrys First and Second Five Year Plans He was instrumental in the enactment of new Companies Act and nationalisation of the Imperial Bank of India and life insurance companies After resignation from Union Cabinet he worked as Chairman of UGC during 1956 to 1961 and ViceChancellor of University of Delhi from 1962 to 1967 In 1975 he was bestowed with the Padma Vibhushan award He was also a corecipient of the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1959 for distinguished Government Service 5 For this years Memorial Lecture in honour of Shri CD Deshmukh it is our pleasure to have Mr Agustin Carstens with us He was the Governor of the Central Bank of Mexico from 2010 to 2017 and a member of the BIS Board from 2011 to 2017 As a BIS board member he chaired the Global Economy Meetings and the Meetings of Economic Consultative Council He also headed the International Monetary and Financial Committee the IMFs policy advisory committee for two years 6 Mr Carstens began his career at the Bank of Mexico in 1980 where he has worked in various capacities He later served as Mexicos deputy finance minister and as Deputy Managing Director at the IMF He was Mexicos Finance Minister from 2006 to 2009 He has also been a member of the Financial Stability Board since 2010 and is a member of the Group of Thirty 7 Mr Carstens holds a doctoral degree in economics from University of Chicago and has extensive research experience in the field of macroeconomic issues and finance His work on Latin American Central Bank Reform Progress and Challenges which takes stock of the institutional reforms of monetary policy in Latin America since the early 1990s was widely acknowledged 8 Today Mr Carstens will speak on Central Banking and Innovation Partners in the Quest for Financial Inclusion a topic which could easily be the most relevant at the current juncture The recent emergence of fintech or digital innovations in finance is potentially a strong transformative force to shape the financial sector globally A great benefit of these technological developments is the scope to expand financial outreach in a cost effective manner At the same time however there are regulatory and supervisory challenges which the central banks across the globe need to address 9 The Reserve Bank is committed to promote and deepen the cause of financial inclusion in India The recent developments in FinTech have given a fresh impetus to financial inclusion process in the country Taking cognisance of exponential growth of digitisation and online commerce in India policy efforts have been directed in recent years to put in place a state of the art national payments infrastructure and technology platformThe Reserve Bank is continuously aligning its regulatory and supervisory framework so that the evolution of FinTech can be leveraged to widen and ease the financial access by the excluded population In view of the growing significance of FinTech innovations and their interface with the financial sector as well as financial sector entities the Reseve Bank is strengthening its surveillance framework and has also issued draft guidelines on Enabling Framework for Regulatory Sandbox for obtaining the comments of stakeholders Mr Carstenss talk today will surely give us relevant insights in this direction Let me now invite Mr Carstens to deliver his lecture
https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1043&fn=2754,Date Priority Sector Lending Status Issues and Future Agenda,This role encapsulates the essence of renewed national focus on Financial Inclusion promoting financial education and literacy and making credit available to productive sectors of the economy including the rural and MSME sector Colleagues from College of Agricultural Banking CAB Incharges of Priority Sector Lending in various banks assembled here and my colleagues from various regional offices of RBI who have joined over video Conference A very Good Morning to all of you I consider hosting of this Conference on Credit Flow to priority sector by the CAB a very timely initiative indeed Such conferences are extremely important as they provide a platform for exchange of views and feedback that serves as inputs for policy formulation I believe that policies framed in isolation will look good on paper but would not serve much purpose when implemented on ground Introduction 2 The overarching philosophy behind prescribing the priority sector target for banks is to enable sections of society which though credit worthy are unable to receive credit from the formal system either in adequate measure or in a timely manner There are economic reasons why some sectorsborrowers do not receive adequate finance At any given point of time the lendable resources at institutions are limited and there is always a tradeoff between how much time and effort can be put in and what kind of topline and bottom line the new businesses would generate Given this sort of business dynamics it is possible that the sectors which rightly deserve bank credit get excluded This is precisely the motivation behind institution of priority sector lending norms These guidelines are revised from time to time keeping in view the developments in the economy Priority Sector Lending PSL A Business Case 3 Before I come to specifics let me touch upon certain policy and strategy issues The PSL Guidelines have been in existence for a long time now there are targets sub targets but sadly most of the time these norms are viewed more as a matter of compliance The first and the most important message which I would like the PSL chiefs of the banks present here to carry to your senior management and the Board of Directors is that lending to priority sector is good business for all the right and justifiable reasons Perhaps it would be possible for you to put across your arguments more persuasively now than ever before I say so because in the last few years we have seen over exposure of banking system to large corporates and consequences thereof The excessive lending to corporate sector was the outcome of what I call least input and maximum output approach With little effort one could create large credit volumes whereas creating similar volumes in the priority sector would have required commitment of larger resources in terms of branch staff and operating people 4 There is another dimension to why focusing on smaller loans would become all the more necessary now and that is the regulatory aspect Couple of noteworthy changes have happened in the recent past i there is a revision of single and group borrower exposure limit ii an overall ceiling on exposure of an entity to the banking system has been mandated These developments would push the corporates to gradually shift to markets for meeting their funding requirements Apart from bitter experience of the past and need for risk diversification earning potential presented by priority sector lending is another reason why banks should look elsewhere for better business opportunities Having said that we have already been witnessing a conscious move by the banks into retail segment from corporate I am not suggesting that movement to retail is not okay but from overall economic and credit perspective retail loans are not productive loans in the hands of the borrower as they neither generate income nor they lead to further economic activities On the contrary loans to segments such as agriculture small and micro enterprises do support economic activities generate income and also surplus Such borrowers then become worthy recipients of retail credit That is the larger philosophy and reason for moving over to priority sector as a business case Is there a true priority sector vertical 5 The second thing which I want to mention something which is more relevant for public sector banks to some extent for RRBs and possibly for some private sector banks as well is about the way the priority sector vertical works Typically in a public sector bank the responsibility for priority sector is spread across several verticals There is a rural credit or an agricultural finance vertical a separate MSME vertical the affordable housing segment may be part of retail and the renewable energy the medium industries included in the priority sector in the last revision quite possibly may be with midcorporate or large credit or corporate group There may even be another financial inclusion vertical sitting still separately I am not sure whether there is any coordinated effort between these verticals to chalk out a comprehensive strategy for lending to priority sector Resultantly the priority sector vertical is reduced to a data collection and statement generating vertical Further I am also not sure how many Bank Boards discuss priority sector strategy in the board meetings 6 It is necessary that all these verticals evolve within themselves and come together as a cohesive group prepare a strategy and then take it to the Board for broader discussion and guidance The priority sector activity should not remain confined to being a mere data collection exercise Is there a linkage between plan approved by SLBC and plan of the priority sector vertical 7 There are several agencies involved with priority sector activities of banks There is the SLBC structure wherein District Credit Plan DCP is prepared and the Lead Bank offices operate at district level NABARD prepares the Potential Linked Credit Plan PLP SLBC adopts it and then it is distributed amongst all banks I have a suspicion that between the overall priority sector strategy and what happens at the SLBC and DCP level there may not necessarily be any logical linkage In RBI we are looking at revamping the entire structure of SLBC and as such some of these will undergo a change Data extraction and its implications for priority sector 8 Currently we have a project underway within RBI which would enable extraction of data directly from banks Core Banking Systems CBS In the entire credit planning exercise data infirmity has been a major factor and in some sense has become an impediment for banks in arriving at right conclusion and right strategies This project is at a fairly advanced stage now However once this is implemented it should not once again be seen as a data cleaning and compliance exercise This is a great opportunity for banks because they can use the data apply analytics and prepare the right sort of strategy They can decide on their focus area and product once this robust set of data is available It is important that the seniorlevel functionaries appreciate this exercise in that sense Research 9 The last point that I would like to make on the broader policy and strategy aspect is that time has come for individual banks to also invest in research not very intense academic research but research to the extent that is helpful in making policies and business strategies relevant for their own purpose 10 Let me now come to some recent changes and emerging opportunities in the priority sector Diversified Universe 11 In the last revision the scope of priority sector has been enhanced substantially Some new sectors like renewable energy medium enterprises agro processing social infrastructure and agricultural infrastructure have been included Thus new activities have been allowed but at the same time to make sure that the most deprived within this large umbrella are not put to disadvantage certain sublimits for small and marginal farmers and micro enterprises have also been introduced This kind of revision and structure gives the flexibility to each one of you to identify your area of strength and put maximum effort there This way you can generate surplus and trade that in the Priority Sector Lending Certificate PSLC market while buying certificates in areas where others have generated surplus This is how the whole philosophy of PSLC will work I will dwell upon the developments in the PSLC market a little later Potential for job creation selfemployment and implications for priority sector 12 There are few emerging opportunities One arises from the demographic changes which lead to entry of large number of jobseeking youth within the system It would not be realistic to expect all of them to be absorbed only in the formal sector Many of them would be gainfully employed in pursuing vocations like lowlevel manufacturing services or would operate small enterprises Thus large number of people will have the potential of being selfemployed and that by translation would mean business for banks There are various GoI initiatives like Make in India Start Up India which are aimed at providing a fillip to this eco system But unless there is research analysis of data policy and strategy these opportunities cannot be exploited completely Rapid Urbanisation and its implication for priority sector 13 The other broad phenomenon which is unraveling and would likely accelerate in the days ahead is rapid urbanization At present about 32 of the population lives in urban areas and it is expected that in next ten to fifteen years this figure will be around 42 This phenomenon once again brings to the fore the need for proper communication among various verticals and a cohesive strategy for the bank a whole For example the people shifting from rural to urban areas they may be your client in rural area but when they migrate to semiurban or urban areas is there any exchange of information between the rural and the semi urban urban branches about where these people are migrating Such communication assumes significance because when they migrate they would have new needs and they might adopt a vocation which may need funding thats why I am suggesting that as a business strategy banks need to have an integrated approach They must create appropriate communication channels to tap such potential in the migrating population Is Financial Inclusion FI a part of priority sector 14 As I mentioned earlier in many banks FI is a separate vertical In such situation again there would be absence of coordination One very strong and nuanced point which you really have to carry back from this conference and work on is that we become conditioned to working in a certain kind of organizational set up we continue to work in silos a thought never comes to the mind that there may be a need to integrate all this and it can throw up a very interesting and new structure I suggest that you can include the FI vertical as part of the priority sector vertical if it exists separately within your overall strategy Low cost credit delivery through Technology 15 Finally what you need to bear in mind is that the small and marginal farmer micro enterprises affordable housing very well become half or more than half of the priority sector However if this segment is to be served profitably it can only be done with intense use of technology and therefore banks need to have low cost delivery model Quite a few banks both from public and private sector have developed technologybased low cost credit delivery models and are doing quite well Use of Alternative credit scoring models 16 The segment comprising of micro enterprises etc if you try to fit them in regular credit rating scoring model that will not work If you want to judge them against the usual norms of debt equity ratio debt service coverage ratios etc it will be a nonstarter Therefore you have to look at the method of credit scoring again A lot of work in this regard has been done in our financial system and many players have moved to credit scoring where payment history remittance history bill payment history etc are collected as data points for analyzing borrowers repayment capabilities Today all these data points are available one way or the other Some of the banks have used it for developing preapproved limits for small borrowers This is done in advance and borrowers do not need to approach the banks rather it is the banks that approach the borrowers We have had hunting limits for corporates and now the time has come when this has to be made available to small borrowers and the common person 17 These are some issues that I wished to share with you on the execution side of priority sector One has to be mindful of the opportunities which are emerging and take advantage of these opportunities to make priority sector lending successful Performance under Priority Sector Lending 18 Now I will quickly come to some of the issues around credit flow to priority sector When I look at the performance under newly introduced sub targets for 201617 though the data is provisional I find some interesting trends Both public sector and private sector banks have done well under overall priority sector lending targets Public sector as a group is slightly below 40 mark whereas private sector banks have exceeded 40 by a good margin Foreign banks with more than 20 branches are adhering to their roadmap as they have to gradually reach the milestones Foreign banks with less than 20 branches as of now also appear to be on track 19 While in the case of small and marginal farmer target the public sector banks have slightly exceeded the sublimit of 8 the private sector banks have fallen short of these targets and achieved around 5 during 201516 Even in 201617 it has not improved substantially On the other hand the public sector banks could not achieve the subtarget under micro enterprise while the private sector banks could exceed the target more than 8 in this segment It quietly brings a larger point that the priority sector activities of private sector banks still remains predominantly urban focused even while they have developed good rural network and if not so alternatively the hub and spoke model is functioning I will leave it to the strategies of banks as to the areas on which they want to focus however one has to be conscious that there may not be an unending supply of PSLCs if there is a gross deficit coming from one particular subsegment Perhaps it will be a good business strategy to leave the deficit in marginal terms and not in a larger percentage as it may later on prove to be a costly situation Enablers in Priority Sector Lending 20 Now let me briefly touch upon some of the enablers which have been put for the increased credit flow particularly to MSME sector because this is a sector which is very important and crucial for job creation which is both a requirement and a challenge for the country a MSME Sector i Factoring transactions To increase liquidity support for the MSME sector RBI had allowed factoring transactions on with recourse basis to be classified as eligible for priority sector by banks Further the factoring transactions taking place through TReDS are also eligible for classification under priority sector It is understood that many banks have their own vendor finance platforms akin to TReDS where they are undertaking factoring transactions on without recourse basis to MSME and with recourse to the corporate Since two entities licensed under TReDS have become operational it is expected that it will lead to better price discovery and more favorable rates for MSMEs With added benefit of priority sector status banks may actively consider undertaking without recourse factoring transactions through TReDS ii Capacity Building Over the last two years CAB has taken a major initiative for capacity building of bankers for lending to MSMEs popularly known as NAMCABS I understand till now more than 5000 bankers have been trained If we reflect back NAMCABS has put emphasis on three categories of participants i policy makers at the corporate office ii officers sitting in specialized MSME branches and iii the trainers in the individual banks training establishments However CAB cannot be expected to train the entire banking community Idea was to create a focus group within the bank which could act as the force multiplier But if these trained resources are not gainfully employed then it defeats the very purpose of the capacity building efforts being made by the College iii Cluster Approach Empirical evidence suggests that the MSME lending is much more meaningful and strong if cluster approach is adopted Rather than financing stray units on standalone basis if the banks are looking for business opportunity and furthering credit flow to units having strong repayment potential then cluster approach becomes very much meaningful I would suggest that not only should banks focus on financing in existing clusters but also encourage promoting of such clusters To do so banks need to have a strong data base support and inhouse research to identify the area the activity and develop a delivery model iv Coorigination of loans The next point relating to MSME and more so to micro units is something about which I have been speaking in various fora for quite some time This is on coorigination of loans where some work is being done within the RBI If one looks at the sector which has received maximum credit from banks it is the financial intermediation sector This means banks have been lending to NBFCs MFIs housing finance companies for onlending purposes To my mind this is an example of lazy banking and no one gets benefitted at the end neither the banker nor the ultimate borrower So can we develop a regular co origination model Banks and NBFCs MFIs can join together in origination of loans in a certain agreed structure of risk sharing and various covenants around the loan This will provide a good avenue to banks to expand their portfolio and diversify their risk It will be remunerative also and at the same time will help banks priority sector compliance as well This is under discussion in RBI and we will take a final view in some time b Priority Sector Lending Certificate PSLC The response to the PSLC trading has been encouraging In the first year itself about 126549 crore worth of offers were put on the PSLC platform out of which roughly 49800 crore worth of offers were settled which is a good beginning Among the four categories under PSLC trading higher trading is observed under PSLCSmall and Marginal Farmers and PSLC General Category Among the four categories the transaction volume is about 23000 crore under small and marginal farmers 20000 crore under general category and rest of the amount under other two categories As expected most of the trading occurred especially at the end of the quarters since the priority sector lending targets are currently monitored quarterly The PSLCs which were traded in the first quarter were traded at higher premium and this is obvious because the PSL rights get extinguished by March 31st PSLC platform is an order matching platform but a disquieting feature that we have observed is that some entities strike a bilateral trade and then put it on the platform which vitiates the spirit of anonymous order matching PSLC should be used as it is designed and meant to be used and not merely as a reporting platform 21 Before concluding I would quickly mention a few things which are relevant to all categories of banks public sector private sector regional rural banks and small finance banks i Low cost housing and sanitation Within priority sector low cost housing is emerging as a high potential area and banks should focus on that In the last revision we have allowed lending to individual sanitation infrastructure to qualify as priority sector There is also a national mission for Swachh Bharat and a movement for creation of toilets in individual household by Government of India Within the overall priority sector planning banks must look to focus on providing lending for creation of sanitation infrastructure ii Agriculture Value Chain financing The second area is agrifinancing Until and unless there is an organized movement to finance agriculture value chain this will remain more a compliance activity and will not provide the kind of benefit the economy should receive Unless agrifinancing is dovetailed with value chain the credit flow to this segment will be more of a compliance matter iii Financing water conservation and solar pumps as an economic activity The third area is water conservation From my personal experience from my previous stint in a commercial bank I can say that water conservation can be exploited as an economic activity for bank credit in many parts of the country In time of drought it supports crop cultivation and in long term facilitates raising of ground water table Banks should look at it critically Again this activity requires research survey and building up a model to reach out to farmers Similarly solar pumpsets could be another area for bank finance All these efforts will be very much meaningful for small and marginal holdings These are the kind of things which can prove meaningful but this will be an incomplete exercise without simultaneously providing support to financial literacy iv SHG Bank Linkage Model Another area is SHG model SHG model has been a robust model in the past There has however been some slowdown of late but banks should also look critically into the credit delivery through SHG bank linkage model v Rural Posting Specifically in public sector banks there is a need to critically look at the entire policy of rural posting There are rules and other regulatory requirements but within that framework banks need to have a more meaningful policy for rural posting Bank staff posted in rural areas should remain there for a reasonable period and second whatever period they are there they should deliver to an optimum extent I know this is a major issue in the functioning of rural branches of banks and as incharges you need to look into this area closely vi Small Finance Banks SFBs RBI has recently come out with a detailed compendium of priority sector guidelines for SFBs SFBs have also been allowed to trade in PSLCs once they are operational even without waiting for acquiring scheduled status More than 15 of trade happening under PSLC is by SFBs which is a healthy trend From the current year itself the SFBs have been allowed to participate in SLBC meetings but there is no requirement for them in the annual credit plan until April 2018 For SFBs payment banks as their BCs could emerge as a good combination as many payment banks have wide lastmile reach Conclusion 22 I would like to conclude here just by mentioning that all of you as incharges of priority sector lending in your respective banks can make a difference in a large constituency which is priority sector Each credit extended by banks to priority sector can be a life changing event and the priority sector credit as a whole can change the lives of a multitude of people of this country You have to consider your role as that of a change agent I urge all of you to schedule a discussion with your Top Management convey to them the take away from this conference and then take it to your Board I wish you all the best and thank CAB for inviting me to address this gathering 1Inaugural Address by Shri S S Mundra Deputy Governor Reserve Bank of India during the Conference on Credit flow to Priority Sector Policy and Implementation held at College of Agricultural Banking Reserve Bank of India Pune on June 27 2017

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_FAQs.aspx?Id=87&fn=2754,FAQs on Master Directions on Priority Sector Lending Guidelines,This role encapsulates the essence of renewed national focus on Financial Inclusion promoting financial education and literacy and making credit available to productive sectors of the economy including the rural and MSME sector Updated as on November 09 2021 A Computation of Adjusted Net Bank Credit ANBC Query 1 How to adjust PSLC buyPSLC sale in the computation of ANBC Clarification The net PSLC outstanding PSLC Buy minus PSLC Sell is added to the Net Bank Credit as mentioned in para 6 of the Master Directions on PSL 2020 updated from time to time Further a PSLC remains outstanding until its expiry s no ix of Notification on Priority Sector Lending certificates dated April 07 2016 All PSLCs will expire by March 31st and will not be valid beyond the reporting date ie March 31st irrespective of the date it was first boughtsold Accordingly the effect of PSLC buy is increase in ANBC and conversely the effect of PSLC sell is decrease in ANBC and the net of PSLC buysell is adjusted to the ANBC for every quarter Thus a PSLC bought or sold in any quarter will have to be taken into account in all subsequent quarters till the end of the FY to which it pertains Query 2 The Face Value of securities acquired and kept under HTM category under the TLTRO 20 Press Release 201920202237 dated April 17 2020 read with Q11 of FAQ and SLFMF Press Release 201920202276 dated April 27 2020 and also Extended Regulatory Benefits under SLFMF Scheme vide Press Release 201920202294 dated April 30 2020 are permitted to be excluded from computation of Adjusted Net Bank Credit ANBC for the purpose of determining Priority Sector Lending targetsubtargets How this exclusion is to be made Clarification The Master Directions on Priority Sector Lending 2020 under para 6 provides for computation of Adjusted Net Bank Credit The face value of securities availed under TLTRO 20 and SLFMF including the Extended Regulatory Benefits are to be reduced as given in IX of para 61 of the Master Directions on PSL Since these securities are considered as HTM investments the banks have to add them as Bondsdebentures in NonSLR categories under HTM category as given in X of para 61 of the Master Directions on PSL It is envisaged that the Priority Sector Lending targetsubtargets should not increase on account of securities acquired under TLTRO 20 and SLFMF including the Extended Regulatory Benefits By adding the face value of securities X and reducing the face value of securities IX there will be no increase in ANBC due to investments in TLTRO 20 and SLFMF including the Extended Regulatory Benefits Query 3 Whether the deposits with DFIs viz NABARD SIDBI MUDRA NHB on account of PSL shortfall can be counted towards achievement of PSL targets subtargets and ANBC Clarification Banks can reckon outstanding deposits with NABARD under Agriculture and overall PSL achievement while deposits with SIDBI MUDRA and NHB can be reckoned only for overall PSL achievement Banks should also add these deposits to Net Bank Credit NBC for computation of Adjusted Net Bank Credit ANBC However deposits with NABARD SIDBI MUDRA and NHB cannot be reckoned for subtarget achievement viz SMF NCF Micro and weaker section Query 4 In terms of paragraph 3 of the circulars DBODNoRetBC361201001201314 dated August 14 2013 and DBODNoRetBC931201001201314 dated January 31 2014 banks were advised that advances extended in India against the incremental FCNR B NRE deposits qualifying for exemption from CRR SLR requirements under the above circular will be excluded from the Adjusted Net Bank Credit ANBC for computation of priority sector lending targets till their repayment What is the method of arriving at the extent of such advances Clarification i In terms of circular under reference the amount eligible for exclusion from ANBC is the incremental advances extended out of the resources generated from the eligible incremental FCNR B NRE deposits The incremental advance is calculated as the difference between outstanding advances in India as on March 7 2014 and the Base Date July 26 2013 ii The amount to be excluded from ANBC for computation of priority sector target will of course not exceed incremental FCNR B NRE deposits eligible for exemption from maintenance of CRR SLR in terms of circulars under reference iii In case the difference in amount of outstanding advances between March 7 2014 and base date is zero or negative no amount would be eligible for deduction from ANBC for the purpose of arriving at the priority sector lending targets Query 5 Are banks permitted to exclude bills purchaseddiscountednegotiated payment to beneficiary not under reserve while calculating the Bank Credit in India Clarification The bills purchased discounted negotiated payment to beneficiary not under reserve under LC is allowed to be treated as Interbank exposure only for the limited purpose of computing exposure and capital requirements It should not be excluded from the computation of bank credit in India As prescribed in item NoVI of Form A under Section 422 of the RBI Act 1934 which allows for exclusion of interbank advance While exposure may be to the LC issuing bank the bills purchaseddiscounted amounts to bank credit to its borrower constituent If this advance is eligible for priority sector classification then bank can claim it as PSL Banks have to take note of the above aspect while reporting Net Bank Credit in India as well as computing the Adjusted Net Bank Credit for PSL targets and achievement B Adjustment for Weights in PSL Achievement Query 6 How will the incremental weights be calculated as per revised guidelines Clarification As detailed in Para 7 of the Master Directions on Priority Sector lending 2020 on Adjustments for weights in PSL Achievement differential weightage in the incremental credit to the priority sector areas shall be reckoned from FY 202122 onwards There will be 125 weightage on incremental credit to select 184 districts with low per capita PSL credit and 90 weightage on incremental credit to select 205 districts with high per capita PSL credit The incremental weights will be calculated on targets subtargets Accordingly the allocation to RIDF and other funds shall be done on the basis of total shortfall including the shortfall calculated on incremental credit as per prescribed differential weights Query 7 Will the weights be applicable in case of decline in credit or negative incremental credit Clarification If there is a decline in credit the weighted incremental credit will be zero 0 The methodology as given below will be considered for all the districts for which data is reported in ADEPT The banks are requested to get in touch with our Statistics Division fiddstatsrbiorgin regarding the format for submission of returns under ADEPT in case the same have not been submitted till date by the bank Further based on the methodology detailed above banks are expected monitor their own PSL achievement during the year taking into account the prescription of differential weights for credit disbursed in identified districts for the purpose of trading in PSLCs Avg achievement will be the average of four quarters of a year as on reporting dates of QPSA Similar calculations will be done for other PSL targets Query 8 What is the criteria for mapping credit to a particular district Clarification For mapping a credit facility to a particular district the Place of utilization of Credit shall be the qualifying criteria Query 9 In case of achieving priority sector through indirect routes viz PSLCs IBPCs Onlending Securitization Assignment etc the place of utilization may not be available on ADePT for mapping the individual account level data How will the incremental credit be calculated in such case Clarification While calculating districtwise incremental credit for assigning weights the organic credit ie only the credit directly disbursed by banks and for which the actual borrowerbeneficiary wise details are maintained in the books of the bank will be considered Credit disbursed through the following inorganic routes shall not be considered for incremental weights Investments by banks in securitised assets Transfer of Assets through Direct Assignment Outright purchase Inter Bank Participation Certificates IBPCs Priority Sector Lending Certificates PSLCs Bank loans to MFIs NBFCMFIs Societies Trusts etc for onlending Bank loans to NBFCs for onlending Bank loans to HFCs for onlending C Agriculture Query 10 Can bank loans against gold be classified under priority sector Clarification The PSL guidelines are activity and beneficiary specific and are not based on type of collateral Therefore bank loans given to individuals businesses for undertaking agriculture activities do not automatically become ineligible for priority sector classification only on account of the fact that underlying asset is gold jewelleryornament etc It may however be noted that as per FIDD Circular dated February 7 2019 and updated from time to time it has been advised that banks may waive margin requirements for agricultural loans upto 16 lakh Therefore bank should have extended the loan based on scale of finance and assessment of credit requirement for undertaking the agriculture activity and not solely based on available collateral in the form of gold Further as applicable to all loans under PSL banks should put in place proper internal controls and systems to ensure that the loans extended under priority sector are for approved purposes and the end use is continuously monitored Query 11 Can loans given to landless individuals engaged in allied activities be classified under priority sector lending SMF category Clarification Bank loans up to 2 lakh to individuals solely engaged in allied activities without any accompanying land holding criteria are entitled for classification under SMF category of priority sector lending Further farmers availing loans under SMF based on land holding are also eligible for loans under allied activities upto 2 lakhs and the same can be also be classified under SMF category Query 12 What due diligence should banks ensure while classifying loans under PSLAgricultureSMF Clarification Bank should ensure proper documentation for classifying agricultural loans under PSL as approved by their board Particularly while classifying loans under agricultureSMF category the bank should maintain details regarding location where the borrower is tilling the land details of crop grown hypothecation of crops if any sanction of loan based on scale of finance record of field visit by bank officials to monitor end use of agricultural loans etc Some of the above aspects should be available with the bank in the absence of copy of land recordlease deed particularly in case of agriculture loans to landless labourers share croppers etc Query 13 How should the banks ensure adherence to the credit cap of 100 crore from banking system while extending credit to activities under Agriculture Infrastructure or Food AgroProcessing categories Clarification As per extant guidelines loans for Agriculture Infrastructure or loans for Food Agroprocessing activity are each subject to an aggregate sanctioned limit of 100 crore per borrower from the banking system In case aggregate exposure across the banking industry exceeds the limit of 100 crore then total exposure will cease to be classified under PSL category The sanctioned limit of 100 crore has to be ascertained facility wise for a particular entity and is exclusive of the other borrowings of the entity for PSL nonPSL purposes However it needs to be ensured that the bank has assessed and sanctioned separate limits for the specific purpose of Agriculture Infrastructure or Food Agro Processing activities of the entity to qualify as PSL Banks should take a declaration from the borrower regarding loan sanctioned by any other banks for the same activity and also independently seek confirmation from those banks In the scenario where new sanction by the bank leads to overall limit across banks to more than 100 crore it needs to inform other banks too about the same Accordingly all other banks need to declassify the same from PSL Query 14 Loans are extended to Cargo Companies Shipping Companies Roadlines Co Transport Cos Logistic Cos Movers and Carriers etc for purchasing Commercial Vehicles These transport and shipping companies act as a Carrier Transporter for such Enterprises which are into food and agro processing business Whether bank loans to such a transporter who acts as a carrier and does not have any food and agro processing setup themselves are eligible for classification under priority sector Clarification As per AnnexIII of Master Directions on Priority Sector Lending PSL dated September 4 2020 transportation is an eligible activity under indicative list of permissible activities under Food Processing Sector However while classifying any facility to transporters for purchasing Commercial Vehicles under Food Agroprocessing category it needs to be ensured that the transporter is using the vehicle exclusively for transportation of food agroprocessed products or is a type of vehicle which is specifically used for Food Agroprocessing eg cold storage trucks vans etc If the commercial vehicle is also used for transportation of products other than those related to food agro processing the facility shall not be eligible for classification under Food Agroprocessing category In such cases the same may be classified under MSME Services if it meets the conditions prescribed for the same in our Master Direction on PSL Query 15 Can bank loans extended to companies for buying commercial vehicles be eligible for classification under Agriculture Infrastructure category of priority sector Clarification While classifying any facility to transporters for purchasing Commercial Vehicles under Agriculture Infrastructure category it needs to be ensured that the transporter subcontractor is using the vehicle exclusively for activities that are ancillary to Agriculture Infrastructure If the commercial vehicle is also used for transportation for purposes under nonagriculture infrastructure category the facility shall not be eligible for classification under Agriculture Infrastructure In such cases the same may be classified under MSME Services if it meets the conditions prescribed for the same in our Master Direction on PSL D MSME Query 16 Whether the continuity of the PSL status for 3 years is still applicable to MSMEs that have breached the threshold limit as per the new definition of MSMEs Clarification Government of India GoI vide Gazette Notification SO 2119 E dated June 26 2020 and updated from time to time has notified the new composite criteria of investment in plant machinery as well as turnover for classification of an enterprise under MSME Under the composite criteria if an enterprise crosses the ceiling limits specified for its present category in either of the two criteria of investment or turnover it will cease to exist in that category and be placed in the next higher category but no enterprise shall be placed in the lower category unless it goes below the ceiling limits specified for its present category in both the criteria of investment as well as turnover Based on the new definition the earlier criteria regarding continuity of PSL status for three years even after an enterprise grows out of the MSME category concerned is no longer valid E Export Credit Query 17 What is the permissible cap for export credit under priority sector lending Clarification Bank lending to export credit under agriculture and MSME sectors is classified as PSL under the respective categories viz agriculture and MSME and there is no cap on credit for the same Export Credit other than in agriculture and MSME is classified as priority sector as per the following table Query 18 While calculating cap on Export Credit whether it can be averaged over four quarters of a financial year Clarification With effect from FY 202021 all banks are allowed to compute the eligible portfolio under Export Credit by averaging across four quarters to determine adherence to the prescribed caps ie 32 percent for Foreign Banks with less than 20 branches and 2 percent for others The cap on exports is based on ANBCCEOBE of Current FY F Education Query 19 In the revised PSL guidelines 20 lakh is referred to Outstanding Limit or Sanctioned Limit Clarification Only such loans that are within the sanctioned limit of 20 lakh shall be eligible for priority sector classification Query 20 If the same borrower is having multiple education loans with different opening dates before and after 040920 which value is required to be considered under PSL 0s of 10 lakhs per borrower or Limit of 20 lakhs per borrower For instance Student had an education loan of 12 Lakhs prior to 04092020 then avails second education loan of 18 Lakhs after 04092020 how PSL outstanding will be calculated for this particular customer Clarification For the loans sanctioned before September 4 2020 outstanding value up to 10 lakh irrespective of the sanctioned limit shall continue to be classified under priority sector till maturity However while reckoning any fresh loan under PSL to a borrower who had already availed education loan from the bank prior to September 4 2020 it needs to be ensured that the aggregate sanctioned limit does not exceed 20 lakh for classification of the loans under PSL In the mentioned scenario as the combined sanctioned limit becomes 30 lakh the 18 lakh loan extended after September 4 2020 shall not be eligible for PSL classification However with regard to the 12 lakh loan which was already PSL as per earlier guidelines the outstanding value under the facility up to 10 lakh shall continue to be eligible under PSL till maturity Query 21 Under revised PSL guidelines sanctioned limit has been capped at 20 lakhs If a customer is sanctioned a loan of 20 lakhs and the outstanding amount becomes 22 Lakhs in such a scenario whether entire outstanding will be reckoned for PSL Clarification The outstanding value may exceed 20 lakh on account of accrued interest due to moratorium on repayment during study period Accordingly the entire outstanding amount shall be reckoned for priority sector provided the sanctioned limit does not exceed 20 lakh Query 22 If a student avails two education loans after September 4 2020 for 12 lakhs and 18 lakhs how PSL will be calculated for this particular customer Clarification Post September 4 2020 if the aggregate sanctioned limit of multiple education loans either from a bank or across banks to a single borrower exceeds 20 lakh limit all loans of the borrower sanctioned after September 4 2020 shall become ineligible for PSL classification In this regard banks should take a declaration from the borrower regarding education loan sanctioned by any other banks and also independently seek confirmation from those banks G Social Infrastructure Query 23 How is PSL classification considered for lending to Social Infrastructure activities viz Schools etc prescribed limit of 5 crore and Health Care Facilities prescribed limit of 10 crore which can also be classified as MSME Service based on definition as per MSME Act Clarification As per Udyam Registration Portal NIC Codes under Services as Major Activity Education Health Activities are eligible activities for classification under MSME Services Therefore bank loans for above purposes can be classified under MSME Services wherein no cap on credit has been prescribed However banks can classify such activities either under MSME Services or Social Infrastructure and not under both It may be noted that for classification under Social Infrastructure the associated cap on credit shall be applicable H Weaker Sections Query 24 In case of Partnership Firms Pvt Limited can the loan granted be tagged as SMF and Weaker Section if any of the Partner Director is holding Agriculture land upto 2 hectares 5 acres Clarification As per extant guidelines SMF includes individuals SHGs JLGs Farmers Producer Companies FPC and Cooperatives of farmers with the accompanying criteria of membership by number and landholding Therefore loans to partnership firms coborrowers or any director of a Company holding Agriculture land upto 2 hectares 5 acres are not eligible to be classified under the Small and Marginal farmers category of PSL Query 25 In case of a Partnership firm if majority of the partners belong to one or the other of the specified minority communities whether advances granted to such partnership firms can be treated as advances granted to minority communities Further in case of Private Public Ltd Company if any of the borrowers belong to Minority Community can the loan be classified under weaker section category Clarification As per extant guidelines priority sector loans are eligible for classification as loans to minority communities as per the list notified by the GoI from time to time The same may be read with Master Circular Credit Facilities to Minority Communities which under para 22 states In the case of a partnership firm if the majority of the partners belong to one or the other of the specified minority communities advances granted to such partnership firms may be treated as advances granted to minority communities Further if the majority beneficial ownership in a partnership firm belongs to the minority community then such lending can be classified as advances to the specified communities A company has a separate legal entity and hence advances granted to it cannot be classified as advances to the specified minority communities Query 26 Can banks rely on customers declaration for Minority SC ST category to be included under Weaker section Clarification Our guidelines do not mandate banks to obtain documentary evidence for classifying credit facilities to Minorities and SCsSTs under weaker section Therefore declaration by the customer in the application form would suffice However it needs to be ensured that for classification under weaker sections the loans should first be eligible for classification under priority sector lending as per underlying activity I Investment by Banks in securitized assets Transfer of Assets through Direct Assignment Outright Purchase Query 27 How should banks ensure due diligence to ascertain priority sector status of PTC portfolio Clarification The bank may rely on a CA certificate by the originating entity certifying the PSL composition of the pool Additionally bank may conduct a sample check of say 10 of the pool for PSL eligibility The additional check may be conducted by the bank through its own staff or by engaging a CA for this purpose J PSLCs Query 28 How can banks register for PSLC trading Clarification The banks are required to submit a request to FIDD CO fiddplanrbiorgin to obtain registration for PSLC trading by submitting a DEA Fund Code b Customer identification number and c RBI Current account number Query 29 What is the expiry date of PSLC Clarification All PSLCs will be valid till end of FY ie March 31st and will expire on next day ie April 1st Query 30 Whether PSLCs can be issued for a limited period ie for one reporting quarter

Further IGST is payable on the supply of PSLC traded over ekuber portal If a bank which was liable to pay GST had already paid CGSTSGST or CGSTUGST the bank is not required to pay IGST towards such supply Further as per the extant guidelines no transaction charge fees is applicable on the participating banks payable to RBI for usage of the PSLC module on eKuber portal The clarification given above is not a legal advice or opinion in the matter and it may not necessarily reflect the most current legal developments The market participants should seek the advice of the tax expertsconsultantsspecialists before acting upon any of the information provided above Query 32 Whether PSL Weaker Sections or PSL Export Credit can be traded as PSLCs Clarification There are only four eligible categories of PSLCs ie PSLC General PSLC Small and Marginal Farmer PSLC Agriculture PSLC Micro Enterprises Query 33 Whether Export Credit may form a part of PSLC General and whether

NBFC in the respective categories of PSL The classification will be allowed only when the NBFC has disbursed the Priority Sector Loans to the ultimate beneficiary after receiving the funds from the bank The NBFCs must provide a CA certificate to the banks stating that the individual loans of the portfolio against which onlending benefit is being claimed are not being used to claim benefit from any other banks Also NBFC must put in place a suitable process to flag such loans in their systems to enable its internalstatutory auditors as well as RBI supervisors to verify the same b Information sharing The banks may devise internal control mechanisms to ensure that the portfolio under onlending is PSL compliant and adheres to coterminus clause The same should be made available to RBI supervisors as and when required The following informationrecord should be collected by the bank from the EI Name of the beneficiary Amount sanctioned Loan amount outstanding Loan tenure disbursement date category of PSL A statement to the effect that the portfolio is PSL compliant must be certified by a CA and shared by the EI with the bank on a quarterly basis in line with the PSL reporting by the bank to RBI With respect to adherence to the coterminus clause the bank should ensure the same as on March 31 each year c Adherence to coterminus condition The banks availing benefit of onlending for PS assets must adhere to the condition that the tenure of the loan under onlending to an EI is broadly coterminus with the tenure of PS assets created by the EI In view of the operational difficulties of exactly matching the coterminus duration the banks are allowed a variance of 3 months from the portfolio duration An illustration for calculating adherence to the coterminus duration is given below In the above illustration the residual maturity of bank loan to NBFC should be around 2222 months Banks are expected to calculate the weighted average residual maturity of portfolio ever year as on March 31 and ensure that residual maturity of bank loan to NBFC matches with the weighted average residual maturity of onlending portfolio within the tolerance limit of 3 months d Treatment of prepayment foreclosure loans The PS assets created by the entity may undergo prepayment or foreclosure thereby changing the weighted maturity of the portfolio As the banks are required to calculate weighted maturity at the end of FY the loan outstanding in the event of prepaymentforeclosure will also change accordingly The NBFC may add PS assets to the onlending portfolio However it must meet conditions mentioned above such as disbursements for the PS asset by the eligible entity must be onafter receipt of funds from the bank The addition of PS assets to the portfolio pool can also be done in case of prepaymentforeclosure of other PS assets in the pool to ensure adherence to the coterminus clause Query 45 What is the cap for bank lending to NBFCs and HFCs for onlending

exercise its discretion regarding taking into its books the loans originated by NBFC as per the Agreement the arrangement will be akin to a direct assignment transaction If the Agreement entails a prior irrevocable commitment on the part of the bank to take into its books its share of the individual loans as originated by the NBFC it shall not be akin to direct assignment transaction Query 48 Does the term Mandatorily in CLM guidelines means that the bank must take all the loans originated by NBFC or a cap can be affixed on the number and amount in the Master Agreement Clarification Both entities the bank the NBFC shall be guided by the bilateral Master Agreement entered by them for implementing the Colending Model CLM The agreement may state any cap on the number and amount of loans that can be originated by the NBFC under the Colending model Query 49 What will be the fate of loans originated by NBFC which do not qualify under due diligence checks to comply with RBI regulations on KYC and Outsourcing of activities Clarification If the Agreement entails a prior irrevocable commitment on the part of the bank it has been advised that the partner bank and NBFC shall have to put in place suitable mechanisms for exante due diligence by the bank Such due diligence should ensure compliance with RBI regulations on KYC and outsourcing of activities before disbursal of the loans by the NBFC Query 50 Does the term backtoback mean loan accounts will first be opened by NBFC and thereafter bank will open loan accounts in its books or both will open loan accounts and fund them simultaneously based on the loan agreement signed by the borrower with the NBFC Clarification Backtoback basis implies that the loans will be first opened by NBFC and then bank will open loan accounts subsequently Query 51 Based on the loan documents executed will the NBFC sanction and disburse the whole amount and thereafter approach the bank for reimbursement or will it sanction disburse its part of the loan and then approach the bank to sanction disburse its part Clarification The bank and the NBFC can decide on this aspect as per the Master agreement between them

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_FAQs.aspx?Id=77&fn=2754,Housing Loans,This role encapsulates the essence of renewed national focus on Financial Inclusion promoting financial education and literacy and making credit available to productive sectors of the economy including the rural and MSME sector 1 For what purposes can I seek a first time home loan You can generally seek a first time home loan for buying a house or a flat renovation extension and repairs to your existing house Most banks have a separate policy for those who are going for a second house Please remember to seek specific clarifications on the abovementioned issues from your commercial bank 2 How will your bank decide your home loan eligibility Your bank will assess your repayment capacity while deciding the home loan eligibility Repayment capacity is based on your monthly disposable surplus income which in turn is based on factors such as total monthly income surplus less monthly expenses and other factors like spouses income assets liabilities stability of income etc The main concern of the bank is to make sure that you comfortably repay the loan on time and ensure end use The higher the monthly disposable income higher will be the amount you will be eligible for loan Typically a bank assumes that about 5560 of your monthly disposable surplus income is available for repayment of loan However some banks calculate the income available for EMI payments based on an individuals gross income and not on his disposable income The amount of the loan depends on the tenure of the loan and the rate of interest also as these variables determine your monthly outgo outflow which in turn depends on your disposable income Banks generally fix an upper age limit for home loan applicants 3 What is an EMI You repay the loan in Equated Monthly Installments EMIs comprising both principal and interest Repayment by way of EMI starts from the month following the month in which you take full disbursement For understanding how EMI is calculated please see annex 4 What documents are generally sought for a loan approval In addition to all legal documents relating to the house being bought banks will also ask you to submit Identity and Residence Proof latest salary slip authenticated by the employer and self attested for employees and Form 16 for business persons selfemployed and last 6 months bank statements Balance Sheet as applicable You also need to submit the completed application form along with your photograph Loan applications form would give a checklist of documents to be attached with the application Do not be in a hurry to seal the deal quickly Please do discuss and seek more information on any waivers in terms and conditions provided by the commercial bank in this regard For example some banks insist on submission of Life Insurance Policies of the borrower guarantor equal to the loan amount assigned in favour of the commercial bank There are usually amount ceilings for this condition which can also be waived by appropriate authority Please read the fine print of the banks scheme carefully and seek clarifications 5 What are the different interest rate options offered by banks Banks generally offer either of the following loan options Floating Rate Home Loans and Fixed Rate Home Loans For a Fixed Rate Loan the rate of interest is fixed either for the entire tenure of the loan or a certain part of the tenure of the loan In case of a pure fixed loan the EMI due to the bank remains constant If a bank offers a Loan which is fixed only for a certain period of the tenure of the loan please try to elicit information from the bank whether the rates may be raised after the period reset clause You may try to negotiate a lockin that should include the rate that you have agreed upon initially and the period the lockin lasts Hence the EMI of a fixed rate loan is known in advance This is the cash outflow that can be planned for at the outset of the loan If the inflation and the interest rate in the economy move up over the years a fixed EMI is attractively stagnant and is easier to plan for However if you have fixed EMI any reduction in interest rates in the market will not benefit you Determinants of floating rate The EMI of a floating rate loan changes with changes in market interest rates If market rates increase your repayment increases When rates fall your dues also fall The floating interest rate is made up of two parts the index and the spread The index is a measure of interest rates generally based on say government securities prices and the spread is an extra amount that the banker adds to cover credit risk profit markup etc The amount of the spread may differ from one lender to another but it is usually constant over the life of the loan If the index rate moves up so does your interest rate in most circumstances and you will have to pay a higher EMI Conversely if the interest rate moves down your EMI amount should be lower Also sometimes banks make some adjustments so that your EMI remains constant In such cases when a lender increases the floating interest rate the tenure of the loan is increased and EMI kept constant Some lenders also base their floating rates on their Benchmark Prime Lending Rates BPLR You should ask what index will be used for setting the floating rate how it has generally fluctuated in the past and where it is publisheddisclosed However the past fluctuation of any index is not a guarantee for its future behavior Flexibility in EMI Some banks also offer their customers flexible repayment options Here the EMIs are unequal In stepup loans the EMI is low initially and increases as years roll by balloon repayment In stepdown loans EMI is high initially and decreases as years roll by Stepup option is convenient for borrowers who are in the beginning of their careers Stepdown loan option is useful for borrowers who are close to their retirement years and currently make good money 6 What is monthly reducing balances method Borrowers benefit more from a loan thats calculated on a monthly reducing basis than on an annual basis In case of monthly resets interest is calculated on the outstanding principal balance for that month The principal paid is deducted from the opening principal outstanding balance to arrive at the opening principal for the next month and interest is computed on the new reduced principal outstanding In case of annual resets principal paid is adjusted only at the end of the year Hence you continue to pay interest on a portion of the principal that has been paid back to the lender 7 How does tenure affect cost of loan The longer the tenure of the loan the lesser will be your monthly EMI outflow Shorter tenures mean greater EMI burden but your loan is repaid faster If you have a shortterm cash flow mismatch your bank may increase the tenure of the loan and your EMI burden comes down But longer tenures mean payment of larger interest towards the loan and make it more expensive 8 What is an amortization schedule This is a table that gives details of the periodic principal and interest payments on a loan and the amount outstanding at any point of time It also shows the gradual decrease of the loan balance until it reaches zero See annex 9 What is preEMI interest Sometimes loan is disbursed in installments depending on the stages of completion of the housing project Pending final disbursement you may be required to pay interest only on the portion of the loan disbursed This interest called preEMI interest PreEMI interest is payable every month from the date of each disbursement up to the date of commencement of EMI However many banks offer a special facility whereby customers can choose the installments they wish to pay for under construction properties till the time the property is ready for possession Anything paid over and above the interest by the customer goes towards Principal repayment The customer benefits by starting EMI payment earlier and hence repays the loan faster Please check with your banker whether this facility is available before availing of the loan 10 What security will you have to provide The security for a housing loan is typically a first mortgage of the property normally by way of deposit of title deeds Banks also sometimes ask for other collateral security as may be necessary Some banks insist on margin down payment borrowers contribution to the creation of an asset to be maintained made also Collateral security assigned to your bank could be life insurance policies the surrender value of which is set at a certain percentage to the loan amount guarantees from solvent guarantors pledge of shares securities and investments like KVP NSC etc that are acceptable to your banker Banks would also require you to ensure that the title to the property is free from any encumbrance ie there should not be any existing mortgage loan or litigation which is likely to affect the title to the property adversely 11 What precautions do you need to take if you are purchasing a property that is not a newly built one Ensure that the documents being provided to you are not colour photocopies Check the internet for other modus operandi to fraud and ensure clear title to the asset Seek advice only from authentic sources such as your bank Get the no encumbrance certificate to find the true title holder and if it is mortgaged to any financier Obtain all tax papers to ensure that all documents are up to date 12 What should be your strategy in dealing with the banks Give yourself comfortable time Do not hurry your purchase or loan in any case Shopping around for a home loan will help you to get the best financing deal Shopping comparing seeking clarification and negotiating with banks may save you thousands of rupees a Obtain information from several banks Home loans are available from mainly two types of lenderscommercial banks and housing finance companies Different lenders may quote you different rates of interest and other terms and conditions so you should contact several lenders to make sure youre getting the best value for money Find out how much of a down payment you are required to pay and find out all the costs involved in the loan including processing fees administrative charges and prepayment charges levied by banks Knowing just the amount of the EMI or the interest rate is not good enough Similarly ask for information on loan amount loan term and type of loan fixed or floating so that you can compare the information and take an informed decision The following is some important information that you will require i Rates Ask your lender about its current home loan interest rates and whether the rate is fixed or floating Remember that when interest rates in the economy go up so does the floating rates and hence the monthly repayment If the rate quoted is a floating rate ask how your rate and loan payment will vary including the extent to which your loan payment will be reduced when rates go down by a certain percentage Ask your lender to what index your floating home loan is referenced linked and the periodicity of updation of that index Also ask your bank whether the index is internal or external and how and where it is published Ask about the loans annual percentage rates APR The APR takes into account not only the interest rate but also fees and certain other charges that you may be required to pay expressed as a yearly rate Banks are obliged to reveal the APR if requested for by the customer ii Reset Clause Check the reset clause especially in the case of fixed interest rate loan as the rates will not be fixed throughout the tenure of the loan iii SpreadMark up Check if the margin in the case of the floating rate is fixed or variable The rate of interest you have to pay will vary accordingly iv Fees A home loan often requires payment of various fees such as loan origination or processing charges administrative charges documentation late payment changing the loan tenure switching to different loan package during the loan tenure restructuring of loan changing from fixed to floating interest rate loan and vice versa legal fee technical inspection fee recurring annual service fee document retrieval charges and prepayment charges if you want to prepay the loan Every lender should be able to give you an estimate of its fees Many of these fees are negotiable can be waived also Ask what each fee includes Sometimes several components are lumped into one fee Ask for an explanation of any fee you do not understand Also remember that most of these fees are perhaps negotiable Do negotiate with your bank before agreeing to a particular fee See how the all inclusive rate compares with the all inclusive rates offered by other banks While planning your finances dont forget to include the costs of stamp duty and registration v Down Payments Margin Some lenders require 2030 percent of the homes purchase price as a down payment from you However many lenders also offer loans that require less than 2030 percent down payment sometimes as little as 5 percent Ask about the lenders requirements for a down payment and also negotiate with him to reduce the down payments b Obtain the best deal Once you know what each bank has to offer in terms of rates fees and down payments negotiate for the best deal Ask the lender to write down all the costs associated with the loan Then ask if the bank will waive or reduce one or more of its fees or agree to a lower rate Do make sure that the bank is not agreeing to lower one fee while raising another or to lower the rate while raising the fees Ask for clarification in case you do not understand any particular term All banks are obliged to explain the most important terms and conditions of the home loan in detail Once you are satisfied with the terms you have negotiated please do obtain a written offer letter from the lender and keep a copy with you Read the offer letter carefully before signing 13 Can you repay your loan ahead of schedule Is prepayment of loan allowed Yes most banks allow you to repay the loan ahead of schedule by making lump sum payments However many banks charge early repayment penalties up to 23 of the principal amount outstanding Prepayment penalty may vary according to the reasons and source of funds if you obtain a loan from another bank for prepayment the charges are usually higher than when you pay from your own sources However you may credit more than your EMI amount into your loan account on a periodic basis and bring down your interest burden as and when funds are available with you Most banks do not charge a prepayment penalty if you deposit more than your EMI payable on a periodic basis Please check such stipulations while availing the loan 14 What are Switch over charges balances transfer charges When other banks reduce the interest rate you may prefer to close your account with the bank with whom you are banking to avail of the loan from the bank offering reduced rates of interest You have to pay prepayment charges for doing so In order to ensure that their customers do not approach other banks for availing reduced interest rates banks allow customers to switch over from a higher interest loan to a lower interest loan by paying a switch over fees which is lesser than the prepayment charges Generally switchover fee is taken as percentage of the outstanding loan amount Keep updating yourself on various changes in the home loan market Visit the branch discuss with the officials to get the best out of any changes in the home loan scenario 15 Do you get a tax benefit on the loan Yes Resident Indians are eligible for certain tax benefits on both principal and interest components of a loan under the Income Tax Act 1961 Under the current laws you are entitled to an income tax rebate for interest repayment up to Rs 150000 per annum Moreover you can get added tax benefits under Section 80 C on repayment of principal amount up to Rs 100000 per annum 16 What are the minimum standards that banks are required to follow when they sell you a home loan A bank cannot reject your loan application without furnishing valid reasons for the same 17 What do you do if you have a grievance If you have a complaint against only scheduled bank on any of the above grounds you can lodge a complaint with the bank concerned in writing in a specific complaint register provided at the branches as per the recommendation of the Goiporia Committee or on a sheet of paper Ask for a receipt of your complaint The details of the official receiving your complaint may be specifically sought If the bank fails to respond within 30 days you can lodge a complaint with the Banking Ombudsman Please note that complaints pending in any other judicial forum will not be entertained by the Banking Ombudsman No fee is levied by the office of the Banking Ombudsman for resolving the customers complaint A unique complaint identification number will be given to you for tracking purpose A list of the Banking Ombudsmen along with their contact details is provided on the RBI website Complaints are to be addressed to the Banking Ombudsman within whose jurisdiction the branch or office of the bank complained against is located

Ombudsman you can appeal to the Appellate Authority in the Reserve Bank of India REVERSE MORTGAGE LOAN 18 What is reverse mortgage loan What is my eligibility and how I will get back the title deeds The scheme of reverse mortgage has been introduced recently for the benefit of senior citizens owning a house but having inadequate income to meet their needs Some important features of reverse mortgage are Note Reverse mortgage is a fixed interest discounted product in reverse It does not take into account the changes in interest rates as yet Important This part is fine printed to help you practice reading the fine print The loan agreement documentation runs into nearly 50 pages and its language is complex If you thought everyone signs the same agreements with the bank where is the need to read You are not taking an informed decision If you thought somebody would have pointed this to me if there was any problem then maybe they did but you could not read or listen to it Think again Borrowers and lenders rights may not be expressed clearly in a transparent manner in all the loan agreements The home loan agreement may not be provided to you in advance so that this could be read and understood before you sign the agreement Every method may be used to delay handing over a copy to the borrower in sufficient time Some areas you may focus are a check the reset clause incorporated by some banks in their home loan agreements that allows them to change the interest rate in the future even on fixed rate loans Banks may set their reset clauses for 3 or 2 year intervals They say a lender cannot have an agreement that a fixed rate is set for the entire tenure of 15 to 20 years as this will cause an assetliability mismatch Talk to your bank b Please seek clarifications on the term exceptional circumstances if stated in the loan agreement under which loan rates can be unilaterally changed by your bank c A common person thinks that default ideally means nonpayment of one or more loan installments In some loan documentation it can include divorce and death in individual case and even involvement in civil litigation or criminal offence d Does the loan agreement say that disbursement of the loan may be made directly to the builder or developer and in the case of a readybuilt property to the vendor thereof andor in such other manner as may be decided solely by bank It is the borrower whose original property papers are retained with the bank so why disburse to the builder Possession of property has been delayed in some cases when the cheque was issued in the name of the builder and the builder refused to pay delay penalty to the borrower e Does the agreement enable assignment of your loan to a third party You take into account reputation and credibility of the bank before entering into a loan agreement with it Are you comfortable with third party takes over or should you also be allowed to move your home loan from one bank to another in that case Look for ambiguous clauses and discuss with the banker Some agreements say changes in employment etc have to be informed well in advance without quantifying the term well in advance f In one case the loan documentation says issuance of preapproval letter should not be construed as a commitment by the bank to grant the housing loan and processing fees is not refundable even if the home loan is not processed This is never ending it seems The above are only indicative instances of what has been observed reported indicated by various sources However our main objective was to get you into the habit of reading the fine print If you have read this you would have understood the importance of reading fine print in any document and we have achieved our objective I only wish I could have made the print smaller as in the real cases ANNEX EXAMPLE OF EMI CALCULATION PURE FIXED LOAN Amount of Loan 100000000 Annual Interest Rate 1500 Number of Payments 120 Monthly Payment 1613350 Number Payment

transmission as well as in allocation and absorption of risks entailed in financing Indias growth Good afternoon and Namaskar Thank you Alfred for those insightful opening remarks I must mention that Alfred led the IMFs Article IV India mission for the 2021 consultations The sheer weight of that experience and deep understanding of Indian conditions is reflected in his views I would also like to commend Alfred and his coeditors for a comprehensive evaluation of Indias financial system and very valuable recommendations on the way forward in a recent book evocatively titled Indias Financial System Building the Foundation for Strong and Sustainable Growth I am glad to see Mr Thomas Helbling from the Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF in this session and I look forward to hearing from him I thank our host and SEACEN EXCO Chair the National Bank of Cambodia the SEACEN Centre and Dr Mangal Goswami Executive Director and the BIS for inviting me to speak in this distinguished forum In particular I am grateful to Deputy Governor Sum Sannisith for so graciously writing to me to participate in this 16th SEACENBIS High Level Seminar The Backdrop It is widely believed that during the next two decades if not for longer the centre of gravity of the global economy will shift eastwards to Asia The IMFs Regional Economic Outlook for Asia and the Pacific indicates that this region will contribute about twothirds of global growth in 2023 itself India will account for a sixth of world output growth in 2023 and 2024 In terms of market exchange rates India is the fifth largest economy of the world and the third largest economy on the basis of purchasing power parity Our assessment is that by 2027 India will be a US 5 trillion economy and the third largest in the world even by market exchange rates A key driver in this transformation is likely to be the window of a demographic dividend that opened up in 2018 and will probably last till the 2040s going by fertility and mortality rates Already we are the most populous country in the world at 14 billion and the youngest at an average age of 28 years The other major catalyst of Indias progress will be the pace and quality of financial sector development which is the theme of my address today It is anchored by a few slides For a high saving rate economy like the rest of Asia a modern efficient and soundly functioning financial sector is essential for mobilising the resource requirements of Indias developmental aspirations A broad strand in the literature has established that financial sector development has positive multiplier effects on the real economy including by conferring productivity and allocational efficiency gains While the jury is still out on whether economic progress is financeled or demandfollowing in its sequence a wealth of empirical evidence points to Asias growth trajectory being that of the real economy leading financial development and India is no exception There is also stylized evidence that the composition of the financial sector across Asia is changing with hitherto bankdominated systems giving space to alternative financial intermediaries such as nonbanks and capital markets These developments in turn generate impulses of growth for the rest of the economy In India additional dimensions have opened up exciting possibilities for leveraging our growth potential the digital revolution transformation of the payment and settlement ecosystem and innovations in financial inclusion More recently Indias exponential expansion of the usage of space technology is reshaping every aspect of our lives including the financial sector Against this backdrop I thought that I would present some aspects of Indias financial sector as its poised today the quiet metamorphosis that has been taking place over the years and the main challenges and opportunities on the way forward Composition of Indias Financial sector In its broadest form the financial system comprises of banks that account for about 60 per cent of the total flow of credit to the nonfinancial sector nonbanking finance companies NBFCs that provide 8 per cent financial markets and others that account for 20 per cent and foreign sources that constitute 12 per cent The Reserve Bank of India RBI is responsible for the regulation supervision and development of banks NBFCs including longterm refinancing institutions primary dealers and housing finance companies and the money gilt foreign exchange and credit segments of the financial market spectrum In the rest of my remarks I shall focus on these parts of the financial sector There is an interregulatory Financial Stability and Development Council FSDC which has oversight over the entire financial system and coordination is secured by a subcommittee of the FSDC headed by the Governor of the RBI Banking Sector First let me turn to the banking system Typically Indias banking system is summarily described as preponderantly publicly owned and heavily public policy intervened In practice it is more vibrant with 12 public sector banks facing keen competition from 21 private banks 45 foreign banks and 63 niche banks2 catering to specific needs and clientele It is important to note that all constituents of the banking system are subjected to the same regulatory regime with specific modulations for the niche and local banks in terms of sources and uses of funds It is noteworthy that India has not faced a financial crisis of the scale and severity of the Asian crisis of 199798 or the Latin American crisis of 1980s and 2002 or the global financial crisis GFC of 200708 although its suffered knockon effects from each of them Financial perturbations have happened in India though but they were more local in character and essentially a manifestation of procyclical exuberance As the Indian economy emerged out of recessionary conditions in 200102 and an economic upswing took hold it spurred a credit boom to fund infrastructure expansion Masked by lax credit standards and opaque asset quality recognition it was punctured by the onset of the GFC India was among the earliest countries to bounce out of the GFC and aspirations of doubledigit growth fuelled another burst of bank creditled infrastructure and heavy industry investment On the premise that infrastructure involves long gestations bank loans were allowed to be restructured while treating them as standard advances in banks books with insufficient provisioning In 20152016 deep surgery in the form of asset quality review AQR was undertaken and the true quality of banks assets began to emerge With the proper recognition of restructured loans provisioning requirements especially of public sector banks surged A revised prompt corrective action PCA framework involving thresholds on capital asset quality profitability and leverage was imposed from 2017 in the form of restrictions on lending dividenddistribution and branch expansion apart from requirement of higher provisions At the peak 12 banks were placed under the framework A massive recapitalisation of US 42 billion3 was undertaken by the government during 20172022 The pain was severe but beneficial effects started to show up from 2018 resulting in improved asset quality the gross nonperforming assets ratio fell from a peak of 115 per cent in March 2018 to 39 per cent by March 2023 By 2022 all troubled banks had exited the PCA In recent years several regulatory and supervisory initiatives have strengthened the banking sector An Insolvency and Bankruptcy code IBC and the establishment of a National Asset Reconstruction company NARCL have created the institutional environment for addressing stress in banks balance sheets on an enduring basis Offsite surveillance systems have been made sharper and more comprehensive by harnessing SupTech a webbased endtoend workflow application called DAKSH and an automatic data reporting platform called the Centralised Information and Management System CIMS Big data techniques are being leveraged to supplement supervisory initiatives while Cyber Range a virtual controlled environment and tool helps in cyber security drills Mergers have brought in efficiency gains while a regulatory sandbox propels innovation Extension of depositor protection cover upfront payment of deposit insurance and the integration of various ombudsman schemes under one umbrella has made the dispute redressal mechanism simpler and more responsive all boosting public confidence in the banking system This unencumbering of banks balance sheets stood them in good stead through the ravages of the pandemic and more recently a virtuous credit upswing has taken root Singed by the earlier experiences we remain on high alert however and continuously monitor sectoral and institutionspecific credit expansion and underwriting standards for any sign of excessive risktaking From 2013 India had started the process of aligning with Basel III norms Capital requirements were set one per cent higher than the Basel III minimum including for common equity tier 1 CET1 In 2015 the capital conservation buffer CCB was introduced the last tranche of 0625 per cent was temporarily delayed during the pandemic but it was reinstated in October 2021 Guidelines for the countercyclical capital buffer have been issued to banks in 2015 but it has not been triggered yet as the credit gap remains negative The requirement of 100 per cent liquidity coverage ratio LCR was implemented in 2019 and banks have consistently maintained it at above the minimum requirement which is also the Basel III norm Since 2021 the net stable funding ratio has also been implemented The provision coverage ratio PCR has been steadily improving and as a result the net nonperforming assets ratio has declined to 1 per cent by March 2023 The confluence of balance sheet repair and the rebuilding of capital and liquidity buffers is reflected in a strong improvement in profitability from negative levels during 2018 and 2019 in terms of both return on assets and return on equity With the turning of the monetary policy cycle into tightening mode to fight inflation since May 2022 banks net interest margins NIMs have expanded due to fuller transmission to lending rates than to saving and current account CASA deposit rates a phenomenon that has been observed in many advanced economy AE banks during the period of synchronized monetary policy actions The widening of the NIMs has also been facilitated by the suffusion of liquidity from pandemicrelated measures which obviated the need for banks to garner deposits by offering attractive rates As I mentioned earlier bank credit is monitored as a lead indicator of overheating Our assessment based on a menu of approaches indicates that current rates of credit expansion are not pointing to systemic stress building up warning lights flash in the Indian context at growth rates of 1618 per cent Illustratively the credit gap the difference between the credit to GDP ratio and its trend is currently negative Furthermore NIMs in the banking system are averaging around 38 per cent which is ruling below the estimated threshold of 5 per cent beyond which it may have implications for financial stability due to loosening of leverage constraints and adverse selection Nonetheless eternal vigilance is the price of financial stability The current episode of bank credit expansion is led by retail loans Conventional wisdom suggests that these types of loans being diffused across a wide borrower base mitigate the accumulation of systemic risk all borrowers may not default together We are however watchful as herding by banks in the retail loan space might lead to potential cascades across the system if defaults do occur Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that all banks in India would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios The systemlevel capital ratio under the baseline medium and severe stress scenarios is projected at 161 per cent 147 per cent and 133 per cent respectively by March 2024 well above the regulatory minimum of 9 per cent Liquidity risk analysis conducted to capture the impact of any possible runon deposits shows that in an extreme scenario of sudden and unexpected withdrawals of around 15 per cent of uninsured deposits along with the utilisation of 75 per cent of unutilised portion of committed credit lines would reduce liquid assets at the system level from 211 per cent of total assets to 114 per cent but it would not turn negative Furthermore stress tests on banks credit concentration considering top individual borrowers according to their standard exposures show that even in the extreme scenario of the top three individual borrowers failing to repay no bank would face a drop in the capital ratio below the regulatory requirement of 9 per cent although two banks would see a decline in the capital ratio below the regulatory minimum inclusive of the CCB requirement 115 per cent The recent failure of few banks in some AEs jurisdictions showed how unprepared they were to manage the transition to rapid increases in interest rates by central banks which exposed fault lines in their balance sheets As interest rates rose unrealised valuation losses spiked in their heldtomaturity HTM portfolios which are not markedtomarket The aggregate valuation losses in the US banking system grew from US 8 billion at the end of 2021 to more than US 620 billion at the end of 2022 Sizable portfolios of uninsured deposits exacerbated the impact of unrealised valuation losses leading on bank runs Inadequate capital positions worsened their risk profiles in the chart the distance between blue and red dots shows the erosion of common equity tier 1 capital In the Indian context if a shock in the form of a 250 basis points parallel upward shift in the yield curve is applied the marktomarket impact on the HTM portfolio of banks excluding unrealised losses would reduce the system level capital ratio from 171 per cent in March 2023 to 137 per cent which is still above the regulatory requirement Digital Transformation The financial sector in India is on the cusp of a transformative change leveraged on technology The trinity of JAM Jan Dhan basic nofrills accounts Aadhaar universal unique identification and Mobile connections is bringing the hitherto excluded into the ambit of formal finance and is enabling the targeting of direct benefit transfers from the government to the beneficiaries Currently there are a record 500 million Jan Dhan beneficiaries out of which more than half are women Mobile internet subscription has increased sharply opening up avenues for innovative ebusiness models to augment access to financial services in the hinterland through efficient disbursal of egovernment services It is also boosting entrepreneurship by stimulating tech startups Indias Unified Payment Interface UPI an openended system that powers multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application of any participating bank is propelling interbank peertopeer and persontomerchant transactions seamlessly This payment revolution is attracting wide international interest In August 2023 the UPI crossed the milestone of recording more than 10 billion transactions a month In addition both large value and small value payment systems4 in India operate on a 24 by 7 by 365 basis NonBanking Financial Companies Connecting the Last Mile Another important segment of Indias financial system the nonbanking financial companies NBFCs have emerged as important intermediaries in Indias financial landscape because they connect the last mile and also provide an alternative to banks Unlike in other jurisdictions NBFCs are regulated by the RBI in a scalebased framework with banklike regulatory interventions Their widening presence is reflected in a rising credit to GDP ratio from 86 per cent to 123 per cent between 201213 and 202122 The sector has gone through periods of liquidity stress such as evaporation of market confidence in 201819 and again during the pandemic but it has emerged stronger and sounder Credit growth is in double digits and is supported by strong capital buffers and healthy balance sheets NBFCs rely heavily on borrowings to fund their activities with banks constituting around 41 per cent of their borrowings at endMarch 2023 Importantly around ninety per cent of bank lending is to NBFCs that are Arated and above Therefore contagion risk is limited System level stress tests for assessing the resilience of the NBFC sector to credit risk shocks under a baseline and two stress scenarios medium and high risk show that under the medium risk shock of a one standard deviation SD increase in the slippage ratio the GNPA ratio increases to 55 per cent The resulting income loss and additional provisional requirements reduce the CRAR by 60 basis points relative to the baseline Under the high risk shock of 2 SDs the capital adequacy ratio of the sector declines by 90 bps relative to the baseline to 235 per cent Financial Markets Just as NBFCs complement banks as a source of finance financial markets are another important source of resource mobilisation Led by banking and financial sector stocks Indias equity markets are outperforming the MSCI Emerging Market index Indias share in the MSCI has increased from 65 per cent in 2012 to 149 per cent by August 2023 reflecting the brightening economic outlook and raising expectations of attracting higher passive investments Indias 12months forward price to earnings PE ratio is the highest in the world reflecting the premium on Indias growth story Equity market volatility VIX in India has remained largely stable and lower in comparison to peers India is the largest recipient of Foreign Portfolio investments FPI inflows among the comparable EMEs during AprilJuly 2023 In the bond markets the yield curve is flattening but has not inverted as in other countries reflecting anchored expectations on Indias growth prospects as well as a certain degree of insulation from global spillovers The Indian rupee is among the most stable currencies in the world during 2023 up to September 11 the 1month implied volatility of the INR decreased to 408 per cent from 522 per cent during the same period in 2022 INR volatility measured by the coefficient of variation has remained the lowest among major AEs and EMEs Exchange rate stability is regarded as an important element of financial stability Conclusion In conclusion the approach to the financial sector in India is reflecting a new paradigm in which macroeconomic and financial stability are seen as strongly complementary and providing the foundation for mediumterm growth prospects Prudence is taking precedence over exuberance and this is reflected in the steady buildup of all types of buffers In an overarching sense this approach is reflected in the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves which as our experience has shown has become our national safety net in the absence of a truly global financial shield Besides providing the wherewithal to protect our financial markets and institutions from being overwhelmed by global spillovers the reserves have helped to build bulwarks of external strength as reflected in modest external debt servicing and debt to GDP ratios We believe that this is strengthening our capability to manage new challenges such as climate change and cyber threats

as well as in allocation and absorption of risks entailed in financing Indias growth Dr Sanjay Bahl Director General of Computer Emergency Response Team In CERTIn distinguished guests from the IMF the BIS delegates from other central banks and CERTs MDsCEOs of banks from India and their team members global CISOs and CTOs of foreign banks my colleagues from RBI ladies and gentlemen Good morning to all of you 2 I thank all of you for joining us for this important event to deliberate upon the critical area of cyber security that has become increasingly pertinent in our rapidly evolving digital age As financial transactions migrate to digital platforms the reliance on information technology infrastructure grows exponentially While this shift brings undeniable convenience and efficiency it also exposes us to increasing risks Cyber criminals driven by malicious intent and motivated by financial gain continually exploit vulnerabilities in digital systems seeking to breach security defences and gain unauthorized access to valuable data 3 In an interconnected world where financial transactions traverse continents in a matter of seconds the need for international cooperation in combating cyber threats has become paramount Cyberattacks targeting banks not only jeopardize the stability of individual institutions but also have the potential to disrupt financial systems making it imperative for nations to come together and address this pressing challenge Therefore this event under Indias G 20 Presidency is important to complement efforts of various international bodies for addressing the issues of cyber security in the banking sector Importance of Technology 4 Technology has been a driving force in shaping the financial sector enabling greater efficiency accessibility and affordability However the current FinTech revolution is unique in many ways being defined by increased computing power and use of new technologies Further there is an emergence of new entrants and innovative business models 5 Previously digitalisation of financial services allowed banks and financial institutions to have structured data on their consumers which was used to have an understanding of the customers risk profile However with the emergence of Big Data analytics even better insights on customer preferences and behaviour can be obtained using alternate semistructured and unstructured data 6 Data is often referred to as the new oil due to its immense value and potential for driving economic growth innovation and the positive impact it can have when used responsibly However when used irresponsibly several negative consequences follow such as privacy violations identity theft and frauds manipulation using targeted advertisements etc In fact irresponsible data usage not only poses risks to individuals but undermines trust in the digital ecosystem and may even have financial stability and national security implications Understanding Financial Stability Vulnerabilities 7 Understanding financial stability vulnerabilities emerging from cyber perspective is critical because existing capital and liquidity prescriptions may not mitigate the effect of a cyber event the same way they mitigate financial losses For instance capital and liquidity can provide the financial resources to respond to a cyber incident but may not speed up the process of recovering systems or data 8 Cyberattacks can disrupt critical financial operations within banks rendering them unable to process transactions access customer accounts or execute essential functions This disruption can result in a loss of confidence in the banking system as customers and businesses may face difficulties in accessing their funds or conducting normal financial activities Such disruptions can lead to financial instability especially if they affect multiple banks or are prolonged 9 Enhancements in service offerings such as longer operating hours of payment systems and shorter clearing and settlement windows leave the financial system with fewer service breaks in which operations can be restored after a cyber incident Uncertainty about the nature and extent of an incident may also prompt runs on counterparties competitors or unaffected segments of the financial entitys operations 10 Indeed the 2021 ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline though not a financial entity highlighted the interconnectedness of critical infrastructure systems and the potential cascading effects on various sectors including banking It illustrated how a cyberattack could spark a run in this case a runon gas stations amplifying the effects well beyond the original shock 11 While there is extensive ongoing supervisory attention to entitylevel cyber resilience data gaps remain At the entity level there is need for consistent data on cyber incidents At the system level relevant data measures of digital interdependencies and the speed with which backup systems can be quickly enabled are required Cyber Security and Digital Financial Inclusion 12 Cyber risks can have a significant impact on financial inclusion efforts as well Financial inclusion aims to provide access to financial services for the underserved and marginalized populations and rapid strides have been made in this area facilitated by digital public infrastructures However these populations are more vulnerable to cyber risks due to their lack of awareness about cybersecurity 13 Individuals can lose trust if they are brought online in the name of financial inclusion only to be exposed to cyber harms that they cannot recover from For digital financial inclusion to be successful it is not enough to bring people into the digital economy All the stakeholders must also ensure that people are resilient against the risks they will be likely exposed to Indian Perspective 14 I would like to take this opportunity to share the Indian perspective While encouraging innovation and digitization of financial products and services RBIs approach has been to ensure that innovation should be assimilated in the financial system in a nondisruptive manner and the course of digitisation should ensure customer protection at every step 15 India is one of the few countries that protects users through the mandate of twofactor authentication for digital payment transactions Although it is now recognised as an innovative regulation at the time when RBI introduced it about a decade back there was a pushback and criticism Similarly the recent measures such as better customer control on card usage shorter TurnAroundTimes for transaction failures tokenisation etc are all initiatives intended to protect the customer 16 In the Payments space Real Time Gross Settlement RTGS and National Electronic Fund Transfer NEFT have been made 24x7 Further RBI catalysed the setting up of appropriate institutions like the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology IDRBT in 1996 and the National Payment Corporation of India in 2008 which have been instrumental in pioneering various payment system technologies and solutions 17 Through appropriate regulatory frameworks the RBI has encouraged innovations in Digital Lending Open Banking and P2P lending platforms A Regulatory Sandbox framework was created in 2019 which has run several cohorts to incentivise adoption of innovative financial products and services The Reserve Bank Innovation Hub RBIH has been set up for collaborating with financial sector institutions the technology industry and academic institutions for exchange of ideas and development of prototypes related to financial innovations Competitive events like the Hackathons are held to provide a channel for the fintech and startup sector to showcase innovations 18 The supportive regulatory environment with its focus on safety speed and scalability has positioned India as a leader in payment system innovation Illustratively UPI Indias instant payment system launched in 2016 has witnessed remarkable growth in India with daily transactions averaging over 300 million in volume and 480 billion in value during May 2023 Recently India and Singapore tied up their UPI and Pay Now systems allowing for real time cross border money transfers between the two countries Indeed there is immense potential for use of UPI globally through partnership and collaboration with other countries 19 The RBI is also continuously trying to strengthen its supervisory oversight over cyber risks Simulated phishing cyber reconnaissance and other cyber exercises complement supervisory processes in getting a systemic view of the prevailing cyber risks RBI has also encouraged development of innovative tools like the Sectoral Security Operations Centre SSOC which can help address the cyber risk of the banking and financial sector in a major way 20 Though cyber risks are said to outpace regulations the Reserve Bank of India has been proactively taking measures to strengthen IT and Cyber Risk management in its regulated entities As early as 2011 detailed guidelines for managing IT risks were issued to the banks followed by a principlesbased Cyber Security Framework in 2016 Regulations have also been issued on Digital Payment Security Controls and on Outsourcing of IT Services RBI has also published draft guidelines on IT Governance which shall be finalised and issued shortly Need for collective effort 21 Considering the global nature of cyber threats efforts by governments financial entities and technological companies are insufficient to protect against them Cyber threats transcend geographical boundaries making it necessary for countries and financial institutions to work together to address them 22 I would like to outline six strategies that would help improve the global cyber security environment Firstly the global financial systems interdependencies need to be better understood by mapping key operational and technological interconnections including that of critical infrastructure Better incorporation of cyber risk into financial stability analysis will improve the ability to understand and mitigate systemwide risk Secondly a minimum common framework for cybersecurity needs to be devised that outlines best practices and standards for financial institutions to follow This can help ensure that all institutions are taking the necessary steps to protect themselves from cyber threats Thirdly to the extent feasible as per domestic laws countries can share information and intelligence about cyber threats and attacks This can help to identify emerging threats and vulnerabilities and enable financial institutions take proactive measures to prevent attacks Fourthly countries can work together to develop and implement incident response plans This can help to ensure that in the event of a cyberattack there is a coordinated and effective response that minimizes the impact on the financial sector Fifthly cyberattacks should become more expensive and riskier for the perpetrators through effective measures to confiscate proceeds of crime and prosecute criminals Stepping up international efforts to prevent disrupt and deter attackers would reduce the threat at its source Finally countries can collaborate on capacity building and training programs to ensure that financial institutions have the necessary skills and resources to manage cyber risks effectively This can include training on cybersecurity best practices incident response planning and the use of advanced technologies to detect and prevent cyberattacks Conclusion 23 Let me now conclude With growing interconnections across the world curbing cyber risk requires an international effort It is expected that the G20 forum would complement the efforts of various international bodies towards building an approach for helping financial sector through capacity development initiatives aimed at designing and implementing international standards and best practices as a priority 24 I request all to participate actively in the upcoming cyber security exercise that will be held today Together we can make the financial sector more secure and trustworthy Thank you
https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1362&fn=6,Date FutureProofing the Indian Financial System,Wellfunctioning liquid and resilient financial markets help monetary policy transmission as well as in allocation and absorption of risks entailed in financing Indias growth I am very happy to be here among researchers and practitioners to participate in the Global Conference on Financial Resilience organised by the College of Supervisors of the Reserve Bank of India I would like to convey my appreciations to the College of Supervisors CoS for organising this conference I also congratulate the CoS for its accomplishments over the last two years 2 In the context of the overall impact of the COVID19 pandemic the war in Ukraine and the recent banking sector events in the US and Europe on the financial sector there is now renewed focus on issues of financial resilience and stability Regulators and Governments across the world are now looking at these aspects with greater intensity Adequacy of the existing regulations and supervisory systems are under fresh assessment In this background a global conference on financial resilience is very appropriate and timely 3 The financial sector in a country and the individual entities therein like banks nonbanking financial companies NBFCs and other entities have to be resilient at all times They should have the inner strength to withstand even the most stressful times So far as India is concerned the Reserve Bank of India has significantly strengthened its regulations and supervision of banks and other regulated entities in recent years Our approach has been to enhance the resilience as well as the robustness of the financial sector so that individual entities effectively withstand stressful situations and continue to contribute to the process of economic development of the country In my address today I propose to highlight the expectations of the Reserve Bank of India from the stakeholders in the Indian financial system 4 In most economies central banks act as custodians of financial stability Central banks are also empowered to act as a lender of last resort during financial crises This historical function of providing emergency liquidity assistance to banks and other financial market institutions necessitates that central banks keep a close watch on banks and financial markets for signs of instability if any Moreover monetary policy is implemented largely through banks and financial markets The transmission of monetary policy to the real economy depends crucially on the smooth functioning of the financial markets as well as financial intermediaries like banks and NBFCs It is in this context that the key and complementary functions of central banks such as setting of interest rates liquidity management regulation and supervision over the banking and other segments of the financial sector become more pronounced These functions work together to support economic growth by maintaining financial stability and promoting responsible behaviour among financial institutions 5 Let me now specifically turn to the concept of resilience which is the theme of todays conference Systemic resilience depends both on the resilience of individual financial institutions as well as on the interdependencies among them 6 A resilient future ready bank needs to be financially operationally and organisationally resilient To be financially resilient a bank should have adequate capital buffers and be able to generate earnings even in times of severe macroeconomic shocks It should also have adequate liquidity to meet its obligations in various situations Therefore financial resilience is closely linked to a banks business model and strategy The Reserve Bank has therefore started looking at the business models of banks more closely Aspects or deficiencies in the business model itself can spark a crisis in due course We have not only prescribed regulatory norms for capital adequacy and liquidity ratios but even gone beyond to nudge banks to build up capital buffers in good times and times of plenty We did this during the COVID19 pandemic when there was plenty of liquidity the interest rates were low and the full impact of the pandemic on the financial sector was still highly uncertain 7 The Reserve Bank has also put in place various prudential regulatory frameworks These include capital adequacy requirements asset classification and provisioning requirements dividend distribution framework and liquidity management framework In addition the Reserve Bank also periodically deploys macroprudential measures to address system level buildup of risks As a consequence of the measures taken by both the Reserve Bank and the banks themselves the Indian banking system has remained resilient and has not been affected adversely by the recent sparks of financial instability seen in some advanced economies This also comes out clearly in our recent stress test results 8 The Gross NPA ratio for the Scheduled Commercial Banks SCBs was 441 per cent at end December 2022 down from 58 per cent as on March 31 2022 and 73 per cent as on March 31 2021 The CRAR at 161 per cent at end December 2022 is also much above the minimum regulatory requirement Macro stress tests for credit risk indicate that SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios 9 Nevertheless the recent events in the banking landscape of the US and Europe suggest that risks for an individual bank could crop up from segments of its balance sheet which might have been considered relatively safer Hence we expect the management and Board of Directors of each bank to continually assess the financial risks and focus on building up adequate capital and liquidity buffers even beyond the regulatory minimum for continued resilience and sustainable growth 10 Let me now focus on operational resilience This would mean that a bank should be able to deliver critical services even in the face of disruptions Cyber risks and possible cyberattacks are on top of the list so far as such disruptions are concerned 11 Cyber risk has been identified as the foremost in top ten operational risks for 2023 based on a global survey1 of financial institutions The Bank for International Settlements BIS while revising the Principles for Sound Management of Operational Risk in 2021 introduced a specific principle on Information and Communications Technology ICT risk management reflecting the importance of this risk Robust IT and information security governance would help in increased predictability and reduction of uncertainty in operations minimise losses from information security related incidents and enhance operational resilience Given the extensive level of outsourcing being done by the banks and also by other regulated entities there is even greater need for ensuring that effective policies and practices are in place in this regard Even the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors are focusing on risks arising from third party dependencies The RBI has taken a slew of measures in the recent years with usage of advanced analytical and surveillance tools along with techniques like phishing simulation and cyber reconnaissance exercises to push for enhanced IT and cyber security governance processes in banks and other supervised entities In the context of the growing exposure of Regulated Entities REs to various risks from dependency on thirdparties which provide technology and ITenabled services the Reserve Bank has recently on April 10 2023 issued comprehensive guidelines on Information Technology outsourcing2 by banks NBFCs and other REs 12 The third component of resilience for banks and other financial institutions is to be organisationally resilient so that they anticipate risks early and absorb them efficiently Organisations must have the capacity and resilience to protect themselves from adverse incidents and shield their balance sheets To achieve organisational resilience REs need to continuously evolve by standardising policies processes organisational culture and governance They must also be flexible enough to encourage diverse ideas and innovations within the organisation Pillars of Reserve Banks Regulatory and Supervisory Strategy 13 An important element in our strategy of making the Indian financial system including the banking system future ready is the robust and enhanced regulatory and supervisory framework we have put in place in the last few years Our present approach to regulation and supervision has been built essentially on three pillars 14 First one of our focus areas in recent years has been to strengthen governance and assurance functions within the Regulated Entities The safety and soundness of the banking system relies critically on effective governance so that the interest of all stakeholders especially the depositors are safeguarded The essence of good governance is to build an environment of trust transparency and accountability Depositors whose money represents an overwhelming part of banks resources keep their life savings and hardearned money with the banks Protection of depositors money is therefore a sacred duty which has to be fulfilled through good governance There cannot be any compromise on this The Reserve Bank is very particular that the Regulated Entities have systems and processes that promote sound corporate governance The assurance functions ie risk management compliance and internal audits in banks are critical links between governance and business Assurance functions assist the Board as well as the senior management in gauging whether the business operations of the bank or NBFC are being run in conformity with the policies and strategies laid down by the Board The Reserve Bank has issued detailed guidelines for ensuring quality and independence of the governance and assurance functions These areas are also subjected to intensive supervisory assessment 15 Second we have devoted our efforts to identifying and addressing the root causes of the vulnerabilities Many a times vulnerabilities arise from inappropriate business models adopted by banks and other financial entities Overaggressive growth strategies or mindless pursuit of bottomlines for instance are often a precursor to future problems While we do not interfere with business decision making Regulated Entities must demonstrate adequacy of internal controls and loss absorption capacity to match the risks that their business models may generate Our approach is to flag deficiencies in this area to the senior management or to the Board of Directors of individual institutions for remedial action We also remain engaged with external auditors and flag issues that are relevant for their role as the third line of defence In recent times our focus on root cause has led us to mandate certain housekeeping hygiene such as automated identification of nonperforming loans and provisioning proper checks and balances in the use of Internal and Office accounts implementation of Early Warning Systems EWS for preventing frauds and a host of IT and cybersecurity related controls among others 16 Third within the Reserve Bank we have considerably strengthened our supervisory analytics We are increasingly employing data analytics both macro and micro to capture potential and emerging risks identify outlier entities and the vulnerable large exposures of banks Our onsite supervisors deep dive into areas redflagged by offsite supervision teams We are now focusing on the adoption of advanced analytical based technological solutions including Artificial IntelligenceMachine Learning AI and ML for strengthening the internal supervisory processes 17 We have a system of early warning signals that provide lead indications of risk buildup Stress tests are also carried out on a continuous basis These stress tests not only cover individual entities but also capture the system level stress 18 While asset quality and capital position indicate resilience and robustness of financial institutions in the medium term liquidity is often seen as the immediate cause of crisis We monitor liquidity position of our entities very closely and aberrations if any are immediately taken up with the supervised entities for remedial measures Thus our whole approach to Supervision has been proactive for minimising surprises spotting concerns and addressing vulnerabilities early 19 In essence the unification of supervisory architecture within the Reserve Bank ie combining the supervisory processes of commercial banks NBFCs and urban cooperative banks UCBs into an integrated Department of Supervision ownershipagnostic and riskfocused supervision a shift from episodic to continuous supervision enhanced offsite surveillance leveraging on data analytics and SupTech solutions strengthened onsite supervision root cause analysis of problems and identification of outlier entities and deepdive into vulnerable areas have been the major planks of our supervisory strategy 20 The Reserve Bank has also taken several regulatory initiatives in recent years to strengthen governance risk management audit and compliance functions in NBFCs and UCBs These include the new scale based regulatory framework for NBFCs issued in October 2021 and the revised regulatory framework for UCBs issued in July 2022 Even before these new regulatory frameworks were brought in we had taken measures such as issuance of guidelines on appointment of Chief Risk Officers CROs and Chief Compliance OfficersCCOs in large NBFCs Liquidity coverage ratios for NBFCs with asset size of 5000 crore and above riskbased internal audit RBIA norms for large NBFCs with asset size of 5000 crore and above and UCBs with asset size of 500 crore and above and harmonising the guidelines on appointment of statutory auditors for NBFCs and UCBs with that of commercial banks Importance of Effective Internal and External Audits 21 I would now like to touch upon the criticality of effective internal and external audits for financial institutions It is no secret that stability and growth of an economy and financial markets are dependent upon trust among stakeholders To be future ready banks and financial institutions need to earn the trust of their current as well as prospective customers One cannot take the trust for granted With greater openness of the economy and faster transmission of information and capital flows on account of advent of technology it has become even more necessary to ensure credibility and confidence in the system Towards this cause a robust assurance mechanism by way of internal audit is essential to provide independent evaluation and assurance to the stakeholders that the operations of a Regulated Entity are being performed in accordance with the prescribed policies and procedures Statutory auditors also play a vital role in maintaining market confidence on audited financial statements In banking industry this public role is particularly relevant for financial stability given that banks hold public deposits Audit quality is key to the effectiveness of such public role For these reasons the Reserve Bank as the supervisor has a keen interest in the functioning of statutory auditors of the Regulated Entities Wherever necessary we engage with the external statutory auditors on issues of critical nature in individual banks and financial entities 22 We have recently revised the guidelines for statutory branch audits of Public Sector Banks PSBs according to which a minimum of 70 of credit exposure of a bank is required to be covered From FY 202324 onwards the Board of Directors of PSBs will decide on the coverage of branch audit and selection of branches While doing so the Boards are required to keep in mind the specific characteristics of individual banks like the banks business and risk profile geographical spread degree of centralisation of processes etc We expect the Boards of banks to exercise the highest level of diligence while deciding on these issues As regards statutory branch audit of Private Sector Banks PVBs we are doing a fresh assessment of the quality and coverage of such audits Skill and capacity building in the Reserve Bank 23 In the Reserve Bank we attach a lot of importance to skill building and capacity development of our employees We have been strengthening the Department of Supervision both in number and quality This is important as effective supervision requires specialised skills and mature judgement In this context we expect the College of Supervisors to keep on improving its training methodologies adopt more case studybased teaching have more practical sessions in its training programmes and develop objective assessment of the impact of its training interventions The feedback received from trainees may be used to improve programme content and fill the gaps identified The training programmes may also strike a balance between teaching hard technical skills and promoting soft skills such as leadership decision making time management and conflict resolution 24 The rapid developments and innovations in the financial system especially in the areas of fintech and digital products pose new opportunities as well as risks These may affect financial intermediation payment systems cyber security and consumer protection We have to continue monitoring and assessing the implications of these emerging trends while also developing our own capabilities and frameworks to effectively respond to these challenges 25 In recent times we have seen a proliferation of digital lending by NBFCs FinTechs and loan apps Such lending also brought with it certain challenges especially with regard to fair practices and consumer protection To address these challenges the Reserve Bank has laid down comprehensive guidelines for digital lending in September 2022 These guidelines aim to ensure that lending activities are conducted by the REs and their partners such as Loan Service Providers LSPs in a prudent fair transparent and responsible manner Conclusion 26 To sum up the Reserve Bank remains committed to futureproofing the Indian financial system and provide the required support for sustainable growth I am confident that this Global Conference on Financial Resilience organised by the College of Supervisors with participation of experts from India and abroad will add considerable value to the body of knowledge in the area of resilient financial systems I have been informed that many research papers on identified themes have been received and select papers have been made part of the maiden issue of the Journal of Financial Resilience which was released today I am sure the deliberations during the Conference would provide a lot of food for thought and bring new perspectives on the evolution of financial regulation and supervision I wish the conference all success Thank you 1 Source RiskNet 2 Master Direction on

transmission as well as in allocation and absorption of risks entailed in financing Indias growth A very good evening to all of you It is indeed a pleasure to be here and participate in the 31st annual management convention of Thrissur Management Association As Socrates once said The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing Little did we know three years back that we would face one of the greatest challenges of our lifetime a pandemic that would upend our daily lives and force us to navigate through unknown unforeseen and unanticipated turbulences As we complete a tad over three years after the onset of the pandemic it might be an opportune moment to reminisce about the challenges and responses to the COVID times as well as stocktake some of the lessons learnt What comes to mind in the first place is that the uncertainty and upheavals seen during the last three years has been a first for this living generation To dwell on the experiences challenges and responses let me begin by focussing on the global economic recovery post pandemic as well as in our country and thereafter briefly outline my views on the changes that pandemic brought in the financial world and what this transformation means for the Indian growth story going forward Restoration and Revitalization of the Economy The stress induced by Covid was different from any other stress the world has seen before The pandemic spread rapidly and affected almost every country in the world For financial regulators it was an outofsyllabus situation as the economic stress this time was not caused by underlying economic imbalances or financial market failures but by a public health crisis This made it a unique shock as it impacted both the supply and demand sides of the economy affecting both production and consumption The impact was such that global GDP contracted by 352 in 2020 Indias GDP contracted by 583 in the financial year 202021 making it the worst economic contraction in countrys history The recession was highly synchronized more than 90 per cent of economies even higher than the proportion of about 85 per cent of countries in recession at the height of the Great Depression of 1930324 witnessed a recession The Governments and Central Banks around the world responded with unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy measures both conventional and unconventional to support individuals businesses and financial markets This included massive stimulus packages quantitative easing and other measures to sustain credit flows and economic activity As per IMF estimates by mid2021 global economic stimulus in response to Covid reached 16 trillion including additional government spending revenue foregone and liquidity measures5 which amounts to close to 20 of global GDP To combat the impact of the COVID19 pandemic and to revive economic growth India announced a special economic and comprehensive package amounting to about Rs 271 lakh crore more than 13 per cent of Indias GDP6 The Governments actions were complemented through various measures deployed by the Reserve Bank within days of Covid being declared as a pandemic by WHO The repo rate was reduced cumulatively by 115 bps between March and May 2020 and CRR was reduced by 1 percentage point on March 27 2020 for one year to ease immediate liquidity constraints To further augment systemic liquidity longterm repo operations LTROs and targeted longterm repo operations TLTROs were undertaken A calibrated set of regulatory measures were also announced to provide relief from the pandemic These measures included moratorium on term loans for six months deferment of interest on working capital facilities sanctioned in the form of cash credit overdraft easing of working capital financing etc The measures taken by the Government and the RBI helped cushion the economy from the adverse effects of the pandemic and also demonstrated our commitment to support the businesses and individuals during the turbulence The RBIs measures to provide liquidity support to the economy helped ease the funding constraints faced by financial markets and enabled them to continue their operations and meet their financial obligations thereby supporting economic activity The governments push for providing relief to weaker sections and hardest hit sectors of the economy ensured that their immediate concerns were addressed The following year ie in FY22 the Indian economy started to recover despite the Omicron wave of January 2022 Consequently output in FY22 went past its prepandemic level in FY207 with the Indian economy staging an impressive recovery Just as India and the world were expecting to recover from the pandemic the geopolitical upheavals in Europe exacerbated existing pandemic related stress disrupting the commodities markets in particular The turmoil led to increased prices and volatility in fuel food grains fertilizers natural gas and metal prices leading to a worldwide surge in inflation The impact on commodities market can be gauged from the fact that the yearonyear growth in the prices as of March 2022 was 400 for natural gas 250 for coal 76 for crude 30 for food and approximately 120 for fertilizers8 These increased prices led to multidecade high inflation in many advanced economies The inflation reached 10 in Euro Area Germany and UK9 In India also inflation reached 78 in April 2022 before easing to 57 in December 202210 Central Banks across economies led by US Fed Reserve responded with synchronised policy rate hikes to curb high inflation Since May 2022 US has hiked policy rates by 450 bps while UK and the EU have increased rates by 300 bps The conflict in Europe necessitated a revision in expectations for economic growth and inflation in FY23 Despite the downward revision the growth estimate for FY23 for India is higher than for almost all major economies IMF estimates India to be one of the top two fastgrowing significant economies in 2022 Despite protracted global headwinds and tighter monetary conditions India is still expected to display a healthy growth and it is a testament to Indias underlying economic resilience and of our ability to recoup renew and reenergise the growth drivers of the economy The first advance estimates FAE released by the National Statistical Office NSO on January 6 2023 placed Indias real gross domestic product GDP growth at 70 per cent yearonyear yoy for 202223 driven by private consumption and investment Bank credit growth yoy stood at 168 per cent in December 2022 as compared with 84 per cent a year ago Aggregate deposits increased by 103 per cent yoy in December 2022 as compared with 96 per cent a year ago led by 132 per cent growth in term deposits11 The government has continued on the path of fiscal consolidation in the Union Budget 202324 by reprioritising expenditure mix The fiscal deficit is estimated to be 64 for the current fiscal and is likely to fall to 59 in the next fiscal Tax revenues have remained buoyant with monthly GST collections crossing 15 lakh crore in January 202312 This makes India the fastestgrowing economy in the world and today we are referred to as bright spot on a dark horizon To conclude the first part of my talk I would say that indeed amidst the challenges and uncertainties prevailing over the past three years Indian economy and financial system has shown remarkable resilience and strength New horizons Partnerships and Priorities Moving on let me focus on the transformative journey of Indian banking sector during past few years and specially during COVID period and how it is poised for supporting the Indian growth story The last decade has witnessed significant penetration of banking in the country Under Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana PMJDY 4820 crore beneficiary accounts have been opened so far with outstanding balance of 189 lakh crore in these accounts13 As of June 2022 there are more than 16 lakh bank branches translating to approximately 15 branches per 1 lakh of population This is further complemented by a network of 217 lakh ATMs14 out of which 47 per cent are in rural and semiurban areas Additionally there are close to 32 lakh Banking Correspondents BCs engaged by banks15 providing last mile access As of 2021 78 per cent of Indian adults population with 15 years or more of age had a bank account as compared to 53 per cent in 201416 Banking services have been made accessible to every village within a 5 km radius in 25 states and 7 Union Territories covering 9994 per cent of villages17 This has been supplemented by a few important developments which got a fillip during covid The first noteworthy development is the increasing use of technology in finance Technology in finance has been an important enabler that has empowered us to create a more inclusive and efficient financial ecosystem Banks have been innovating and enhancing the quality and reach of their services using technological solutions for some time now However this got accelerated during the COVID period when mobility became a challenge and technology came to the rescue for fulfilling all our banking needs The demands placed by the circumstances compelled banks and financial institutions to rethink their business processes and review their strategies The Reserve Bank also facilitated banks and financial institutions in this journey by issuing appropriate guidelines such as use of Video KYC However all this was made possible through the giant strides taken by our country in building a public digital infrastructure with India Stack coupled with JanDhan Aadhar Mobile the socalled JAM trinity Account Aggregator framework and other digital initiatives it enabled a decisive entry of the country into a digital finance era What makes India Stack unique is the scale public accessibility and the comprehensiveness that has helped in making a building a more inclusive digital economy The second important development to my mind during this period was the emergence of new partnerships between FinTech companies and banks Banks are seen leveraging technological partnerships with FinTechs in various ways to provide better products and better serve their customers In this partnership FinTechs can contribute their technology expertise while banks bring their domain expertise By leveraging technologies such as chatbots mobile apps and personalized digital solutions banks can provide customers with more convenient and seamless banking experiences This collaboration allows banks to enhance their digital capabilities and meet the expectations of techsavvy customers All of us have realised or experienced that in the post pandemic world digital lending has grown exponentially including in India leading to both an increase in scale and velocity of credit However at the same time it has also given rise to a host of business conduct issues This poses a regulatory dilemma as the Regulator then needs to play a balancing act in weighing the benefits brought in by innovative business models on one side and emerging business conduct and regulatory concerns on the other side An attempt has been made by the Reserve Bank to address this issue through issuing principlebased guidelines on digital lending The third important development was the reinforcement of our focus regarding the importance of inclusiveness The desperate times reminded us that even a small help at an appropriate time could make a world of difference to the person in need Therefore the Reserve Bank has accelerated its efforts towards building an inclusive financial system where access to financial services is not limited to a basic bank account but everyone has access to formal channels of credit and they are able to use their banking account to make digital payments to everyone everywhere every time This audience must be aware about the fact that today Indias payment systems are among the best in the world with our real time fast retail payment system UPI enabling transactions of about Rs 12 lakh crore per month in value and almost 26 crore transactions in daily volume The next thing which can revolutionise the credit markets is the credit decisions which are informed by availability of financial as well as alternate data By leveraging data analytics financial institutions are able to gain insights into customer behaviour market trends and emerging risks enabling them to make more informed credit decisions Datadriven finance is not just about collecting and analysing information its about using that information to drive innovation create value for customers and build sustainable resilient financial models to the benefit of the system To enable responsible use of data RBI has introduced the Account Aggregator framework which enable customers to control their data and provide permission for it to be shared with thirdparty service providers for provision of various financial products and services seamlessly It is expected that AA framework would accelerate the development of alternative lending models such as cash flowbased lending and marketplace lending or what we popularly known as peertopeer lending This would enable small businesses including street vendors that may not have traditional collateral to secure a loan As technology continues to advance we expect more innovative models to emerge that leverage data automation and artificial intelligence to transform the lending landscape A Fourth development post pandemic is the reminder to us the regulators to keep the financial stability as the prime point of focus The COVID shock termed as The Great Lockdown18 by the IMF put all stress testing models and business continuity plans to test It also reminded us that the financial system is vulnerable to shocks arising in any sector external as well as internal and it is an imperative for us to take steps to ensure financial stability For modern economies financial stability is not just a goal its a necessity for when it falters the ripple effects can bring down even the mightiest to their knees The 2008 financial crisis was a stark reminder that financial stability isnt just an ideal its a prerequisite for a wellfunctioning economy Banks are the backbone of the financial system and they play a significant role in ensuring financial stability For this reason the banks are required to comply with the prudential regulations issued by the Reserve Bank and are required to maintain sufficient capital buffers to absorb losses The other crucial element of financial stability is robust governance Robust governance is the cornerstone of stability and prosperity of any organisation safeguarding the integrity and ensuring that all decisions are taken in the best interest of stakeholders Recognising this the Reserve Bank has always placed greater importance on governance and has taken several measures to strengthen the same in banks The Reserve Banks guidelines now require banks to have a diverse and independent board of directors with a mix of executive and nonexecutive directors with certain minimum qualifications and experience The oversight from Board of Directors must be supported by robust risk management audit and compliance functions Future Challenges and Opportunities Although we have come a long way in our quest for providing banking for all there is still a long path to traverse The huge gap in availability and utilisation of financial services by the urban and rural India is one such challenge This gives us an immense opportunity as the objective of financial inclusion is not just about giving access to thrift and credit its about empowering individuals to realise their true potential and contribute to a thriving economy Financial inclusion needs to be redefined by developing bespoke products and services that are best suited to different strata of the society depending upon their income level This shall include innovative solutions that make it easier for people to not only access basic but also to use a variety of financial services Towards this end and to enable easy adequate and customized credit the Reserve Bank has made provisions for differentiated banking license These are niche banks which can help plug the gap in meeting specialised needs for banking products and services across a wider and diverse spectrum Another critical issue in Indias credit market has been the consistent gap between the demand and supply of credit to Micro Small and Medium Enterprises MSMEs The Micro Small and Medium Enterprises MSME sector contributes around 30 to Indias GDP 45 to its manufacturing output and 48 to exports This has to be seen as an area of opportunity by the banks and other financial institutions Another emerging area of focus is making finance available for transitioning to a low carbon economy All of us are now cognisant of the global challenge that climate change poses to our planet and its impact which is reverberating across the world If we fail to take timely action the consequences will be irreversible The Indian Government has already committed to reduce the total projected carbon emissions from now till 2030 by one billion tonnes reduce carbon intensity of the economy by more than 45 per cent by 2030 and achieve Net Zero emissions by the year 2070 As a central bank we also have a responsibility to promote sustainable economic growth which includes transition to a lowcarbon economy Banks can play an essential role in financing the transition to a lowcarbon economy by channelising finance to sustainable and green projects as well as by developing new financial products that incentivise green initiatives Our actions will set the course not only for the future of the planet but also determine the kind of environment which we bequeath our future generations For a regulator in a developing country given the high rate of technology adoption keeping pace with market innovations is always a challenge Regulating such a dynamic financial sector can be very aptly described as Just when we thought we knew all the answers someone changed the questions But it is our firm belief that for the customers to enjoy the fruits of financial innovation it has to be sustainable and within the realm of a sound regulatory framework Keeping this in mind we have followed a nuanced and consultative approach with an aim to responsible innovation while nudging the industry to adopt sustainable business practices Concluding thoughts It is important for us to be cognizant of the fact that the bedrock of a strong and resilient financial system is the trust that the people repose in it The trust element is not only created just by the individual institutions but by the collective actions of the entities operating in the financial system We expect firms to be responsible for their actions and of the actions of the service providers engaged by them and demonstrate accountability for same Compliance with applicable regulations and ensuring customercentricity are two nonnegotiable principles for entities functioning in the financial sector and the same must flow from the top To conclude I would like to emphasize that the banking sector has been instrumental in Indias growth story and it is crucial that banks continue to innovate and adapt to changing times to meet the evolving needs of the economy As India continues to march forward the banking sector must as hitherto continue to be a key contributor to the countrys growth story As always we at RBI will be working closely to ensure that the banking sector and other stakeholders can help build a stronger more inclusive and sustainable future for India Thank you 1 Keynote

monetary policy transmission as well as in allocation and absorption of risks entailed in financing Indias growth 1 A very good morning to all of you It is indeed a pleasure to be here amidst all of you today at the 17th annual conference of FEDAI These annual events of FEDAI provide an excellent opportunity for the exchange of ideas and thoughts among the foreign exchange market participants and I am sure this one will be no exception 2 Today as I speak to the market veterans assembled here in Cairo it strikes me that it is fitting perhaps that this conference is being held here in the year of Indias G20 presidency the year of the Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam or One Earth One Family One Future India and Egypt are arguably two of the worlds oldest civilizations Both share a glorious past 3 India was one of the largest economies in the world for about two millennia starting around the end of the 1st millennium BC Documented economic history suggests that for most of the period since the first century AD the Indian economy was the largest in the world At the beginning of the British rule in India it accounted for close to a quarter share of global GDP Since then there has been an inexorable loss in Indias share of global GDP But we have not just arrested this decline but indeed have been able to reverse it Indias GDP2 is today the thirdlargest in the world in PPP terms and fifth largest in terms of market exchange rates India is today considered as one of the fastest growing economies of the world with clear emphasis on strong macroeconomic fundamentals and is recognised as one of the few bright spots amidst current challenges and uncertainties 4 The signs of these changes have been quite apparent for some time now In just over a decade the countrys nominal GDP has increased fourfold from 64 lakh crore for FY 2010 to 273 lakh crore for FY 20233 Its external trade has also increased from 29 lakh crore to 137 lakh crore during the same period4 As a percentage of GDP external trade has increased sharply in the last two decades from about 26 per cent at the turn of the century to about 45 per cent currently5 Equally noteworthy is the fact that the development has been inclusive with millions of people being lifted out of poverty According to a recent United Nations Development Programme update 415 million people were lifted out of poverty in the decade and half leading up to the COVID19 pandemic while the incidence of poverty has more than halved6 Concomitantly the financial sector has expanded both in terms of depth and diversity with differentiated niche banks catering to the differing needs of the economy and society A diverse set of NBFCs have also been operating reaching the proverbial last mile to the individual customers and in fact traversing beyond that Fintech has emerged as a potential force multiplier while India is today an acknowledged world leader in fast payment systems 5 The transformation in the world of foreign exchange and more generally in financial markets over the years has been no less striking As veterans in this audience would be aware the journey of exchange control in India began with the framing of the Defence of India Rules1939 by the British Government as a temporary war time measure These rules assumed statutory basis through the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act FERA 1947 In view of an acute shortage of foreign exchange reserves FERA 1947 was replaced by FERA 1973 which sought to put in place stringent controls for the conservation of the foreign exchange resources of the country and the proper utilization thereof7 While this approach continued in the 1970s and 1980s there was a paradigm shift in the approach to external sector management in the early 1990s when the Rupee was made fully convertible on the current account and the lietmotif changed from conservation of foreign exchange to the management of foreign exchange through facilitation of external trade and payments as well as orderly development of foreign exchange markets This change was formalized through the Foreign Exchange Management Act FEMA enacted in 1999 The subsequent two decades have seen a calibrated opening up of the capital account with significant liberalization in the regulatory framework related to foreign direct investment FDI external commercial borrowing foreign investment in domestic debt markets and overseas investments 6 In the broader financial markets too policy measures during the 1990s set the stage for the transition to marketdetermined interest and exchange rates and saw significant development in different market segments Initial policy efforts were focussed on delivering a measured development of different market segments and supporting market infrastructure with a view to reaping the benefits of deeper and more liquid markets As markets developed and lent confidence the pace of reforms and liberalisation picked up and continued despite the myriad episodes of turmoil over the last decade and a half With the policy priority of ensuring that financial markets are sufficiently developed to meet the requirements of a growing economy and of users both resident and nonresident the reforms were reconfigured to deepen onshore financial markets remove segmentation across market segments and increase the efficiency of price discovery within a robust infrastructure and conduct framework 7 Several analysts and economist have predicted that this decade will be Indias decade and they have predicted that Indias GDP will triple and per capital income will almost double by 2031 powered by manufacturing and export opportunities India is all set to benefit from major global trends such as offshoring of manufacturing to friendlier countries popularly called friend shoring because of its geopolitical alignments technologybased services because of its adoption of increasing digitalisation and a young population which is eager to excel The Honourable Prime Minister has set before all of us a goal of making India a developed nation by 2047 as one of the Panch Pran for the centenary of the countrys independence Against the aspirations ambitions and opportunities the theme of this years FEDAIs conference India Back to the Future Better Bolder and Benevolent is very apt 8 When fundamental transformations such as the one we are witnessing takes place there are many moving parts which need to come together and move in sync There are many actors who have critical roles to ensure that each of these parts move at the desired pace and efficiency As stakeholders in financial markets we all know that it has a critical role to play in funding our growth aspirations and in supporting an increasingly complex and interconnected financial system The key actors in financial market development include selfregulatory organisations such as FEDAI Given that this is a FEDAI conference let me focus today on the role of selfregulatory organisations SROs in market development and market conduct and also set out a few thoughts on the role played hitherto by FEDAI in the development of foreign exchange markets as well as expectations from it going forward SelfRegulatory Organisations 9 Let me first start with a look at the evolution of SROs around the world The idea of selfregulation generally involves the members of a group coming together to establish rules of conduct and voluntarily committing to follow those rules Selfregulation has a long history of existence in various professions as a means to encourage and promote appropriate conduct by the members of the profession In the financial sector elements of selfregulation by stock exchanges dates back more than two centuries with the London Stock Exchange adopting such a system in the eighteenthcentury In the United States selfregulation by stock exchanges preceded the creation of the federal regulatory agency ie the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC In Canada the Bond Market Association of the Toronto Board of Trade emerged as an SRO in 1920s In recent times SROs in the financial sector have been delegated authority formally or informally by public authorities to frame guidelines for appropriate conduct by its members and utilize tools such as voluntary agreements standards charters byelaws handbooks of market practices etc to ensure such appropriate conduct Effective SROs complement the regulatory and supervisory efforts of public authorities 10 In any sector financial or otherwise there could be four categories in terms of rules that the players are subject to The first category is the one where there are no rules explicit or implicit This is a rare situation and feasible only in narrow businesses where the sector imposes no or minimal externalities on the broader system In the absence of rules however industries do not always act in broader public interest and their behaviour often tends to favour the powerful at the cost of equity fairness and overall social development As a sector grows some form of rules become necessary and are often agreed upon by the players themselves primarily in a bid to impose selfdiscipline among the members An industry which operates only under selfregulation however may not also always act in public interest These concerns assume greater importance as a sector industry develops and starts to become systemically important Here a role for an external neutral body which performs the role of an umpire becomes necessary Such an umpire in a business sector is typically a public or statutory authority in the form of a regulator or the government which sets the rules for an industry The fourth category is one where selfregulation and stateimposed regulation coexist with the regulator or state institution explicitly or implicitly recognizing the SRO The coexistence of a regulator and a SRO is in fact the most common framework or structure prevalent across the world in financial sector SROs Roles and Responsibilities 11 The roles of SROs vary across jurisdictions markets and sectors that they function in Typically in the financial sector the broad objectives of SROs reflect those of the financial sector regulator viz preservation of market and financial integrity and protection of customers investors Within these broad objectives SROs typically work towards establishing minimum benchmarks as well as ethical and behavioural standards With the guidance received from the regulator they help instill professional market conduct amongst their members in order to ensure customer investor protection SROs often get involved in the documentation of operational guidelines that set out the rules of conduct and prescribe market conventions standard procedures and documentation master agreements etc to be followed by market participants In some jurisdictions they monitor adherence to codes of conduct and regulations issued by the regulator and are also empowered to take appropriate action in case of violations SROs also establish dispute resolution frameworks to facilitate early resolution of disputes In their developmental role SROs serve as the representative of their members in various fora including in interactions with the regulator An integral part of SRO functioning is to impart training to the staff of their member organisations and to conduct awareness programmes Thus SROs in the current schema are expected to complement the regulatory supervisory arrangements in financial sector Functioning of SROs Hits and Misses 12 The primary motivation for existence of SROs as an instrument of regulation in the financial sector is to enhance effectiveness in regulations by drawing upon the depth of technical expertise of practitioners Involvement of market experts could also enhance effectiveness in regulations by highlighting various technical and practical aspects nuances and tradeoffs involved in regulatory policy SROs are also likely to have closer informal and formal contacts in the industry and have their ears to the ground They can therefore facilitate relatively more proactive agile and flexible responses to changing financial conditions As pointed out by William O Douglas a former chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission through developing code of ethics and conduct selfregulation could be persuasive and effectively influence participants conduct in the realms of morality and ethics compared to laws and governmental regulations8 SROs acting as watchdogs against unethical or dubious practices could foster greater confidence in the integrity of the whole ecosystem SROs also facilitate resolution of disputes among members within the industry rather than taking recourse to an external body or the courts SROs can thus complement the regulatory framework and contribute to the effective functioning of the financial system 13 Despite potential benefits concerns related to selfregulation have also attracted widespread attention Concerns arise from the fact that SROs largely comprise of industry members and are hence subject to conflicts of interest arising between latters own commercial interests and formers expected public role Such conflicts can lead to weakening of the regulatory structure and potentially harm the interests of the customers investors SROs could also find it hard to prevent collusive behaviour leading to inefficiencies and dissatisfaction among consumers They may not be appropriately vigilant to issues around misconduct by their members These risks could be further accentuated in cases where the impact of activities is not immediately apparent but could prove to be potentially harmful in the longer run A case in point from an environmentally sensitive sector is one of an industry causing air or water pollution the impact of which is not visible in the short run and may not invite consumer or societal activism The concern is that SROs may not be able to adequately divest themselves from the interests of their members 14 These aspects have come to light in various industries sectors over the course of the years Over past few decades the financial sector both at the global as well as domestic level has witnessed recurrent instances of unethical behaviour The ability of financial sector intermediaries to uphold themselves to high moral standards came under the cloud in the wake of revelations about the irregular practices around LIBOR fixing The reliance on selfregulation of hedge funds and the derivatives markets was criticized as contributing to the Global Financial Crisis In fact many of these events led to a rethink in the approach towards regulatory framework with greater reliance on regulations returning to public authorities 15 For any SRO to remain relevant in this milieu it is critical that it demonstrates unrelenting efforts towards ensuring fair practices by its members and is seen as contributing to the objectives of market integrity and customer protection SROs must display their willingness and ability to address concerns beyond the interest of their membership viz to protect customers participants and other stakeholders in the ecosystem They must remain neutral and be seen to maintain objectivity Putting in place robust governance norms and internal controls remaining abreast with market innovations proactively identifying and acting on breaches and misconduct and continuously striving to keep in sight the big picture of balancing market innovation with market integrity are some of measures through which SROs can ensure their continuing credibility and relevance History has shown us that an SRO is credible and its role significant only when it is backed by a long track record of responsible behavior under the oversight of public authorities 16 With this background let me share some thoughts on the experience in selfregulation in Indian financial markets the evolution of FEDAI and the role played by it in the foreign exchange market in India Selfregulation in Indian Financial Markets 17 In India the history of selfregulation has developed over the years though formal regulatory frameworks for SROs is of a relatively recent origin In the foreign exchange market FEDAI was formed in 1958 to lay down the terms and conditions for operations of Authorized Dealers in India Similar to the developments in other jurisdictions stock exchanges in India also have historically performed functions akin to SROs In 2004 SEBI issued regulations on SROs providing guidelines on eligibility recognition functions and responsibilities of SROs In the payments and settlement space RBI has recently ie in 2020 issued a framework for the recognition of selfregulatory organizations for payment system operators FEDAI Evolution Role and a few Questions 18 Under FERA 1947 only a handful of the foreign banks were designated as Exchange Banks and were permitted to provide foreign exchange related services These banks carried out their business as per the guidelines laid down by the then Exchange Banks Association As more and more banks were allowed to transact in foreign exchange this structure was formalized with the establishment of the FEDAI on August 16 1958 In the initial years of its formation FEDAIs primary function was setting the basic ground rules for the computation of rates and settlements for interbank and customer transactions Its primary objective was to bring about uniformity in the rates offered by different Authorized Dealers in a bid to avoid unhealthy competition and ensure uniform service to clients9 19 As the foreign exchange markets developed the roles and responsibilities of FEDAI also evolved FEDAI has been instrumental in conceptualising detailed rules on the conduct of foreign exchange business among banks and its customers and has hence contributed to customer protection and fair treatment It has effectively acted as a bridge between the market participants and the regulator and has contributed to the development of the foreign exchange regime in the country over the years I do know that FEDAI has also been working towards the training and skill upgradations of professionals working in the foreign exchange arena It has also been facilitating the implementation adoption of the Global FX code which sets out principles that promote a robust fair liquid open and appropriately transparent market underpinned by high ethical standards More recently FEDAI took commendable measures during the Covid19 pandemic to ease the difficulties faced by the Authorised Dealer banks and their customers in carrying out forex business 20 But again this is also a time to introspect and towards that end let me flag a few questions issues to ponder upon While I would urge upon you to introspect on this fundamental issue concerning the neutrality of SROs let me also outline a few other specific areas where we in the Reserve Bank would like to see more efforts by FEDAI 21 One such issue is about fair pricing for the retail smaller customers We have had many occasions of customers of Authorised Dealers especially from the MSME and retail segments approaching us and expressing concerns about the high charges for foreign exchange transactions levied by Authorised Dealer banks While large corporates are able to enjoy the benefits of tighter pricing warranted by the liquidity in our markets charges recovered from smaller customers do not appear to be justified by higher cost of processing warehousing small ticket transactions The FXRetail platform was introduced in a bid to shift price discovery to an automated platform Banks do not however appear to have made efforts to encourage customers to use that platform What is worrisome about the higher charges levied on the smaller customers is the complete lack of transparency regarding the information on charges levied for such customers We would definitely like to see concerted efforts by FEDAI and all banks in ensuring fair and transparent pricing for the less resourceful customers of the forex markets 22 While the regulatory framework for financial markets and the broader foreign exchange system has been simplified and overhauled over the last few years it would be required of you individually or collectively through FEDAI to make sufficient efforts to ensure that the benefits of simplification rationalization and procedural ease reach every customer An open issue is whether the changes in regulatory framework are being reflected in the conduct of interbank and customer transactions There has been a continuous effort by the Reserve Bank to simplify the regulatory framework for foreign exchange system Most recently Regulations Review Authority 20 was constituted in April 2021 to review the regulations and compliance procedures with a view to streamline and rationalise them and making them more effective But this endeavor is incomplete without the FEDAI also undertaking a similar assessment of its guidelines with a view to identifying and removing any frictions or impediments that hinder the fulfilment of regulatory objectives or impede efficient operations of foreign exchange markets It would be pertinent here to refer to recent budget announcement regarding undertaking a comprehensive review of existing regulations by the financial sector regulators with a view to simplify ease and reduce cost of compliance While we would be doing what is expected from us this endeavour should be forthcoming from the SROs as well 23 The last few years has seen a proliferation of foreign exchange trading platforms offering services to individuals in the country These platforms have been luring gullible people to undertake forex trading with promises of disproportionate exorbitant returns There have been reports of frauds committed by such unauthorised portals with reports of many residents losing money through such trading schemes The Reserve Bank has been making concerted efforts to warn and sensitise the general public about the pitfalls of undertaking transactions on such platforms including issuing an alert list of unauthorised entities entities promoting transactions on unauthorised platforms It would be appropriate on the part of FEDAI to take a lead here to safeguard the customers of the industry they are an integral part of and sensitise public regarding entities which bring disrepute to the industry Random Thoughts Imminent Threats Emerging Opportunities 24 Against the backdrop of the issues flagged above and the theme of the conference let me also dwell on a few select themes relating to the recent developments in the foreign exchange markets the approach to foreign exchange management as well a few areas of potential future changes A few random thoughts so to say From a rulebased regulatory regime to a principlebased framework 25 First as you will be aware one of the most significant developments in the regulatory framework for foreign exchange management and foreign exchange markets has been a shift from a rulebased prescriptive framework to a principlebased framework Let me cite just a few examples The regulations for hedging of currency risk have been simplified on a single principle any entity resident or nonresident which has an exposure to currency risk should be able to hedge that risk using any product subject only to an assessment of suitability and appropriateness The foreign investment regulations have been rationalized subsuming two original and 91 amendment notifications while broadly keeping the regulations principlebased The Overseas Investment Framework has also recently been reviewed comprehensively in consultation with the Central Government The new regime has dispensed with most procedural approvals by adopting a principlebased approach and has significantly enhanced the ease of doing business by reducing the compliance burden and the associated transaction costs 26 The case for this shift is evident In a fastchanging world where ways of doing business the technology used for doing business and the ways of financing business are constantly evolving it is difficult for a rulebased regulatory regime to keep pace This raises risks of stymying useful innovations on the one hand and leaving gaps which could add to risks to entities or the system on the other The case for simplifying regulations removing fine prints associated with procedural prescriptions and elements of discretion are also important from the perspective of reducing compliance burden and facilitating flexible and nimble footed responses by Authorised Dealers and stakeholders 27 But for a principlebased regulatory framework to work and work effectively there are certain rules of the game First the shift presupposes that all participants including Authorised Dealers accept and adopt the change in letter and in spirit and ensure that the regulations are implemented in a fair and transparent manner and the benefits of the flexibility provided in the regulatory framework reaches the end users of the financial system Second there has to be trust The regulator needs to be able to trust that regulated entities will not abuse the flexibility provided in the regulations Third the shift to a principlebased framework also entrusts a much higher level of responsibility on the Authorised Dealers In fact the more we move towards a principlebased framework the greater will be the responsibility of the Authorised Dealers For instance under the new Overseas Investment regime all transactions relating to ODI or financial commitment by an eligible resident entity in a foreign entity is required to be routed through the designated AD bank The AD bank is not only responsible for ensuring bona fides of the transactions and compliance with KYC AML guidelines but also compliance with FEMA provisions We had earlier come across instances of AD banks permitting remittance towards overseas investment without receiving the requisite returns from the investor entity Though it was always implicit in terms of section 105 of FEMA that such oversight by AD banks makes them liable for penal action under sections 11 and 13 of FEMA the new directions have stated it unambiguously New actors new products new markets A new playing field 28 The foreign exchange arena in particular the foreign exchange market has in many ways been a sheltered playing field for Authorised Dealers But this is changing and changing fast As an Authorised Dealer till recently you had to deal in a small suite of products Simple Easy to understand Easy to price Now that there is scope for Authorised Dealers to innovate and design new products there are challenges You need to think about whether a product is permissible You need to understand the product You need to be able to price it independently You need to assess the client base to whom the product can be offered And you need to be sure that the product is being offered in a manner which is both suitable and appropriate for the client to which it is being offered 29 The flexibility embedded in regulations is easy appreciate More products add to depth and liquidity in financial markets More importantly they enable more efficient hedging of risks But there are risks on both sides of the spectrum The introduction of new products can get limited by the ability of market participants to offer them Our experience has been that only some of the Authorised Dealers are able to offer even marginally sophisticated structured products to their clients which results both in lower liquidity in products and incomplete markets and in depriving segments of endusers of benefitting from the flexibility provided in the regulations But again there are risks of Authorised Dealers dealing in products which they do not understand or are not able to price independently or of offering them to customers who do not understand the product or where it is not suited for them We are all aware of past such incidences that teach us about the pitfalls to avoid Of course our Directions on Market Makers in OTC derivatives seek to provide a principlebased regulatory framework to address these risks Hence it is imperative that these regulations are adhered to in both letter and spirit 30 There are also new players in the playing field Traditionally the foreign exchange market was characterised by a closed user group with banks being the only authorised dealers and a few domestic corporates being the primary clients Exporters and importers with small hedging needs and individuals with personal forex requirements were marginal players essentially accessing the market as price takers The regulatory framework now permits nonresidents to access the domestic foreign exchange market to hedge their risks and also in case of nondeliverable derivatives to access the market without the need for underlying exposures Domestically as the economy is opening up with increasing capital account convertibility and getting more and more integrated with the global economy there are an increasing number of domestic entities getting exposed to foreign exchange risk and hence may need to access the foreign exchange market Going forward these trends are likely to accentuate With different players there will be diverse needs and Authorised Dealers will need to gear up to serve these needs Illustratively the hedging needs of an exporter or importer are very different from that of a corporate issuing foreign currency denominated bonds in offshore markets or setting up an overseas subsidiary 31 As the economy grows and becomes more developed the scope of participation in foreign exchange markets would change Till recently only contractual exposures could be hedged the exception being hedging of exposures based on past performance Now the scope of participation in the foreign exchange markets has been expanded to include the hedging of anticipated exposures of course subject to safeguards to prevent excessive speculation With the increasing integration of the economy with the rest of the world more and more entities are likely to directly or indirectly get exposed to foreign exchange risks There are likely to be demands for permitting hedging of economic exposures While this may be tricky given the current extent of capital account convertibility the possibility of such hedging being permitted over a period of time as we progress further down the path of capital account convertibility needs to be carefully evaluated 32 A whole new market with a new set of market participants has been opened up with banks in India allowed to participate in the offshore nondeliverable market for Rupee derivatives in a bid to integrate markets This is a part of the overall effort towards greater convertibility Results of these measures are already visible For example onshoreoffshore spreads have substantially narrowed after allowing Indian banks to access the NDF market The move has opened up a whole new opportunity for all of you assembled here today an opportunity to make our markets larger make them more efficient and to access an entire set of new participants These opportunities have to be leveraged It also needs to be ensured that the domestic market scales up its efficiency and ensures that this opening does not result in flows moving to the offshore market 33 Further dynamics are likely to emerge as we progress down the path of internationalisation of the Rupee It is now widely accepted that while internationalisation and a freer capital account comes with its own set of benefits it is not without risks and that freer capital flows comes with their own set of challenges the primary one being that of volatility and we need to gear up to manage that We are seeing a good amount of interest in the Rupee trading arrangements that we have been endeavouring to put in place If our efforts towards Rupee invoicing bear fruit domestic exporters and importers will not need to hedge but there will be other opportunities in the form of their nonresident counterparts who may need to hedge New technologies new frontiers 34 Let me now talk a bit about how innovations in technology are influencing liquidity provisioning and price discovery in the FX markets and its implications You all are aware that traditionally counterparties in the FX market transacted with each other over phone calls voice or through forex brokers In the last couple of decades however several electronic trading venues have emerged both as exchange venues as well as electronic trading platforms Increasingly OTC FX trades globally as well as in India are being executed on these venues leading to increasing electronification of FX market trading During the last decade we are seeing some new forms of trading venues such as singlebank platforms SBPs These venues are fundamentally different from traditional multibank platforms MBPs where the operator is typically a nonbank technology provider Globally SBPs are often referred to as dark pools since price and trade information are not disseminated on such platforms unlike in the case of an MBP The development is also leading to a dispersion of global FX liquidity across a wide range of trading platforms In recent years SBPs are also becoming visible in the Indian FX market with trading volumes rising on such venues While it is heartening to note an increasing share of FX being transacted electronically the same must not come at the cost of increased opaqueness in pricing You must all make efforts to be transparent while pricing of instruments Concluding Thoughts 35 In a constantly evolving world where change is the only constant the journey of the Indian foreign exchange market over the last few decades has been one of continuous development and innovation The Reserve Bank remains committed to continuously move ahead at a steady pace in line with the changing macrofinancial environment globally and domestically Going ahead greater challenges will emerge as the markets become more developed and interconnected and as the range of products expand New frontiers will also emerge as Indian banks expand their presence in offshore markets nonresident participation in domestic markets grows and as technological changes continue to transform the manner in which markets function Foreign exchange market participants will have to prepare themselves to manage the changes and the associated risks and FEDAI will have to play a leading and constructive

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1349&fn=6,Date Financial markets in India In pursuit of stability and development,Wellfunctioning liquid and resilient financial markets help monetary policy transmission as well as in allocation and absorption of risks entailed in financing Indias growth It is my pleasure to be part of the Annual FIMMDA1PDAI2 Conference today I would like to place on record the Reserve Banks appreciation of the critical role played by FIMMDA and PDAI in the development of financial markets in India over the years and more recently in partnering with the RBI in guiding the markets and the economy through the turbulent times of COVID19 the war in Ukraine and the turmoil in financial markets 2 Today as I speak before keen market players veterans and experts I thought this would be an opportune moment to recapture the journey of our financial markets in the last decade or so and reflect on where we are and what we think about the course ahead An attempt to draw from the past and forge ahead so to speak 3 From the global financial crisis to the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis from the taper tantrum to Brexit from unprecedented quantitative easing to among the most accelerated monetary tightening in recent memory from a pandemic which brought humankind to a standstill to a geopolitical crisis which threatens the world order as it exists today it would not be an exaggeration to say that the world has moved from one storm to another in the years since the global financial crisis 4 Against this backdrop the journey of Indian financial markets has been driven by two key objectives stability and development Crisis management has been a key component of this journey Nonetheless the pursuit of developmental reforms with the key objective of widening and deepening of financial markets was continued even amidst the worst storms The Journey so far 5 Let me take a moment to reflect on the journey of Indian financial markets over the past few decades Right up to the end of the 1980s the Indian economy was characterised by an administered interest rate regime fixed exchange rates a captive government securities market and current and capital account restrictions Policy measures during the decade of the 1990s set the stage for a transition to marketdetermined interest and exchange rates shift to a multiple indicator approach and eventually to flexible inflation targeting in the conduct of monetary policy convertibility in the current account and gradual liberalisation of the capital account The policy measures were bolstered by several key legislative changes the Foreign Exchange Management Act FEMA 1999 the Government Securities Act 2006 the amendments to the RBI Act in 2006 to give explicit regulatory powers to the Reserve Bank over government securities derivatives and money market instruments and the Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007 The Clearing Corporation of India Ltd was set up in 2001 to provide clearing and guaranteed settlement for money government securities forex and derivative markets A Real Time Gross Settlement System RTGS and the NDSOM platform were operationalised A Trade Repository was put in place for derivatives Some of these initiatives became important at a global level only after the G20 rolled out its reforms agenda in the 2009 Pittsburgh Summit 6 After the global financial crisis 2008 the Indian financial markets were nascent but growing The approach to foreign participation in most market segments was cautious Derivative markets the markets for the purpose of hedging risks were limited in terms of participants and products Meanwhile the BIS Triennial survey published in 2013 showed that there was growing interest in the Indian Rupee overseas The onshore and offshore markets for the Rupee however remained segmented with the spreads between the onshore and offshore forex and interest rates being wide Headwinds and Tailwinds 7 Coming to more recent times many of our policies over the last decade have been guided by the learnings from crisis management as well as the developmental objectives our country aspires to achieve As the world moved through one storm after another we were compelled to navigate through the spillovers of major global headwinds 8 Equally compelling in guiding policy were the needs of the economy As the real sector grew over the last decade expectations from the financial markets also grew The needs of the economy reflect these developments To place this in perspective lets look at some figures Nominal GDP increased fourfold from 64 lakh crore for FY 2010 to 273 lakh crore for FY 20233 External trade also increased over fourfold from 29 lakh crore to 137 lakh crore during the same period4 The ratio of trade to GDP5 has risen to 45 in 2021 from 25 in 2000 Foreign Direct Investment FDI6 in the country has risen sharply by two and a half times since 2010 The flow of resources to the commercial sector in India almost doubled from 12 lakh crore in FY 2012 to 22 lakh crore in FY 20227 While banks continue to be a dominant source of financing market borrowings8 of the commercial sector increased from 74000 crore in FY 2012 to 316000 crore in FY 2022 As our economy and financial markets grew the integration with the world economy and global financial markets has also risen The growing economy and our aspirations to be and remain among the fastest growing economies has expanded our funding needs All these necessitate larger and deeper financial markets The policy response to headwinds 9 It is relevant to look at some of our policy responses in recent times especially to major global headwinds Each successive episode of turmoil over the last decade and half has posed a specific set of challenges for the economy Each has warranted a specific response 10 In 2008 policy actions were aimed at ensuring comfortable system liquidity augmenting forex reserves and maintaining a crisis management framework to support the economy through the global financial crisis Conventional tools such as policy interest rates and cash reserve ratio CRR were used Measures to manage forex liquidity included inter alia relaxing the interest rate ceiling on foreign currency deposits by nonresident Indians and external commercial borrowings ECB for corporates Unconventional measures included a rupeedollar swap facility for Indian banks a refinance window for mutual funds and a special purpose vehicle for supporting nonbanking financial companies 11 Post the announcement of early taper of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve in 2013 the need for restoring confidence of market participants and containing the pressure on the Rupee guided the Reserve Banks policy responses Monetary conditions were tightened through unconventional tools Forex market measures included both direct intervention and administrative measures to manage capital flows These included import restrictions of nonessential items opening of a special dollar swap window for PSU oil companies a concessional swap window for Foreign Currency NonResident FCNRB deposits increased overseas borrowing limits of banks enhanced foreign investment limits in government debt and restrictions on outward investment flows Liberalised Remittance Scheme LRS entitlements as well as exchangetraded derivatives 12 The outbreak of the COVID19 pandemic in March 2020 necessitated swift and focussed policy responses to address the emerging or potential market dislocations As in the past policy rates were reduced and systemic liquidity was expanded But this time the policy corridor was asymmetrically widened and the fixed rate reverse repo became the effective anchor for the evolution of short and longerterm interest rates To improve transmission of policy rates and ensure flow of credit to the affected sectors unconventional measures were used viz the LongTerm Repo Operations LTROs targeted LTROs and special refinance facilities to All India Financial Institutions A special liquidity facility for mutual funds aimed at assuaging redemption pressures was also instituted For the first time the Reserve Bank pledged its balance sheet to revive the economy through a Government Securities Acquisition Programme GSAP which provided an upfront commitment on the amounts to be purchased Special open market operations involving simultaneous purchase and sale of securities Operation Twist were undertaken for orderly evolution of the yield curve and liquidity management Forward guidance gained prominence with the emergence of time and statecontingent guidance with assurances on the Reserve Banks commitment to maintain congenial financial conditions Communication became a significant part of our monetary policy toolkit 13 The onset of the war in Ukraine again weakened risk sentiment with commodity prices and inflation rising to multidecade highs As major central banks accelerated policy rate hikes and tightened liquidity to tackle inflationary pressures financial market volatility spiralled and the Rupee came under considerable pressure The policy response this time eschewed administrative measures to contain outflows and instead focused on measures to enhance inflows through incentivising nonresident deposits foreign investments in debt instruments and ECBs To promote exports and support the increasing global interest in the Rupee an additional arrangement for invoicing payment and settlement of exports imports in Rupees was put in place 14 The point I want to emphasise here is that while there were clear common strands in the Reserve Banks response to various episodes of turmoil the response was customised to each episode in terms of policy objectives and choices and use of toolkits Every response was a function of the underlying macroeconomic conditions and reflected learnings from earlier crises In this context I would like to mention three distinctive features of our policy responses First all liquidity management operations by the Reserve Bank including measures for mutual funds and NBFCs have always been through banks which are the liquidity conduits for the Reserve Bank even in peace times Second the measures entailed no dilution of collateral standards and ensured that the central bank remained cushioned from counterparty risks Third most of the measures this time around were timebound and expired as per their originally defined maturity Illustratively the GSAP was discontinued relaxations with respect to CRR were allowed to normalise and the liquidity management framework was tweaked in April 2022 to operationalise the standing deposit facility SDF This approach has enabled us to get out of a potential liquidity trap the Chakravyuh 15 Interestingly and perhaps paradoxically the measures to reform and develop financial markets have taken place at an unprecedented pace during a decade of unprecedented challenges The reforms were aimed at deepening onshore financial markets and increasing the efficiency of price discovery The more recent reforms sought to i remove market segmentation by simultaneously easing access of nonresidents to domestic markets and permitting residents to access offshore markets ii expand the participation base by encouraging nonresident participation in financial markets and retail participation through the provision of easy access for example through the Retail Direct and FX Retail platforms iii facilitate more sophisticated users to access markets for their hedging needs and to express their views on market movements iv promote innovation through the introduction of a larger suite of products which can be customised to the needs of individual market participants9 and v ensure fair user conduct through protection of the retail user and a sound receptive and a customer suitability framework A robust infrastructure and conduct framework has been put in place through efficient clearing and settlement arrangements benchmark reforms transparency requirements and stipulations on market abuse among others 16 India has also come a long way towards achieving higher levels of capital account convertibility Liberalisation of Foreign Direct Investment FDI flows continued over the last decade with FDI becoming unrestricted except in certain sensitive strategic sectors Limits for nonresident investments in domestic market markets were liberalised The Voluntary Retention Route VRR was introduced to facilitate nonresident investment in government and corporate bonds A Fully Accessible Route FAR which places no limit on nonresident investment in specified benchmark government securities was introduced as part of further liberalisation of portfolio debt inflows The ECB framework was comprehensively liberalised and is now subject only to an overall soft limit and a few end use restrictions Regulations for Overseas Direct Investments ODI have also been rationalised and liberalised The LRS is now available for both current and capital account transactions Where do we stand today 17 In the aftermath of multiple shocks the global economy is projected to contract significantly in 2023 The worst for the global economy both in terms of growth and inflation seems to be behind us Lately with some ebbing of COVIDrelated restrictions and cooling of inflation in various countries though still elevated central banks have started what appears to be a pivot towards lower rate hikes or pauses At the same time they continue to emphatically reiterate their resolve to bring inflation down closer to targets High policy rates for a longer duration appear to be a distinct possibility going forward On the growth front projections are now veering around to a softer recession as against a severe and more widespread recession projected a few months back 18 In this hostile and uncertain international environment the Indian economy remains resilient drawing strength from its macroeconomic fundamentals Our financial system remains robust and stable Banks and corporates are healthier than before the crisis Bank credit is growing in double digits India is widely seen as a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy world Our inflation remains elevated but there has been a welcome softening during November and December 2022 Core inflation however remains sticky and elevated 19 On the external front deglobalisation and protectionism are gaining ground as witnessed during the recent global supplychain shock It is thus necessary to build and strengthen bilateral trade relations to deal with such challenges India has recently signed bilateral trade agreements with the UAE and Australia and more such agreements are works in progress The average current account deficit to GDP ratio stands at 33 per cent during H1202223 The slowing global demand is weighing on merchandise exports but our exports of services and remittances remain strong The net balance under services and remittances remains in a large surplus partly offsetting the trade deficit Consequently the current account deficit is eminently manageable and within the parameters of viability 20 On the financing side net FDI flows remain strong and foreign portfolio flows have resumed since July 2022 with intermittent outflows from time to time The size of forex reserves is comfortable and has gone up from USD 524 billion on October 21 2022 to USD 572 billion as on January 13 2023 Further Indias external debt ratios are low by international standards This has enabled the Reserve Bank to eschew measures to control capital flows and take steps to further internationalise the domestic currency even during episodes of significant capital outflows 21 Every global riskoff episode resulted in an appreciating US dollar imposing downward pressures on most other currencies Comparison of the performance10 of the Rupee across successive crisis episodes tells its own tale During the global financial crisis the Rupee witnessed its worst depreciation between April 1 2008 and March 3 2009 when it lost 23 against the US dollar Similarly it depreciated by 22 during the taper tantrum between May 01 2013 and Aug 28 2013 However the extent of Rupee depreciation was lower in each subsequent episode of turbulence In the initial days of the pandemic ie between February 17 2020 and April 21 2020 the Rupee depreciated by only 7 Even during the period of geopolitical tensions emerging out of Ukraine in 2022 while the Rupee lost 9 against the US dollar between February 24 2022 and October 19 2022 it outperformed the currencies of most advanced and many emerging market economies 22 Importantly the Rupees performance in terms of volatility remained impressive For example the 1month implied volatility of the Rupee touched a high of 25 during the global financial crisis on October 10 2008 and 20 during the taper tantrum period on August 29 2013 During the COVID19 pandemic however the implied volatility peaked at 10 on March 24 2020 and has remained well anchored11 thereafter despite the uncertainties associated with the war and monetary tightening by major central banks The Government bond market has also remained resilient with average bidask spreads being the lowest among peer nations The yield curve has also evolved in an orderly manner without any undue volatility despite the significantly higher government borrowing Looking ahead 23 Today when we look ahead we still see challenges but we can prepare for them with optimism and confidence The Indian financial markets have developed appreciably over the years Liquidity in the government securities and the overnight money markets have grown Bidask spreads remain narrow reflecting efficiency in price discovery In the forex market overall trading volumes have grown and a suite of hedging products have emerged Volumes in the interest rate swap market have grown consistently and new products in these markets are also developing Onshore and offshore markets are getting increasingly integrated with narrowing of forex and interest rates across the markets Nonresident participation in markets is growing albeit gradually 24 The global economy is still marred by shocks and uncertainty Financial markets remain volatile and the geopolitical situation continues to be tense International food energy and commodity prices have eased but uncertainties do remain Inflation remains high and broadbased across countries The IMF has projected contractions in over onethird of the global economy 25 In India we have come a long way in the development of financial markets but this remains work in progress The Reserve Bank and stakeholders like FIMMDA and PDAI need to work together and focus on certain specific areas Secondary market liquidity in gsecs is concentrated in a few securities and tenors The MIBORbased OIS remains the only major liquid product in the interest rate derivative market A term money market remains absent notwithstanding a host of facilitative policy measures Access of the retail segment to markets especially derivative markets needs to improve further In the forex markets while corporates benefit from the tight bidask spreads smaller users continue to face pricing disadvantages notwithstanding regulatory requirements for fair and transparent pricing Likewise there remains a need for improvement in ensuring liquidity for retail investors in the government securities markets Conclusion 26 The journey of Indian financial markets through the last decade has been a story of steady progress with stability We have been steadfast in our commitment and consistent in our approach to keep the ship stable while continuing to move ahead Going forward greater challenges will emerge as the footprints of Indian banks increase in the offshore markets the range of products expand nonresident participation in domestic markets grows and as capital account convertibility increases Market participants will have to prepare themselves to manage the changes and the risks associated with globally integrated markets The achievement of desired outcomes is contingent on financial institutions and market participants taking forward the reform agenda so that we have more vibrant and resilient financial markets Thank you

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1341&fn=6,Date Financial Benchmarks in India A Coming of Age,Wellfunctioning liquid and resilient financial markets help monetary policy transmission as well as in allocation and absorption of risks entailed in financing Indias growth Smt Usha Thorat Chairperson FBIL Shri RN Kar CEO FBIL distinguished speakers colleagues and friends It is a pleasure to be speaking today at the annual dinner of the Financial Benchmarks India Limited Over the last decade following the LIBOR problems international attention to reform financial benchmarks has been a major component of the postGFC regulatory overhaul of financial systems Today as we stand in the final stages of transition away from LIBOR towards alternative benchmarks is an opportune moment to look back at the reforms undertaken in financial benchmark administration in India and assess the progress Introduction 1 Financial benchmarks used as reference for pricing valuation and settlement of financial instruments are a key driver of price integrity of financial markets From deciding the interest rate on a retail loan to determining the payoff in a complex derivative financial benchmarks are ubiquitous and deeply embedded in financial systems By promoting standardisation they facilitate liquidity in markets thereby lowering transactions costs Robust benchmarks promote financial stability by improving transparency in pricing and reducing information asymmetry Use of benchmarks in valuation helps ascertain the fair value of a financial instrument and incentivizes trading in the instrument Financial benchmarks also facilitate monetary policy transmission and help assess the efficacy of such transmission 2 Welldesigned robust benchmarks that are reliable and resistant to manipulation are critical for the stability of the financial system In a sense financial benchmarks can be seen as a public good The BIS in a 2013 report titled Towards better reference rate practices a central bank perspective2 highlighted reliability robustness frequency ready availability and representativeness as the desirable features of a benchmark Reliability is based on governance standards and administration to protect from manipulation and errors robustness relates to maintaining integrity even during episodes of market stress proper frequency provides stability as well as relevance representativeness implies that the benchmark is rooted in appropriate prices and ready availability facilitates ease of pricing and contract verification 3 All these above features contribute to standardisation and comparability across markets with diverse instruments participants location and venues Critical to the emergence of financial benchmarks and their use is credibility and trust that the benchmarks accurately reflect the price of the referenced financial instrument The core issue at the loss of trust in the LIBOR lay in its measurement methodology the fact that it relied on estimates as well as the inadequacy of its governance framework This triggered a series of reforms aimed primarily at changing reliance to actual traded prices and improving the integrity of benchmark administration The resultant International Organization of Securities Commissions IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks is today the overarching framework for ensuring best practices for benchmark administrators and submitters Financial Benchmarks The Indian experience so far 4 In the backdrop of the global developments the Reserve Bank constituted a committee in 2013 chaired by Shri P Vijaya Bhaskar then Executive Director to recommend sturdy practices for financial benchmarks The Committee made several important recommendations including creating an independent structure separate from FIMMDA and FEDAI the then benchmark administrators for the Indian Rupee interest rates and Forex benchmarks respectively for administration of the benchmarks This as we all know led to the formation of FBIL 5 The Committee also recommended that benchmark administrators be subject to regulatory oversight In 2019 the Reserve Bank issued the Directions on Financial Benchmark Administrators putting in place a regulatory framework for benchmark administrators in the markets regulated by it These Directions apply to significant benchmarks taking into consideration their use efficiency and relevance in domestic financial markets while providing flexibility to the administrators with regard to other benchmarks and to facilitate development of newer benchmarks The Directions set out the requirements for inter alia overall responsibilities of benchmark administrators as well as the framework for governance controls and accountability in the benchmark administration process 6 RBI has notified the list of significant benchmarks in these markets and put in place an oversight framework for the administrators of significant benchmarks Several enhancements have been carried out to the benchmark computation and administration process by FBIL since its inception 7 FBIL played a pivotal role in modifying existing benchmarks to conform to global standards For example the Mumbai Interbank Outright Rate MIBOR first introduced by the National Stock Exchange NSE in 1998 and computed through a polling process is now based on actual transactions The Mumbai Interbank Forward Outright Rate MIFOR has been transformed into the Modified MIFOR using the alternate reference rate secured overnight financing rate SOFR instead of LIBOR in line with the global transition away from the LIBOR Modified MIFOR is now being used for all new contracts New benchmarks have also been introduced in various market segments viz Market Repo Overnight Rate MROR Tbill rate and certificate of deposit CD rate 8 Indian financial markets have witnessed substantial growth in the last few years facilitated in part by the availability of robust benchmarks The MIBOR benchmark is the underlying reference rate for MIBOR overnight indexed swap OIS contracts The open interest has increased from 19 lakh crore in FY 2017 to 77 lakh crore in current FY 2023 There is also a growing offshore market for MIBOR based OIS NDOIS In the currency market the USDINR Reference Rate is used by many domestic users including corporates The reference rate is used for settlement of nondeliverable forwards NDFs and exchangetraded futures as well The average daily turnover in INR NDFs has increased from around US164 billion in 2016 to US 464 billion in 2022 During the same period the average daily turnover in exchange traded currency futures in India increased from US 28 billion to US 66 billion As markets have grown the pool of assets using FBIL benchmark rates for valuation has also grown 9 An ideal benchmark is one which is anchored in observable transactions in a liquid market with a diverse set of participants and which remains robust in the face or market disruption and minimises scope for market manipulation But the realities of many markets globally and in India are far from this utopian world The reforms associated with benchmarks over the last several years have therefore focussed on effectively addressing the shortcomings in benchmark design and the absence of robust governance processes that contributed to past abuses and in instilling confidence in financial benchmarks through reforms in benchmark governance design quality and accountability mechanisms Challenges with benchmark administration 10 All benchmarks are susceptible to weaknesses arising from the nonzero probability of errors of omission and commission the liquidity and diversification of underlying markets technology induced changes in market microstructure etc There is a need for constant vigilance on all these fronts even in the most liquid of markets The need for vigilance is stronger still in case of benchmarks in less liquid illiquid markets where benchmarks are based on polling and or modelbased rates In the rest of my speech I will dwell upon some specific features of financial markets in India which can pose challenges for effective benchmark development and administration and which we will all need to be cognisant and watchful about Money markets 11 Consider the overnight money market in India In the call money market used for the calculation of MIBOR benchmark nonbanks were phased out beginning from 2001 Prudential limits on borrowing and lending in the call money market by banks and primary dealers were also put in place in 2002 Synchronous with this the repo markets were developed and repo in government securities gsecs witnessed robust growth in line with global trends towards collateralised overnight markets Amidst these developments call money transaction volumes declined both relative to repo markets as well as in absolute terms The share of call transactions in overnight money markets has gradually come down from more than 20 in 201112 to below 2 in 202223 Chart 1 Meanwhile daily turnover in the call money market declined from just over 19000 crore at one stage and is currently at around 12000 crore Chart 2 The participant base in the market has also been shrinking3 12 Now consider the use of the MIBOR The benchmark is used in the OIS market The MIBOROIS is the only liquid interest rate derivative market in our country apart from MIFOR with as I mentioned earlier an open interest of 77 lakh crore in the current financial year The MIBOR is also the benchmark for INR OIS trades in the global markets NDOIS I dont think I need to emphasize to this audience the importance of this benchmark and the need for constant vigilance in maintaining its robustness and reliability given dwindling transactions and shrinking participant base in the call money market 13 While volumes in the call money market have been declining the MIBOR benchmark continues to be determined based on actual transactions Further its integrity is ensured given the fact that the call money rate is the target rate for monetary policy transmission and participants in the market have access to the liquidity facilities of RBI Among the other overnight benchmarks the Market Repo Overnight Rate MROR is based on market repo transactions Prima facie this benchmark being based on transactions in a more liquid market and one with a wider participant base can normally be considered to be more robust However the benchmark is not based on pure interbank market that can take the place of MIBOR Repo markets while significantly larger incorporate entities that do not have access to central bank liquidity and therefore their pricing is less robust than call rates for developing benchmark that tracks possible policy rate actions 14 In the term money market FBIL is publishing term MIBOR benchmarks In the absence of a liquid term money market these benchmarks are based on polled submissions The development of the term money market remains elusive notwithstanding several reforms both from a regulatory and a liquidity management perspective Most of the constraints have been addressed removed in phases The eligible participant base in term money markets has been expanded However liquidity in the term money market remains negligible and the development of a robust term money benchmark curve remains a work in progress Of course these are issues not unique to India and are observed in peer nations as well As LIBOR is getting phased out these problems are faced even by developed markets 15 The other segments of the money market the markets for treasury bills and CDs have witnessed impressive growth But the growth has been driven by the size of primary issuances while the secondary markets continue to be characterised by low turnover Here too benchmark computation methodologies rely on statistical techniques Instances of divergence between market prices and benchmark levels are therefore not uncommon The endquarter phenomenon that besets yields of Tbills and CDs while not an infirmity of the benchmark per se undermines their efficiency 16 The commercial paper CP market has also grown on the back of primary issuances but again with low secondary market liquidity Issuances of similarly rated credit that take place at very different rates display different market perceptions across types of issuers eg corporates and NBFCs but even among the same type of issuers Chart 3 This is perhaps one of the reasons why there are difficulties in developing and publishing a CP curve Debt markets 17 Moving on to debt markets the liquidity situation improves in particular in the government securities market Here too as liquidity is concentrated in a few benchmark tenors use of models to arrive at the benchmarks across all tenors becomes necessary Given the importance of government securities yields as the benchmark for pricing of most financial assets there is a need for a suitable methodology to ensure that the benchmark yield curve remains robust and reliable Idiosyncratic factors pose challenges in the computation of benchmarks for State Government Securities SGSs Similarly thin secondary market activity and lack of access to market for borrowers with lower credit rating make benchmarking rather unwieldy in the corporate bond market All these factors reinforce the need for continuing efforts to evolve benchmarks that remain relevant and representative of the market conditions and risk perceptions of the underlying instruments Derivatives markets 18 A thriving derivatives market not only requires robust benchmarks it can also facilitate further development of the underlying markets Limited liquidity in derivative markets can therefore create distortions in benchmark values For example OIS rates which generally remain below gsec yields have occasionally exceeded gsec yields impacted in all probability by nonresidents trading interest Chart 4 Similarly there have been episodes of negative spreads between near and far month forward premia Charts 5 and 6 Such episodes can engender large basis risk and adversely impact the representativeness of benchmark rates 19 MIBOR OIS is the only pure interest rate derivative product in the domestic markets that is characterized by good liquidity While this product has well served the purpose of allowing market participants to express their view on the future movements in interest rates its utility as a tool to enable users to hedge their interest rate risks remains limited Globally term money market rates are generally used as the benchmark for interest rate swaps In the domestic market too there is a need for the development of term benchmarks which can be referenced by interest rate derivative products This issue is becoming increasingly relevant with the recent push towards linking loan pricing to external benchmarks Key Issues to Address 20 Beyond trading interest there is a need to develop robust benchmarks and products which meet the need of hedging asset side requirements of institutional investors such as banks but also liability side requirements of borrowers exposed to benchmark based interest rates on borrowings and loan pricing While the lack of adequate liquidity in some instruments is the primary challenge the reasons for the limited liquidity vary Growing offshore interest in INR products has resulted in globalization of domestic benchmarks Discussed below are some of the issues that need attention to further the process of developing a robust benchmark framework in India Diversified participation A benchmark is as good as the price discovered in the referenced market Efficient price discovery requires on the one hand the participation of investors with varying requirements and diversified trading strategies and on the other continuous pricemaking by marketmakers The postGFC regulation has reduced the role banks traditionally played in marketmaking even in developed markets The degree of illiquidity seen in many traditionally liquid markets is partly explained by this development In the case of India the preponderance of buyandhold category of investors in the gsec and corporate bond market banks insurance companies pension funds provident funds aligns trading activity in one direction leading to volatile overshoots Such infirmities need to be addressed to achieve price efficiency and consequently robust benchmark One way of diversifying participant base is to open the markets to the larger global investor base Taxation accounting and regulatory factors One reason for the limited response to retail participation in gsec market is that it is taxinefficient compared to investing in mutual funds as the latter provides benefits of indexation Similarly asymmetric accounting norms distort incentives for trading and may also induce inefficiencies to hedging activities Certain regulations have the collateral effect of adversely affecting market liquidity There should be coordinated efforts to address the unintended consequences of such taxation accounting or regulatory requirements without undermining the basic objective of such policies Segmentation of markets Market segmentation fragments liquidity and leads to price differentials which erodes the efficacy of benchmarks Seen in the context of the need for investor diversity the fragmentation of Rupee markets between onshore and offshore warrants prioritized attention Internationalization of Rupee interest rate and currency markets holds the promise of wider investor base and global liquidity To this end measures enabling nonresidents to undertake transactions with authorised dealer banks in India providing Indian banks with access to offshore markets to undertake nondeliverable transactions etc have been taken For the benefits to accrue to pricing and therefore benchmarks it is necessary that price impulses move freely from onshore to offshore and vice versa Among other things this may require linked and interoperable infrastructure common marketmakers across the segments and eventually a frictionless channel for investors to move from one market to the other There is a strong case to work towards a longterm solution to this segmentation Extra territoriality A probably unintended consequence of the postGFC drive towards derisking OTC derivatives markets has been the tendency of developed economies to contain the risk of their entities by attempting to maintain control of regulation and risk management practices of third countries Thus for example European banks may not be able to operate through Indian financial infrastructure entities like CCPs benchmark administrators etc unless their home regulator accords equivalence treatment to the Indian infrastructure entities or these entities are endorsed or recognized Such treatment involves ability to call for information supervise inspect and at least potentially impose penalty on Indian entities This amounts to an unfortunate interference in the regulatory architecture in India especially given the fact that these Indian entities meet relevant global standards set by Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures CPMIIOSCO Similar extrajurisdictional overreach is hanging over FBIL as well The potential disruption to forex markets both onshore and NDF can be rather serious That such disruption flows from the action of regulators is not in alignment with the postGFC global consensus on derisking financial markets All regulated entities understand the costs and constraints of compliance It cannot be anyones argument that replicating such obligations for every regulator in every jurisdiction is an efficient arrangement A satisfactory solution to this impending complication needs to be found quickly 21 As we all understand a benchmark is as good as the underlying market Developing good benchmarks is eventually dependent on developing deep and liquid financial markets which is an ongoing and drawnout process Meanwhile effort can focus on improving the integrity and credibility of the benchmark process This requires achieving a balance between good statistical techniques and realistic subjective judgement of both market participants in their role as submitters and benchmark administrators And above all recognizing that every system is in a process of constant evolution While a transition from polled rates to actual traded rates is a justifiable trend in the postGFC world it may serve us well to remember that a traded price is stale its pricing information is no longer relevant Perhaps we would move towards a more relevant basis for benchmarks in the future And that would require all of us to be constantly striving to create better benchmarks 1 Speech delivered by Shri T Rabi Sankar Deputy Governor Reserve Bank of India on November 28 2022 at a

transmission as well as in allocation and absorption of risks entailed in financing Indias growth 1 I am happy to be part of this FIMMDA1 event today I take this opportunity to place on record the RBIs appreciation of the key role played by FIMMDA in the development of financial markets in India 2 In my address this evening I propose to reflect upon some recent financial market developments and our efforts to navigate through them in the prevailing global and domestic environment I shall then touch upon some of our recent initiatives for the development of domestic financial markets and then go on to conclude by expressing our expectations from market participants and market bodies in the way ahead Recent Financial Market Turmoil 3 The recent commentary from the US Fed at Jackson Hole on the future trajectory of US monetary policy has infused substantial volatility into global financial markets with large spillovers and knockon effects on emerging market economies EMEs This episode is yet another demonstration of the point made in my media interview on August 23 2022 that while forward guidance can be a useful policy instrument in an accommodative monetary policy phase it can be quite difficult to provide coherent and consistent guidance in a tightening cycle The difficulty gets further compounded in the current environment of high uncertainty Such forward guidance may even have destabilising effects on financial markets especially if the subsequent policy actions are at variance with earlier pronouncements Central bank communication in the current context has thus become even more challenging than the actual policy actions Notably however financial markets in India have recovered from the lows that they fell to in the immediate aftermath of the Jackson Hole event 4 In this turbulent global environment the resilience exhibited by Indian financial markets reflects the robust macroeconomic fundamentals of the economy and the proactive and strategic policy interventions to mitigate the impact of the two black swan events that have occurred in quick succession the COVID19 pandemic and the war in Europe 5 Experience tells us that markets often tend to overreact to new information which also amplifies volatility Especially in times such as now when geopolitical tensions and synchronised monetary policy tightening come together overshooting often precedes subsequent realignment with the underlying fundamentals Hence it is useful to take stock of Indias macroeconomic fundamentals and buffers and assess them in the current and evolving conditions First India is widely perceived to be among the fastest growing major economies in the world in 20222 when the other major economies may encounter recession or considerable moderation in their growth momentum The favorable growth differential of India provides confidence to investors This is amply reflected in the surge of portfolio flows into India since July 2022 Inflows in August alone at US 75 billion are more than 16 times the net inflows in July Second the recent softening of commodity prices and supply chain pressures have eased the terms of trade shock that India faced in the aftermath of the pandemic and the war With the consequent easing of imported inflation pressures Indias CPI inflation has peaked in April 2022 Further the average Indian basket crude price in August at USD 974 per barrel has turned out to be lower than what we had assumed for the full year USD 105 per barrel in the monetary policy resolution of August 5 In fact Indias inflation is lower than a large number of its trading partners Third the shift in the commodity price outlook is also altering the assessment of Indias current account deficit in 202223 which is now expected to remain well within sustainable levels Fourth at a time when food security is threatened the world over by shortages and soaring prices Indias large buffer stocks of food grains supplement domestic supply and assure food security domestically Fifth Indias foreign exchange reserves of US 561 billion as on August 26 provide a cushion against external shocks as is being demonstrated on a daytoday basis Moreover the reserves are also reinforced by forward assets Sixth the health of our banking system is sound It is well capitalised and well provisioned with improved asset quality This constitutes a key pillar of financial stability and is expected to provide positive spillovers for the financial markets 6 Reflecting these fundamental factors the Indian rupee has moved in an orderly manner in the current financial year so far It has held its own in a world of sharp depreciation across other EME and AE currencies While the US dollar has appreciated by 118 per cent during the current financial year so far the INR has depreciated by 51 per cent which is among the lowest in the world The RBI is in the market on a regular basis providing liquidity and confidence so as to facilitate its smooth and normal functioning 7 Exchange rate stability is an intrinsic element of our overall macroeconomic and financial stability Our endeavour amidst the extraordinary events unfolding globally on an ongoing basis has been to anchor expectations and allow the exchange rate to reflect the fundamentals rather than overshoot Avoiding undue and excessive volatility is a desirable policy objective for all stakeholders while reaping the benefits of a market determined exchange rate regime 8 Price stability provides the anchor for exchange rate stability in the mediumrun The flexible inflation targeting FIT regime provides credibility to the RBIs monetary policy mandate of assigning priority to containing inflation and keeping inflation expectations anchored while keeping in mind the objective of growth While the incoming monthly inflation prints in the nearterm could be bumpy we expect it to moderate in the second half of 202223 and then move within the tolerance band in Q4 and then even lower in Q1202324 Response to the Pandemic and the War in Europe 9 In response to the pandemic as you are well aware the RBI deployed conventional and unconventional monetary policy tools The financing conditions were kept easy Normal functioning of various segments of the financial market was ensured Our communications and forward guidance provided the muchneeded clarity and confidence to the markets both financial and nonfinancial 10 As we adapted to the pandemic the policy approach has been gradually normalised Even as the Indian economy was recovering from the pandemic it faced a setback from the war in Europe which caused fresh supply disruptions and accentuated the earlier ones Inflation became globalized Consequently the response from Central banks has been aggressive leading to synchronized monetary tightening across the world In India the MPC reprioritised price stability as the foremost objective of monetary policy and began a process of withdrawal of accommodation 11 Going forward our monetary policy will remain watchful nimblefooted and calibrated in order to ensure price stability while supporting growth The RBI remains committed to support the market with twoway operations as warranted in line with the revised liquidity management framework The RBI will also strive to ensure stable money market conditions the smooth conduct of the primary auctions in Gsecs and facilitate the orderly evolution of the yield curve Reforms in Regulatory Framework and Financial Markets 12 In spite of the two black swan events that have dominated the recent discourse the RBI has steadfastly persevered with regulatory reforms aimed at the development of the domestic financial markets Our approach is based on the principle of adapting to the needs of a modernising financial market as it integrates with the rest of the world 13 Let me touch upon on some of the regulatory changes which have taken place during the last three years The orderly development of the sovereign yield curve needs significant market liquidity at important benchmark tenor points and supply of GSecs of various tenors to diverse class of market participants matching with their investment requirements To this end the Benchmark Security Issuance Strategy was introduced during 202021 under which government securities gsecs of specific benchmark tenors of 2 5 10 14 30 and 40years are issued This year gsecs with a 7year tenor have also been introduced after market consultation 14 Issuance of green bonds provides a strong signal of a countrys commitment to a lowcarbon economy It also helps in bringing down the cost of capital for green projects Following the announcement in the Union Budget for 202223 the Government and the RBI are putting in place a framework for issuance of Sovereign Green Bonds in line with global standards 15 As part of our continuing efforts to increase retail participation in Gsecs the RBI Retail Direct Scheme was launched in November 2021 to facilitate individual investors to conveniently invest in Gsecs state development loans SDLs and sovereign gold bonds Further to ensure liquidity to the retail investor the Retail Direct Scheme Market Making was notified on January 04 2022 The scheme requires primary dealers to respond to buysell requests from the retail investors throughout market hours 16 The RBI has continuously engaged in ensuring stateoftheart infrastructure for trading settlement and timely dissemination of information in the gsec market An important initiative in this context is the introduction of the Request for Quote RFQ dealing mode on NDSOM in October 2020 The RFQ mode aims to enable market participants to negotiate trades on the NDSOM platform itself for better price discovery 17 Derivative markets play an important role in allowing entities to hedge their risks and improving liquidity for the underlying product Several measures have been taken to rationalise the regulatory framework for forex credit and interest rate derivative markets Principlebased regimes have been implemented in place of prescriptive regulations in a bid to provide greater flexibility and operational freedom to market participants Access of nonresidents to these markets has been eased The access of institutional users to the markets has been facilitated both for hedging and for expressing their views on market movements 18 With these reform measures product due diligence assumes greater importance It would ensure that marketmakers offer products that match the requirement of the users and avoid exposing their clients to excessive risk Considering the recent changes in the regulations relating to OTC derivatives and in line with international standards a regulatory framework for marketmakers in OTC derivatives3 has been put in place to ensure high standards of governance risk management and conduct by market makers 19 We have also continued our efforts towards integrating domestic and offshore INR markets Banks in India with operative IFSC Banking Units were permitted to access the offshore nondeliverable rupee derivative market in 2020 To facilitate integration of offshore and onshore markets for Overnight Indexed Swaps OIS the most active rupee interest rate derivative in the domestic market Banks in India and standalone primary dealers SPDs have been permitted to undertake settlement of OIS transactions with nonresidents in foreign currency 20 Broadly the recent regulatory and institutional reforms have been aimed at enabling the domestic financial markets to face the challenges of the next decade Cutting across market segments these reforms seek to usher in a simplified principlebased regulatory framework that seeks to broadbase markets by easing access enhancing participation facilitating innovation protecting users and promoting fair conduct Market Participants and Market Bodies as Reform Partners 21 It is important to note that achievement of the desired outcomes from the significant changes in the regulatory framework for financial market and its infrastructure is contingent upon market participants taking forward the reform agenda It is heartening to see the market participants rising to the occasion and partnering with the Reserve Bank to meet the challenges of recent years One such instance was the smooth completion of the government borrowing programme despite the increased issuances in the last two years 22 Similarly the move towards normalisation of liquidity conditions in the market has also taken place without any disruption In response to changes in regulation we are seeing our banks becoming active and visible in global markets and coming up with new products to meet the hedging needs of the real sector The transition away from LIBOR has also been achieved with relative smoothness Of course the efforts towards complete transition need to continue as we approach the deadline for the cessation of all US dollar LIBOR settings less than a year away In all of these areas market bodies such as the FIMMDA PDAI4 FEDAI5 and the Indian Banks Association IBA have continued to play an important role in acting as bridges between the market participants and the regulator proactively conveying the views of the market and providing timely inputs for policy making Expectations from Market Participants 23 There are however some areas where performance of market participants can improve further One area has been the delivery of services to the small retail customers While there has been a steady increase in the quantum of secondary market trades under the RBI Retail Direct Scheme there remains considerable scope for improvement in ensuring liquidity for the retail investors throughout market hours on the NDSOM platform We continue to get representations from customers particularly those undertaking forex transactions with small ticket sizes about fair pricing of forex products A research study by some officers in the RBI found empirical evidence of the presence of considerable price discrimination in the OTC currency derivatives market The services provided by banks on the FXRetail platform need special attention The response time and onboarding of customers on the platform can be faster 24 The revised product regulations in OTC derivative markets now permit marketmakers to deal in derivative products of varying complexity and to offer these products only to nonretailinstitutional customers who have the ability to handle the risks associated with such products It has been reassuring to note that market participants and users have been taking a prudent approach in the use of complex products The valuation and the risk management systems of the marketmakers may need to be continually updated Customers also need to be made aware of the unique risks associated with these products 25 The recent reform measures have facilitated greater linkages of the domestic market with the global markets As the footprints of banks in India increase in the offshore markets it is expected that price discovery of rupee products will also consolidate in the onshore market To realise this potential banks need to put in place adequate supporting infrastructure backed by expertise in risk management More so because integrated financial markets can also facilitate faster propagation of shocks which require appropriate risk management processes Conclusion 26 Let me now conclude by stating that market development ultimately is a shared goal of both the regulator and the market participants The RBI has taken steps towards liberalising markets removing barriers and putting in place a facilitative regulatory framework Adoption of new products requires participation from market participants in terms of providing liquidity contributing to price determination and easing operational constraints It is upon the market participants to take the baton forward to develop the market and offer innovative financial products to a broader set of clients The RBI will remain constantly engaged with the market bodies and participants Together we should remain future ready at all times I firmly believe that we can do this I wish FIMMDA all success in its future endeavours and look forward to our continued partnership

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1322&fn=6,Date Corporate Bond Markets in India Challenges and prospects,Wellfunctioning liquid and resilient financial markets help monetary policy transmission as well as in allocation and absorption of risks entailed in financing Indias growth Introduction 1 An active corporate bond market serves multiple functions Apart from providing borrowers an alternative to bank finance corporate bonds can lower the cost of long term funding Banks are typically constrained in lending longterm because their liabilities are relatively of a shorter tenor An efficient corporate bond market with lower costs and quicker issuing time can offer an efficient and costeffective source of longer term funds for corporates At the same time it can also provide institutional investors such as insurance companies and provident and pension funds with longterm financial assets preferred habitat helping them match the durations of their assets and liabilities 2 From a macrofinancial or financial stability perspective a welldeveloped corporate bond market serves to spread risks away from the banking system Banks are key to financial stability as they provide liquidity services credit and payment systems to the economy and it is important to regulate their risktaking activities A marketbased source of finance such as corporate bond market therefore is more effective in dissipating risk across a much wider category of investors thereby contributing to overall financial stability A reasonably developed corporate bond market can play the role of the spare tyre2 mitigating financial shocks and preserving financial stability 3 It is against this background that the Government SEBI and the Reserve Bank have been taking concerted efforts to facilitate the development of the corporate bond market in India I thought I would use this opportunity to dwell upon the various aspects related to the development of this market the journey so far the challenges which have been encountered and share some thoughts on the potential way forward The Regulatory Effort 4 The efforts taken to develop the corporate bond markets broadly over the last decade and a half have been wide ranging The reforms and developments have ranged from advancements in the corporate bond microstructure to the evolution of a facilitative regulatory framework complemented by efforts to develop related risk and derivative markets and measures to enhance secondary market liquidity 5 SEBI the primary regulator of the corporate bond market has taken significant steps over the years to improve the market microstructure for corporate bonds settlement through delivery versus payment DvP mode which removes settlement risk operationalisation of a trade reporting platform for enhancing transparency introduction of an electronic bidding platform EBP for primary issuance consolidation of stock through reissuance introduction of request for quote RFQ platforms and many more RBI has also been taking measures to develop the corporate bond market permitting banks to provide partial credit enhancement PCE to incentivise a larger investor base requiring large borrowers to raise a share about 50 of their incremental borrowings through market instruments encouraging FPI investment by raising investment caps introduction of Voluntary Retention Route etc As entity regulators RBI IRDAI and PFRDA have encouraged their regulated entities to invest in corporate debt securities The Current Status Having gone through the various measures and efforts taken for the development of the corporate bond markets let me now spend a few moments introspecting on the progress made A Resource mobilisation the primary market 6 The growing size of the corporate bond market and the number of issuances every year are important indicators of the success of the development efforts of the Government and regulators Over the years there has been a steady increase in mobilisation of resources through the corporate bond route The outstanding stock of corporate bonds has increased fourfold from 1051 lakh crore as at end of FY 2012 to 4020 lakh core as at end of FY 2022 Chart 1 Annual issuances during this period have increased from 380 lakh crore to close to 60 lakh crore Chart 2 7 The longterm trend of the share of corporate bonds in the flow of resources to the commercial sector in India is reassuring Data from RBIs Handbook of Statistics for the Indian economy shows that ratio of gross private placements by nonfinancial entities a broad proxy for issuances by corporate bonds by nonfinancial entities to nonfood credit has increased from 009 in 201011 to 050 in 202021 Chart 3 8 Admittedly the size of the corporate bond market in India scaled by GDP remains small compared to other major Asian emerging markets such as Malaysia Korea and China Chart 4 But the market is growing steadily Chart 5 and reasonably given the traditional bank dominance 9 The growing size of the corporate bond market is accompanied by growing diversity of issuers and markets We now have issuances by new types of entities eg REITs and InvITs pursuant to the Union Budget announcing changes in several Acts including the SEBI Act 1992 the Securities Contract Regulation Act 1956 and the SARFAESI Act 2002 to provide a legal framework for these entities to issue corporate debt securities The SEBI issuance of regulations on the issue and listing of municipal debt securities has enabled marketbased financing of infrastructure projects Of course more will need to be done to put in place conducive conditions for this sector to develop through for example greater transparency in city budgets credible accounting and financial statements independent audits and monitorable performance criteria Also reassuring are the early signs of the development of a market for distressed corporate debt securities including debt securities issued as part of corporate insolvency processes 10 There are other factors which testify to the development of the corporate bond market in the country and to its increasing resilience A welldeveloped government securities market provides the backbone for the development of other rate markets such as corporate bond market Corporate bonds are generally priced off the sovereign yield curve and resilient markets are characterised by stable credit spreads over benchmark yields of government securities A comparison of the yields of 5year government securities and AAA rated bonds of 5year tenor over the last decade or so in the country clearly indicate that the government securities yield curve has provided a stable backbone for pricing of corporate bonds in the country Chart 6 Trends in the variations of credit spreads has also been reassuring the spreads have widened during times of stress and volatility domestic or global in testimony to the maturity of the corporate bond market in pricing 11 Another reassuring trend about the evolution and maturity of corporate bond markets has been its ability to innovate and adapt Thus when concerns about the credit quality of business firms and their ability to withstand the disruptions of lockdowns were dominating discourse in the early days of the pandemic the corporate bond market innovated with bonds featuring conditional credit risk premium entailed to harmonise the interests of issuers preferring to lock in the low interest rates prevailing then with that of investors concerns about credit quality Similarly while corporate bonds in India are predominantly issued as fixed coupon bonds during the calendar year 2021 increased issuances of floating rate bonds with coupons linked to money market and government securities benchmarks were witnessed indicating efforts by investors to hedge against any increase in domestic interest rates These are important metrics testifying to the resilience of the market in particular is ability to function well in times of stress B Liquidity metrics Developing the secondary market 12 The second important metric to assess the development of a corporate bond market is the development of secondary bond markets Have secondary market trading volumes grown over the years Undoubtedly they have Chart 7 The total settled value of secondary market trades during FY 201011 was 450 lakh crore which rose to 1437 lakh crore for FY 202122 Clearly secondary trading has not risen in consonance with the size of the market 13 But let us pause before passing judgement in this matter A 2019 report on Establishing Viable Capital Markets by the BIS Committee of Global Financial System based on a survey of a sample set of jurisdictions concluded that the degree of liquidity concerns in the corporate bond markets of the surveyed advanced economics barring the US and emerging market economies were similar on average The challenges in development of liquidity in bond markets are thus clearly not unique to the corporate bond markets in India Comparable data on turnover ratios of corporate bond markets of different jurisdictions are not readily available but approximate assessments do not indicate that the Indian corporate bond market lags its peers in respect of secondary market liquidity 14 Let me spend a moment to look at the underlying issues As on June 30 2022 the outstanding stock of corporate bonds stood at 3958 lakh crore8 The number of instruments outstanding was 29745 The average size of an outstanding corporate bond instrument was therefore 133 crore a small amount not conducive to development of liquidity in the secondary market Compare this with the current outstanding stock of government securities at 8471 lakh crore in 100 instruments9 The two markets are not comparable and it is not my intention to compare them There is a single issuer in the government securities market the government compared to 5394 issuers as on June 30 2022 in the corporate bond market Replicating the experience of the Government bond market in the corporate bond market is not a realistic objective SEBI has been progressively making efforts to nudge the market towards reissuances in a bid to reduce fragmentation and improve liquidity in corporate bond markets limiting the number of corporate bonds that could mature in any financial year The constraint is that a corporate does not have the tools available to a Government to meet the rollover risk implicit in bunched up repayment obligations that result from consolidation through reissuance Other factors that contribute to the limited activity in the secondary market are the buy and hold nature of investors and the predominance of private placement C Development of complementary markets 15 It is wellestablished globally that wellfunctioning related markets derivatives and repo markets complement and supplement the development of liquidity in the cash market by enabling investors and marketmakers to better manage risks and fund positions 16 The primary risks associated with holding corporate bonds are interest rate risk and credit risk The interest rate derivative market is reasonably liquid particularly the overnight indexed swaps market Markets for other interest rate derivative products like swaptions are developing Recent regulatory efforts seek to harmonize onshore and offshore markets by on the one hand allowing nonresidents to access the domestic market and on the other hand permitting domestic market makers to access the offshore market Interest rate derivatives are also trading on exchanges though volumes are small 17 The absence of a market for credit derivatives despite regulatory initiatives for more than a decade is a concern To a certain extent there is a chicken and egg problem here The dominance of top rated issuances reduces the need to manage credit risk while development of a Credit Default Swap CDS market is essential for the issuances of lower rated bonds Two recent developments offer hope for the future development of the CDS market The passage of the Act for Bilateral Netting of Qualified Financial Contracts 2020 pursuant to which the Reserve Bank has notified CDSs along with other OTC derivatives as qualified financial contracts for netting In February this year RBI expanded the issuer protection seller and participant base for CDSs to include all major nonbank regulated entities viz primary dealers NBFCs insurance companies pension funds alternate investment funds and mutual funds in addition to banks and foreign investors 18 The market for repo in government securities is one of the most liquid markets in the country But repo in corporate bonds has not taken off Market feedback suggests that issues related to the lack of a trading platform like the one available for repos in government securities lack of a central counterparty high margin requirements etc have impeded the development of the market for repos in corporate bonds SEBI is trying to facilitate the setting up of a repo clearing corporation We keep our fingers crossed that going forward we will see this market too start to develop Issues concerns and challenges 19 Let me now turn to some of the microstructure issues of the corporate bond market in the country which pose concern or which need to be addressed if the market has to take the leap to the next level of development and fulfil its potential as the major avenue for resource mobilisation in the country A Rating profile 20 First as is well known the market is dominated by highly rated issuers But let us look at the dimension of the problem In FY 202122 ratings were assigned to 1235 corporate debt securities amounting to 2255 lakh crore10 Of these 278 or 225 were rated AAA and 358 or 29 were rated AA 66 issuances or 53 of issuances were noninvestment grade While these numbers themselves are skewed in favour of highly rated issuances the skew is much more pronounced when looked at in value terms 80 of issuances in value terms were rated AAA and another 15 were rated AA While we can discuss the reasons for this trend it is clear that the corporate bond market largely meets the needs of highly rated corporates B Mode of issuance 21 The second issue relates to the mode of issuance The large bulk of corporate bond issuances every year is through the private placement route rather than through public issuances In FY 202122 the amount of money raised through public issuances of corporate bonds was 11589 crore just about 2 of the amount of money raised through private placement at 588 lakh crore11 The advantages of a public issuance in terms of transparency and efficiency of price discovery are well understood SEBI has been making efforts to make the private placement process more transparent and efficient for example through the introduction of the Electronic Bidding Process on stock exchanges Nevertheless there is an overwhelming preference for private placement A hard look at the underlying issues including the reasons for issuers preferring to eschew the public issuance process is perhaps called for C Investor profile 22 Third let us look at the investor base The investor base for corporate bonds is as can be expected given the market microstructure largely dominated by domestic institutions insurance companies banks and mutual funds Chart 8 Retail participation in corporate bonds remains low this in fact is a global trend What is somewhat unique in India is that investors in debt oriented mutual funds which is the avenue through which globally the retail investor participates in debt markets are also largely institutional Foreign participation in corporate debt has also not been favorable to secondary market activity 23 The profile of the investor base for the corporate bond markets has had implications for some of the issues and concerns I have flagged earlier I talked of the limited access of lower rated issuers to the corporate bond market for mobilising resources Part of the answer does lie in the investor base in the market which is closely regulated and has a preference for highly rated issuances perhaps justifiably so The economic profile mandate and or regulatory environment of these entities often incentivises buy and hold kind of participation in corporate bond market With a large investor base with this profile the challenges of developing liquidity in the secondary market or of developing liquid repo and derivative markets are compounded To take an example insurance and pension funds are one of the most active participants of credit derivative markets globally both as buyers and sellers of protection Without participation of these entities it may be difficult for the credit derivatives market to develop in the country 24 The question that arises is that what measures may be considered to widen the investor base to enhance accessibility of lower rated issuers and liquidity in the corporate bond market Given the rise in retail investments in the domestic equity market can this category which is conspicuous by its absence in the corporate bond market be offered incentives to broaden the investor base in the market What can be done to attract foreign investment in our markets What can be done by way of incentives for regulated entities to participate more actively in risk markets without compromising on prudential considerations These are questions which need deliberations by all stakeholders Government regulators and the participants of the corporate bond markets themselves D Specialised Bonds 25 In the last couple of years there have been increasing instances of domestic corporates tapping the global markets for raising funds To a large extent this is only to be expected given the large pool of liquidity and benign interest rate environment that was prevailing internationally This is also an inevitable result of greater integration of the domestic economy with the rest of the world But there are a couple of trends which require closer examination 26 A number of our corporates have been tapping international markets to raise Environmental Social Governance ESG funding while domestically such issuances have been low I know a lot of efforts are ongoing but there is perhaps a need for us to look closely at what are the factors impeding the development of the domestic market for ESG bonds and what needs to be done to attract the growing global pool of ESG funds to the country Going by international experience beyond the regulatory measures there is a need to create conducive conditions for ESG bonds greater transparency credible checks against greenwashing including through arrangements for independent audits and a robust taxonomy for the market and bonds The announcement in this years Union Budget referring to mobilisation of resources via Green Bonds is also expected to enable a price anchor for ESG bonds in due course 27 There is a limited investor base for capital bonds issued by banks in India This has resulted in Indian banks accessing global markets for raising capital While any issuer including banks will naturally search for the market where they can most efficiently raise funds there is a need perhaps to look at factors which are impeding domestic appetite for such bonds and whether the factors are aligned to international norms standards E Price Transparency 28 The importance of highquality and timely information on financial markets is basic to the development of the market Most of you will be aware that in the domestic government securities market information about every single trade is disseminated in nearreal time ensuing the highest standards of transparency There has been feedback from market participants about the need for improving the timeliness and integrity of data on primary and secondary market transactions in the corporate bond market This is arguably a low hanging fruit which we can aspire for It has also been highlighted that there is a need for adoption of uniform valuation methodology across investors Valuation by an independent benchmark administrator would be ideal Conclusion 29 Let me conclude now We have made impressive progress in the development of the corporate bond markets the market is large and growing the issuer base is expanding product diversity and sophistication are developing secondary volumes are low but growing and market infrastructure is the best in the world Efforts need to focus on improving complementary repo and derivative markets diversify the investor base both domestic and global and improve access of borrowers at the lower end of the credit spectrum Beyond this market development and improvements will remain a continuous exercise As much as we need to take these steps it will serve us well to temper our expectations on the degree of liquidity in secondary corporate bond markets If international experience is anything to go by the best we can achieve may be well short of the liquidity we are used to in Government bond markets or equity markets Thank you 1 Keynote address

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1122&fn=6,Date Keynote Address at the 21st FIMMDAPDAI Annual Conference on August 31 2021 Shri Shaktikanta Das Governor Reserve Bank of India,Wellfunctioning liquid and resilient financial markets help monetary policy transmission as well as in allocation and absorption of risks entailed in financing Indias growth It is my pleasure to be part of the Annual FIMMDAPDAI Conference today I take this opportunity to place on record the Reserve Banks deep appreciation of the key role played by FIMMDA and PDAI in the development of financial markets in India Both organizations have played a significant role in improving the depth and liquidity of interest rate markets and in supporting primary issuance by the Government Introduction 2 During May last year in one of my statements I had noted that COVID19 has crippled the global economy and that once again central banks have to answer the call to the frontline in defence of the economy It has been more than a year since While there are signs of recovery we are not yet out of the woods 3 The sudden shock delivered by the pandemic called for swift and decisive policy responses Central banks across the globe responded by lowering interest rates expanding their balance sheets through largescale purchase of government securities Gsec and other assets and injecting vast amounts of liquidity into the financial system Many central banks also implemented measures targeting specific market segments that were witnessing heightened stress These measures were in many cases complemented by regulatory relaxations lower capital and liquidity requirements aimed at supporting credit flow from banks and other financial intermediaries and at stabilizing the financial system and restoring confidence in financial markets 4 The Reserve Bank too responded swiftly and undertook several conventional unconventional and innovative measures in the realms of monetary policy liquidity support and regulation The Reserve Bank like most debt managers around the globe was confronted with a highly expanded borrowing programme of the Government Through various measures the Reserve Bank completed the borrowing programme in a nondisruptive manner and also created congenial conditions for other segments of the financial market such as the corporate bond market The stabilisation of credit spreads across the rating ladder resulted in issuances of corporate bonds to the tune of 772 lakh crore in 202021 In my address today I propose to focus on the GSec market which is the single most important financial market in any economy Needless to add that this is a subject of great interest to both FIMMDA and PDAI Distinctive features of the Gsec market 5 The Gsec market is distinct from other financial markets in a fundamental way it is the market in which the riskfree interest rate a key macroeconomic variable is determined Gsec yields act as the benchmark for pricing of most financial assets Without a wellfunctioning Gsec market therefore the financial system cannot function efficiently 6 There are other distinctive features of the Gsec market First globally the Gsec market is predominantly an institutional market with the major participants being banks and longterm investors including investment funds insurance funds retirement funds Second different Gsec instruments are highly substitutable the only differentiating factor being tenor of instruments This is one of the reasons why the Gsec yield curve may be viewed as a public good as I have been emphasizing Third Gsecs provide the most widely used high quality collateral for payment and settlement systems liquidity operations and other financial sector transactions Fourth and this is particularly relevant for a central bank virtually all monetary operations are executed in the Gsec market Monetary transmission is fundamentally linked to an efficient Gsec market in any market economy 7 Let me now highlight some of the important measures taken to develop the Gsec market and how this role provides the Reserve Bank with the critical levers to balance its multiple responsibilities during normal times as well as during periods of stress Evolution of the Government Securities Market in India 8 Within the overarching statutory framework of the RBI Act 1934 the Government Securities Act 2006 and the Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007 the Reserve Bank has enabled the development of When Issued WI trading in Gsecs shortselling repo transactions interest rate derivatives and the like Further to promote integrity transparency and fair access in markets the Reserve Bank has introduced global best practices with the issuance of the Electronic Trading Platforms ETP Reserve Bank Directions in 2018 directions for Prevention of Market Abuse in 2019 and the Financial Benchmark Administrators Reserve Bank Directions in 2019 As a consequence of these efforts the legal and regulatory framework for the Gsec markets has evolved over the years to facilitate efficient management of public debt and development of secondary markets The Supply Side From Monetisation of Debt to Marketbased Debt Management 9 The development of the Gsec market was greatly facilitated by the abolition of automatic monetization of government debt introduction of the auction process for issuance and enactment of FRBM Act 2003 The next phase of reforms was directed towards institutional development including the institution of Primary Dealers PDs establishment of the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd CCIL a central counterparty for guaranteed settlement and formation of market bodies such as the FIMMDA and the PDAI Since December 2015 a mediumterm debt management strategy MTDS has been articulated which revolves around three broad pillars viz borrowing at low cost over a medium term risk mitigation and market development 10 Issuances of Gsecs are made in different maturity buckets enabling the formation of a yield curve up to 40 years Secondary market liquidity is supported by building up issue sizes through reissuances The consequent rollover risk is managed through active consolidation using buybackswitches 11 Transparency in supply was enhanced through the introduction of issuance calendars for auctions in Gsecs since April 2002 Auctions are conducted electronically which ensure transparency as well as efficiency Product diversity is ensured through various instruments including inflationlinked bonds and floatingrate bonds Treasury Bills and Cash Management Bills are issued to smoothen Government cash flows Regulatory provisions for issuance of Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities STRIPS have also been made to facilitate the development of a zerocoupon yield curve and to attract retail investors to the Gsec market Going forward it would be desirable for the Reserve Bank and the market bodies like FIMMDA and PDAI to work together to popularize the STRIPS instrument further Niche products targeted at retail investors also include sovereign gold bonds a government security denominated in gold and savings bonds The Demand Side Resilience amidst Diversity 12 To impart resilience and diversity to the Gsec market several steps have been taken to encourage direct retail participation These steps include provision for noncompetitive bidding in primary auctions and the oddlot segment on NDSOM permitting banksprimary dealers stock exchanges to act as aggregatorsfacilitators for retail investors introduction of products for retail investors etc Interoperability is sought to be enhanced by linking market infrastructure linking exchange trading systems and NDSOM and linking RBIs Subsidiary General Ledger system and the depositories 13 Foreign investors have been permitted to invest in Gsecs subject to prudential limits Recent initiatives like the introduction of the Voluntary Retention Route VRR and Fully Accessible Route FAR have contributed to demand side resilience Nonresident participation in interest rate derivatives markets for hedging as well trading has been permitted The regulatory framework for hedging of foreign exchange risk has been liberalized to incentivize investors to hedge their currency risk onshore Several other measures to promote ease of doing business by foreign investors viz T2 settlement of trades extended timing for reporting of transactions and allowing banks to fund margins for Gsec trades have also been taken Market Infrastructure Stateoftheart Trade and PostTrade Services 14 A sound robust and safe market infrastructure increases the resilience of the Gsec market against external shocks and contributes to price discovery The Reserve Bank has continuously engaged in developing stateoftheart infrastructure relating to trading and posttrade services including settlement reporting and timely dissemination of traded information both in outright and repo markets I can say with all humility that the infrastructure of the Gsec market in India can be regarded as cutting edge in terms of sophistication The NDSOM system of the Reserve Bank an anonymous order matching platform provides multiple functionalities which include trading in standard and odd lot sizes and trading in the whenissued market This is in sharp contrast to most jurisdictions including advanced economies where trading in government bonds is predominantly voicenegotiated or fragmented over multiple Electronic Trading Platforms ETPs The NDSOM is perhaps unique as it i provides unparalleled pre and posttrade transparency ii pools all market liquidity providing a single order book and iii facilitates anonymity in trading thus ensuring fair and nondiscriminatory price discovery even for small investors 15 Complementing the trading infrastructure is a deliveryversuspaymentbased guaranteed settlement mechanism which eliminates settlement risks and through multilateral netting reduces liquidity requirements This is one of the important features of Gsec market in India as not many jurisdictions have central clearing of Gsecs let alone central clearing for all cash and repo transactions in Gsecs at one place In fact there is growing discussion in advanced economies about the need for widespread adoption of central clearing after recent episodes of market dislocation 16 High levels of pretrade and posttrade transparency are achieved through public dissemination of live orders and all trades being executed on NDSOM Tradewise historical data are available to all End of day publication of valuations of Gsecs by an independent benchmark administrator FBIL improves price transparency Complementary Markets 17 Gsec markets need supporting markets in the form of funding markets and risk markets The repo market performs the function of a funding market Similarly interest rate derivative markets enable management of risk Comprehensive directions covering both OTC and exchangetraded derivatives were issued in 2019 rationalising the regulations for eligible institutions permissible instruments exposure limits and reporting Futures and options have been introduced Efforts to make the markets deep and liquid remain ongoing RBI and the Government Securities market 18 Let me now turn to the criticality of the Gsec market for effective discharge of Reserve Banks functions The Reserve Banks multifaceted role as monetary policy authority manager of systemic liquidity government debt manager regulator of interest rate and foreign exchange markets regulator of payment and settlement systems and overseer of financial stability makes the Gsec market critical for the effective discharge of these responsibilities 19 With the development of the domestic financial markets and deregulation of interest rates effective transmission of monetary policy impulses relies on the Gsec market being deep and liquid so as to create the intended impact on interest rates by linking expectations of future shortterm rates to current longterm rates 20 Similarly a wellfunctioning Gsec market ensures efficient discharge of the public debt management function The public debt structure viz quantity composition and ownership of debt also influences monetary conditions In the wake of the pandemic when fiscal response resulted in a sharp increase in government borrowing the market operations conducted by Reserve Bank not only ensured nondisruptive implementation of the borrowing programme but also facilitated the stable and orderly evolution of the yield curve Monetary policy Gsec market regulation and public debt management therefore need to be conducted in close coordination and the primary focus of such coordination is the Gsec market 21 The current arrangements of the Gsec repository residing with the Reserve Bank facilitate seamless conduct of liquidity operations and simultaneous settlement of Gsec trading This provides confidence to investors removes custodial risk and minimises transaction costs Access to real time market intelligence arising from ownership oversight of market infrastructure is critical for finetuning of timely policy responses 22 The Reserve Banks regulation of the Gsec market has also a strong synergy with its role as the banking regulator as banks are the largest category of participants in these markets The importance of this aspect is also highlighted in the recent G30 report which identified the balkanized regulation of US Treasury markets where banking regulations seem to have adversely impacted marketmaking 23 The current regulatory arrangement for Gsecs offers synergies in terms of a unified market for Gsecs repo in Gsecs liquidity and other monetary operations exchange rate management regulation for key derivative markets public debt management and prudential regulation of banks the largest category among market participants The synergy between the Reserve Banks responsibility for key macro market variables interest rates and exchange rates which ensures overall financial market efficiency and its obligation to ensure stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth is wellaccepted Indeed its effectiveness in managing stress in foreign exchange and interest rate markets is made possible by direct access and oversight of the Gsec market Agenda for the Future 24 The size of the Indian Gsec market measured in terms of outstanding stock as a per cent of GDP is large relative to most Asian peers Liquidity measured through average bidask spreads for Indian Gsecs is among the best as per a 2019 BIS study1 The Gsec market has also provided a robust backbone for the development of the corporate bond market 25 Notwithstanding the robust evolution of the Gsec market in India there is scope for further development to remain in sync with the emerging requirements First secondary market liquidity as measured by the turnover ratio is found to be relatively low on several occasions and tends to remain concentrated in a few securities and tenors The yield curve accordingly displays kinks reflecting the liquidity premium commanded by select securities tenors To a certain extent this is the result of the market microstructure in India dominated as it is by buy and hold and long only investors We need to develop a yield curve that is liquid across tenors 26 Second expansion of the investor base is key to further development of the market The RBI together with the Government is making efforts to enable international settlement of transactions in Gsecs through International Central Securities Depositories ICSDs Once operationalized this will enhance access of nonresidents to the Gsecs market as will the inclusion of Indian Gsecs in global bond indices for which efforts are ongoing To encourage direct retail participation in Gsecs RBI has announced the Retail Direct scheme a onestop solution to facilitate investment in government securities by individual investors 27 Third liquidity in Gsecs market tends to dry up during periods of rising interest rates or in times of uncertainty While the market for special repo facilitates borrowing of securities it is worthwhile to consider other alternatives that ensure adequate supply of securities to the market across the spectrum of maturities It may be recalled that discussions were held on the introduction of Securities Lending and Borrowing Mechanism SLBM with a view to augment secondary market liquidity by incentivizing buy and hold type of investors eg insurance companies pension funds to make available their securities to other market participants Useful feedback was received on the subject from the FIMMDA and the PDAI I would urge that these discussions be carried forward with a view to evolving marketbased mechanisms that enable the lending and borrowing of securities as part of overall market development 28 Fourth the interest rate derivatives IRD market has developed over the years with the availability of a wide range of products The only major liquid product however continues to be the Mumbai Interbank Offer Rate MIBOR based Overnight Indexed Swaps OIS market Participation in the IRD markets is also largely limited to foreign banks private sector banks and primary dealers I am happy to note that based on RBI Directions FIMMDA formulated the operational guidelines for trade in swaptions in consultation with market participants and trading in swaptions have commenced It is also an opportune time to consider new instruments to facilitate hedging of longterm interest rate and reinvestment risk by market participants such as insurance companies provident and pension funds and corporates On its part the Reserve Bank will endeavour to ensure adequate liquidity in the Gsec market as an integral element of its effort to maintain comfortable liquidity conditions in the system In my monetary policy statement of August 6 2021 I had set out a roadmap for the gradual restoration of the variable rate reverse repo VRRR auction as the main operation under the revised liquidity management framework announced on February 6 2020 In order to facilitate this process as markets settle down to regular timings and functioning and liquidity operations normalise the Reserve Bank will also conduct finetuning operations from time to time as needed to manage unanticipated and oneoff liquidity flows so that liquid conditions in the system evolve in a balanced and evenly distributed manner Conclusion 29 Government securities are a distinct asset class It is important to appreciate the role the Gsec market plays in the overall macro interest rate environment of the economy Over the years the market for Gsecs and the associated market infrastructure have reached a stage where it could be considered as one among the best in the world These developments have taken place in tandem with efforts to develop and liberalise other key financial markets such as the markets for interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange markets together with efforts to build linkages across different markets and market infrastructure We have come a long way in developing the financial markets in the country but this is a continuous journey and together we can make it even more robust and vibrant Thank you 1 httpswwwbisorgpublcgfs62pdf

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1388&fn=2768,Date Price and Financial Stability Managing Complementarities and TradeOffs,I am delighted to be back at the Kautilya Economic Conclave 2023 This event is emerging as a leading forum for wellrounded discourse on economic and other policy issues of contemporary relevance I am sure the eminent gathering here will contribute richly to the discussions on issues and challenges that confront us today and tomorrow 2 In the opening line of my latest Monetary Policy Statement on October 6 2023 I had referred to Kautilyas emphasis on stability in the macroeconomic context I now propose to share my thoughts on managing the complementarities and tradeoffs associated with price and financial stability I also propose to touch upon the policy mix to achieve these desirable goals and our experience in dealing with these issues in India Evidently the choice of this topic draws inspiration from the nomenclature of this economic conclave 3 But let me first begin by commenting on the current global context The global economy is facing a triad of challenges i slow moderation in inflation which is getting interrupted by recurring and overlapping shocks ii slowing growth and that too with fresh and enhanced obstacles and iii lurking risks of financial instability Central banks with price stability as their primary objective have raised policy rates aggressively while signalling to keep rates higher for longer Some of them have taken a pause on rate hikes Financial stability concerns along with other factors have conditioned this pursuit following the recent banking sector turmoil in some advanced economies Financial markets have become highly sensitive to every piece of new information Policy making has become extraordinarily complex amidst such confluence of factors Increasingly central bankers face tensions between doing too little or doing too much While several central banks may prefer the prudence of overkill somewhat embodied in higher for longer policy stances financial instability risks rise up to restrain them With every shock such as the recent simultaneous surge of crude oil prices bond yields and the US dollar additional dimensions of policy dilemma present themselves and hamstring their responses 4 In such a situation conflict may arise between the requirements of price and financial stability but policymakers have to deftly tread a fine balance as it is important to recognise that price and financial stability reinforce each other in the medium to long term Stability is the foundation of sustained progress As Kautilya explained long ago Which is preferable an immediate small gain or a large gain in the future A large gain in the future is preferable if it is like a seed yielding fruit in the future1 Against this background let me start with the evolution of the idea of price and financial stability in the global context Global Backdrop Evolution of Price and Financial Stability 5 The role of central banks had evolved by the 19th century as they came to be recognised primarily as the lender of last resort LOLR Bagehot 18732 The LOLR principle remains the cornerstone of modern central banking and its scope has widened over time to encompass financial stability in respect of financial markets and institutions Historically therefore financial stability has been the core remit of central banks involving both prevention and management of financial crisis 6 By the second half of the 20th century inflation surges worldwide caused by postwar fiscal activism and recurring oil price shocks in the backdrop of stagnating economic activity resulted in price stability being recognised as the prime objective of central banks As inflation targeting gained ground from the early 1990s a widely accepted view emerged that monetary policy should primarily or perhaps solely focus on price stability with financial stability falling in the domain of prudential regulation and supervision Price stability was increasingly seen as the best guarantee of financial stability 7 The extended period of steady growth and low and stable inflation during the Great Moderation era of 1990s and early 2000s lulled central banks into a sense of complacency with regard to regulation and supervision of the financial system Quietly and in parallel the seeds of financial instability were germinating Soon therefore the conventional wisdom of price stability being an automatic stabiliser of the financial system got wiped off in favour of the view that price stability on its own would not necessarily safeguard financial stability This view was further reinforced by the global financial crisis GFC of 20083 Governor Subbarao 2012 acknowledged this stating that The global financial crisis followed by the euro zone debt crisis has changed the theology of central banking in a fundamental way The orthodoxy of central banking before the 2008 crisis was single objective price stability single instrument shortterm interest rate The crisis came as a powerful rebuke to central banks for having neglected financial stability in their singleminded pursuit of price stability4 8 During the GFC central banks globally undertook large scale monetary stimulus to depress interest rates to ultralow levels and rekindle animal spirits among investors and households These measures were aimed at restoring financial stability in the near term but ended up threatening future price stability thus posing an intertemporal tradeoff between price and financial stability In other words the large scale monetary and fiscal accommodation undertaken to address financial stability risks during the GFC sowed the seeds of inflationary pressures in subsequent years In the meantime central banks had become more proactive on issues of financial stability 9 Central banks again faced a tradeoff between price and financial stability during the COVID19 pandemic as economic activity came to a standstill amidst elevated global commodity prices and disruption of supply chains As the global financial system became awash with stimulusinjected liquidity concerns were raised about the implication of the liquidity glut for price stability With the commencement of the war in Ukraine these concerns materialised and inflation surged to 40year high levels The unprecedented rate hikes which was undertaken by central banks have resulted in large erosion in profitability of some banks in advanced economies Obviously these banks had not adequately factored in the interest rate risks associated with a reversal of the accommodative policy stance pursued during the pandemic The collapse or failure of some of these banks demonstrated the reverse causality of the tradeoff mentioned earlier In other words the measures undertaken during the GFC to restore financial stability sowed the seeds of future price instability risks while this time around after the pandemic and the war the measures to address price stability led to concerns relating to financial instability in some parts of the world 10 Summing up the last two decades have revealed multiple linkages running between financial stability to price stability and vice versa Measures for promoting financial stability can complement or constrain monetary policy depending upon its usage Financial stability measures aimed at effective regulation and supervision of banks nonbanking financial companies NBFCs and markets can enhance monetary transmission and help achieving price stability whereas financial stability measures via extraordinary monetary expansion if not corrected timely can jeopardise price stability Similarly the linkage from price to financial stability also operates in two ways First extended period of low and stable inflation could lead to financial instability through complacency loop as explained earlier and prolonged periods of depressed growth can keep prices in check but they could also lead to financial instability Second periods of high inflation that are addressed by strong monetary policy tightening can deter financial stability if interest rate risks are not adequately factored in It is therefore evident that the relationship between price stability and financial stability depends upon the policy choices that we make The Indian Experience 11 The Reserve Bank with its assigned responsibility to maintain monetary stability and price stability5 also has the larger responsibility of maintaining financial stability as it is the regulator and supervisor of banks and other financial sector entities and markets Unlike price stability financial stability is not specifically defined and not explicitly quantifiable As a result it has been interpreted subjectively specific to the context and circumstances Governor YV Reddy defined financial stability in central banking parlance as Financial Stability refers to the smooth functioning of the financial markets and institutions it does not mean absence or avoidance of crisis but presence of conditions conducive to efficient functioning without serious disruption6 Recent Years 12 This unique combination of Reserve Banks responsibilities monetary policy combined with macroprudential regulation and microprudential supervision has enabled the Reserve Bank to focus on both financial and price stability even during the recent years of multiple overlapping and unprecedented shocks coming one after the other I am referring to the post ILFS crisis COVID19 pandemic war in Ukraine unparalleled tightening of interest rates and financial market volatilities in that order 13 Following the collapse of ILFS in the second half of 2018 almost the entire 2019 necessitated taking measures to intensify the supervision of NBFCs close monitoring of their liquidity and stability conditions infusing system liquidity through innovative instruments like currency buysell swaps restoring market confidence through appropriate communication and backing it up with actual action on several fronts7 14 When the COVID19 pandemic scarred the global economy including India our response was swift and decisive We put in place business continuity measures even before the nationwide lock down was announced8 The policy repo rate was reduced sizeably by 115 bps in a span of two months MarchMay 2020 Unlike advanced economy central banks which eased rates close to the zerolower bound we did not reduce the policy repo rate below our inflation target of 4 per cent Financial conditions were eased substantially by further reducing the reverse repo rate which lowered the floor rate of the Reserve Banks liquidity adjustment corridor This became the effective anchor of money market rates 15 In addition liquidity enhancing measures equivalent to 87 per cent of GDP were announced Our liquidity measures were unique in several ways liquidity was provided only through the Reserve Banks counterparties banks asset purchase programme GSAP was for a limited period of six months collateral standards were not diluted while offering lending facilities and most of these liquidity injection measures were targeted and had preannounced sunset clauses which helped in their orderly unwinding In parallel macroprudential measures like moratorium on repayment of bank and NBFC loans for six months followed by Resolution Frameworks for COVID19 stressed assets were also announced These resolution frameworks were offered for a limited period and were not open ended but subject to achievement of certain financial and operational parameters 16 It may be noted that all these measures were nuanced keeping in mind the price and financial stability challenges they may create in the future Interestingly the Reserve Banks balance sheet size which had expanded to 286 per cent of GDP in 202021 from 246 per cent in 201920 has moderated to about 225 per cent in 202223 going below its prepandemic level9 17 During 2021 the surplus liquidity was gradually migrated from the short end to the longer horizon through variable rate reverse repo VRRR auctions of longer tenors which lifted shortterm rates from ultralow levels thereby obviating financial stability challenges This was done by sensitising the market well in advance through effective communication 18 The period since the onset of the pandemic was an example of how the Reserve Bank could effectively address macrostability consideration of maintaining price stability through conventional and unconventional monetary policy within the flexibility provided by the flexible inflation targeting FIT framework while also addressing financial stability considerations simultaneously The flexibility provided by a dual mandate under FIT of maintaining price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth along with the provision of a tolerance band around the target rate helped us to accommodate large supply side shocks while focusing on immediate growth concerns during the pandemic 19 Subsequently when the shock of Ukraine war struck in 2022 and there was a sudden surge in inflation we quickly changed gears by prioritising inflation over growth and shifting the monetary policy stance from being accommodative to withdrawal of accommodation Further given that the nature of inflation process in India was driven largely by supply side shocks proactive supply side measures taken by the Government aided to temper the price impulses The Current Context 20 After raising the policy repo rate by 250 bps cumulatively between May 2022 and February 2023 with the quantum of rate hikes being calibrated in tune with the evolving inflation outlook we have maintained pause on policy rates in 202324 so far The 250bps hike is still working through the financial system We have also appropriately finetuned our communication to ensure successful transmission of the rate hikes 21 In the prevailing global environment of slowing growth and stubborn inflation especially in the last few miles before reaching the target economic activity in India exhibits resilience on the back of strong domestic demand10 Real GDP growth for 202324 is projected at 65 per cent and India is poised to become the new growth engine of the world 22 We remain extra vigilant on the evolving inflation dynamics Headline CPI inflation has moderated sharply to 50 per cent in September 2023 with correction in vegetable prices The outlook on food inflation however is beset with uncertainties On the positive side core inflation ie CPI excluding food and fuel has eased by around 170 basis points to 45 per cent from its recent peak in January 2023 We have projected headline CPI inflation at 54 per cent for 202324 As evident from our survey of September 2023 there is further progress on anchoring of inflation expectations which entered single digit zone for the first time since the COVID19 pandemic In the current situation monetary policy must remain actively disinflationary to ensure that ongoing disinflation process progresses smoothly 23 On the financial stability front throughout the multiple shocks in the recent period the Reserve Bank has adopted a prudent approach and taken several initiatives to revamp regulation and supervision of banks NBFCs and other financial entities by developing an integrated and harmonized architecture The Indian financial sector has been stable and resilient as reflected in sustained growth in bank credit backed by improved asset quality adequate capital and liquidity buffers and robust earnings growth11 Macro stress tests for credit risk reveal that scheduled commercial banks SCBs would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios The financial indicators of NBFCs are also in line with that of the broader financial system as per June 2023 data There is however no room for complacency because it is during good times that vulnerabilities may creep in hence buffers are best built up during good times Banks NBFCs and other financial sector entities should remain vigilant and complete the pending repairs if any to their houses Roofs need to be fixed walls need to be further strengthened and foundations need to be augmented when the weather is good to withstand potential adverse weather events in the future Conclusion 24 Let me now conclude Price stability and financial stability complement each other In fact price stability is an anchor for financial stability but the tradeoff between the two becomes a close call at times It has been our endeavour to manage these complementarities and tradeoffs as efficiently as possible While according priority to price stability keeping in mind the objective of growth as mandated under the law we treat financial stability as nonnegotiable Our policies and choices of instruments are guided by this holistic approach We have strengthened our macroeconomic fundamentals and buffers and these are imparting resilience to the economy to withstand large shocks and navigate in an increasingly turbulent and uncertain global setting Alan Greenspan the former Fed Chair once said More fundamentally an environment of greater economic stability has been key to the impressive growth in much of the world12 Indias economic performance in recent years lends credence to this view Thank You Namaskar 1 Kautilya The Arthashastra by L N Rangarajan Penguin 1992 2 Lombard Street A Description of the Money Market

complex economy to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth 6 Reddy YV 2006 Financial Sector Reform and Financial Stability speech delivered at 8th Global Conference of Actuaries Mumbai March 10 7 In June 2019 during the post policy press conference I had said clearly that it is our endeavour to ensure that there is no collapse of any large systemically important NBFC or any large NBFC And in that direction we are monitoring the evolving situation and we will see how it moves forward 8 We were perhaps amongst the first few central banks to have set up a special quarantine facility with about 200 officers staff and service providers engaged in critical activities to ensure business continuity in banking and financial market operations and payment systems 9 As on October 13 2023 the balance sheet size was Rs635 lakh crore and based on the estimated nominal GDP of Rs3018 lakh crore in Union Budget 202324 the balance sheet size to GDP ratio is

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1349&fn=2768,Date Financial markets in India In pursuit of stability and development,It is my pleasure to be part of the Annual FIMMDA1PDAI2 Conference today I would like to place on record the Reserve Banks appreciation of the critical role played by FIMMDA and PDAI in the development of financial markets in India over the years and more recently in partnering with the RBI in guiding the markets and the economy through the turbulent times of COVID19 the war in Ukraine and the turmoil in financial markets 2 Today as I speak before keen market players veterans and experts I thought this would be an opportune moment to recapture the journey of our financial markets in the last decade or so and reflect on where we are and what we think about the course ahead An attempt to draw from the past and forge ahead so to speak 3 From the global financial crisis to the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis from the taper tantrum to Brexit from unprecedented quantitative easing to among the most accelerated monetary tightening in recent memory from a pandemic which brought humankind to a standstill to a geopolitical crisis which threatens the world order as it exists today it would not be an exaggeration to say that the world has moved from one storm to another in the years since the global financial crisis 4 Against this backdrop the journey of Indian financial markets has been driven by two key objectives stability and development Crisis management has been a key component of this journey Nonetheless the pursuit of developmental reforms with the key objective of widening and deepening of financial markets was continued even amidst the worst storms The Journey so far 5 Let me take a moment to reflect on the journey of Indian financial markets over the past few decades Right up to the end of the 1980s the Indian economy was characterised by an administered interest rate regime fixed exchange rates a captive government securities market and current and capital account restrictions Policy measures during the decade of the 1990s set the stage for a transition to marketdetermined interest and exchange rates shift to a multiple indicator approach and eventually to flexible inflation targeting in the conduct of monetary policy convertibility in the current account and gradual liberalisation of the capital account The policy measures were bolstered by several key legislative changes the Foreign Exchange Management Act FEMA 1999 the Government Securities Act 2006 the amendments to the RBI Act in 2006 to give explicit regulatory powers to the Reserve Bank over government securities derivatives and money market instruments and the Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007 The Clearing Corporation of India Ltd was set up in 2001 to provide clearing and guaranteed settlement for money government securities forex and derivative markets A Real Time Gross Settlement System RTGS and the NDSOM platform were operationalised A Trade Repository was put in place for derivatives Some of these initiatives became important at a global level only after the G20 rolled out its reforms agenda in the 2009 Pittsburgh Summit 6 After the global financial crisis 2008 the Indian financial markets were nascent but growing The approach to foreign participation in most market segments was cautious Derivative markets the markets for the purpose of hedging risks were limited in terms of participants and products Meanwhile the BIS Triennial survey published in 2013 showed that there was growing interest in the Indian Rupee overseas The onshore and offshore markets for the Rupee however remained segmented with the spreads between the onshore and offshore forex and interest rates being wide Headwinds and Tailwinds 7 Coming to more recent times many of our policies over the last decade have been guided by the learnings from crisis management as well as the developmental objectives our country aspires to achieve As the world moved through one storm after another we were compelled to navigate through the spillovers of major global headwinds 8 Equally compelling in guiding policy were the needs of the economy As the real sector grew over the last decade expectations from the financial markets also grew The needs of the economy reflect these developments To place this in perspective lets look at some figures Nominal GDP increased fourfold from 64 lakh crore for FY 2010 to 273 lakh crore for FY 20233 External trade also increased over fourfold from 29 lakh crore to 137 lakh crore during the same period4 The ratio of trade to GDP5 has risen to 45 in 2021 from 25 in 2000 Foreign Direct Investment FDI6 in the country has risen sharply by two and a half times since 2010 The flow of resources to the commercial sector in India almost doubled from 12 lakh crore in FY 2012 to 22 lakh crore in FY 20227 While banks continue to be a dominant source of financing market borrowings8 of the commercial sector increased from 74000 crore in FY 2012 to 316000 crore in FY 2022 As our economy and financial markets grew the integration with the world economy and global financial markets has also risen The growing economy and our aspirations to be and remain among the fastest growing economies has expanded our funding needs All these necessitate larger and deeper financial markets The policy response to headwinds 9 It is relevant to look at some of our policy responses in recent times especially to major global headwinds Each successive episode of turmoil over the last decade and half has posed a specific set of challenges for the economy Each has warranted a specific response 10 In 2008 policy actions were aimed at ensuring comfortable system liquidity augmenting forex reserves and maintaining a crisis management framework to support the economy through the global financial crisis Conventional tools such as policy interest rates and cash reserve ratio CRR were used Measures to manage forex liquidity included inter alia relaxing the interest rate ceiling on foreign currency deposits by nonresident Indians and external commercial borrowings ECB for corporates Unconventional measures included a rupeedollar swap facility for Indian banks a refinance window for mutual funds and a special purpose vehicle for supporting nonbanking financial companies 11 Post the announcement of early taper of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve in 2013 the need for restoring confidence of market participants and containing the pressure on the Rupee guided the Reserve Banks policy responses Monetary conditions were tightened through unconventional tools Forex market measures included both direct intervention and administrative measures to manage capital flows These included import restrictions of nonessential items opening of a special dollar swap window for PSU oil companies a concessional swap window for Foreign Currency NonResident FCNRB deposits increased overseas borrowing limits of banks enhanced foreign investment limits in government debt and restrictions on outward investment flows Liberalised Remittance Scheme LRS entitlements as well as exchangetraded derivatives 12 The outbreak of the COVID19 pandemic in March 2020 necessitated swift and focussed policy responses to address the emerging or potential market dislocations As in the past policy rates were reduced and systemic liquidity was expanded But this time the policy corridor was asymmetrically widened and the fixed rate reverse repo became the effective anchor for the evolution of short and longerterm interest rates To improve transmission of policy rates and ensure flow of credit to the affected sectors unconventional measures were used viz the LongTerm Repo Operations LTROs targeted LTROs and special refinance facilities to All India Financial Institutions A special liquidity facility for mutual funds aimed at assuaging redemption pressures was also instituted For the first time the Reserve Bank pledged its balance sheet to revive the economy through a Government Securities Acquisition Programme GSAP which provided an upfront commitment on the amounts to be purchased Special open market operations involving simultaneous purchase and sale of securities Operation Twist were undertaken for orderly evolution of the yield curve and liquidity management Forward guidance gained prominence with the emergence of time and statecontingent guidance with assurances on the Reserve Banks commitment to maintain congenial financial conditions Communication became a significant part of our monetary policy toolkit 13 The onset of the war in Ukraine again weakened risk sentiment with commodity prices and inflation rising to multidecade highs As major central banks accelerated policy rate hikes and tightened liquidity to tackle inflationary pressures financial market volatility spiralled and the Rupee came under considerable pressure The policy response this time eschewed administrative measures to contain outflows and instead focused on measures to enhance inflows through incentivising nonresident deposits foreign investments in debt instruments and ECBs To promote exports and support the increasing global interest in the Rupee an additional arrangement for invoicing payment and settlement of exports imports in Rupees was put in place 14 The point I want to emphasise here is that while there were clear common strands in the Reserve Banks response to various episodes of turmoil the response was customised to each episode in terms of policy objectives and choices and use of toolkits Every response was a function of the underlying macroeconomic conditions and reflected learnings from earlier crises In this context I would like to mention three distinctive features of our policy responses First all liquidity management operations by the Reserve Bank including measures for mutual funds and NBFCs have always been through banks which are the liquidity conduits for the Reserve Bank even in peace times Second the measures entailed no dilution of collateral standards and ensured that the central bank remained cushioned from counterparty risks Third most of the measures this time around were timebound and expired as per their originally defined maturity Illustratively the GSAP was discontinued relaxations with respect to CRR were allowed to normalise and the liquidity management framework was tweaked in April 2022 to operationalise the standing deposit facility SDF This approach has enabled us to get out of a potential liquidity trap the Chakravyuh 15 Interestingly and perhaps paradoxically the measures to reform and develop financial markets have taken place at an unprecedented pace during a decade of unprecedented challenges The reforms were aimed at deepening onshore financial markets and increasing the efficiency of price discovery The more recent reforms sought to i remove market segmentation by simultaneously easing access of nonresidents to domestic markets and permitting residents to access offshore markets ii expand the participation base by encouraging nonresident participation in financial markets and retail participation through the provision of easy access for example through the Retail Direct and FX Retail platforms iii facilitate more sophisticated users to access markets for their hedging needs and to express their views on market movements iv promote innovation through the introduction of a larger suite of products which can be customised to the needs of individual market participants9 and v ensure fair user conduct through protection of the retail user and a sound receptive and a customer suitability framework A robust infrastructure and conduct framework has been put in place through efficient clearing and settlement arrangements benchmark reforms transparency requirements and stipulations on market abuse among others 16 India has also come a long way towards achieving higher levels of capital account convertibility Liberalisation of Foreign Direct Investment FDI flows continued over the last decade with FDI becoming unrestricted except in certain sensitive strategic sectors Limits for nonresident investments in domestic market markets were liberalised The Voluntary Retention Route VRR was introduced to facilitate nonresident investment in government and corporate bonds A Fully Accessible Route FAR which places no limit on nonresident investment in specified benchmark government securities was introduced as part of further liberalisation of portfolio debt inflows The ECB framework was comprehensively liberalised and is now subject only to an overall soft limit and a few end use restrictions Regulations for Overseas Direct Investments ODI have also been rationalised and liberalised The LRS is now available for both current and capital account transactions Where do we stand today 17 In the aftermath of multiple shocks the global economy is projected to contract significantly in 2023 The worst for the global economy both in terms of growth and inflation seems to be behind us Lately with some ebbing of COVIDrelated restrictions and cooling of inflation in various countries though still elevated central banks have started what appears to be a pivot towards lower rate hikes or pauses At the same time they continue to emphatically reiterate their resolve to bring inflation down closer to targets High policy rates for a longer duration appear to be a distinct possibility going forward On the growth front projections are now veering around to a softer recession as against a severe and more widespread recession projected a few months back 18 In this hostile and uncertain international environment the Indian economy remains resilient drawing strength from its macroeconomic fundamentals Our financial system remains robust and stable Banks and corporates are healthier than before the crisis Bank credit is growing in double digits India is widely seen as a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy world Our inflation remains elevated but there has been a welcome softening during November and December 2022 Core inflation however remains sticky and elevated 19 On the external front deglobalisation and protectionism are gaining ground as witnessed during the recent global supplychain shock It is thus necessary to build and strengthen bilateral trade relations to deal with such challenges India has recently signed bilateral trade agreements with the UAE and Australia and more such agreements are works in progress The average current account deficit to GDP ratio stands at 33 per cent during H1202223 The slowing global demand is weighing on merchandise exports but our exports of services and remittances remain strong The net balance under services and remittances remains in a large surplus partly offsetting the trade deficit Consequently the current account deficit is eminently manageable and within the parameters of viability 20 On the financing side net FDI flows remain strong and foreign portfolio flows have resumed since July 2022 with intermittent outflows from time to time The size of forex reserves is comfortable and has gone up from USD 524 billion on October 21 2022 to USD 572 billion as on January 13 2023 Further Indias external debt ratios are low by international standards This has enabled the Reserve Bank to eschew measures to control capital flows and take steps to further internationalise the domestic currency even during episodes of significant capital outflows 21 Every global riskoff episode resulted in an appreciating US dollar imposing downward pressures on most other currencies Comparison of the performance10 of the Rupee across successive crisis episodes tells its own tale During the global financial crisis the Rupee witnessed its worst depreciation between April 1 2008 and March 3 2009 when it lost 23 against the US dollar Similarly it depreciated by 22 during the taper tantrum between May 01 2013 and Aug 28 2013 However the extent of Rupee depreciation was lower in each subsequent episode of turbulence In the initial days of the pandemic ie between February 17 2020 and April 21 2020 the Rupee depreciated by only 7 Even during the period of geopolitical tensions emerging out of Ukraine in 2022 while the Rupee lost 9 against the US dollar between February 24 2022 and October 19 2022 it outperformed the currencies of most advanced and many emerging market economies 22 Importantly the Rupees performance in terms of volatility remained impressive For example the 1month implied volatility of the Rupee touched a high of 25 during the global financial crisis on October 10 2008 and 20 during the taper tantrum period on August 29 2013 During the COVID19 pandemic however the implied volatility peaked at 10 on March 24 2020 and has remained well anchored11 thereafter despite the uncertainties associated with the war and monetary tightening by major central banks The Government bond market has also remained resilient with average bidask spreads being the lowest among peer nations The yield curve has also evolved in an orderly manner without any undue volatility despite the significantly higher government borrowing Looking ahead 23 Today when we look ahead we still see challenges but we can prepare for them with optimism and confidence The Indian financial markets have developed appreciably over the years Liquidity in the government securities and the overnight money markets have grown Bidask spreads remain narrow reflecting efficiency in price discovery In the forex market overall trading volumes have grown and a suite of hedging products have emerged Volumes in the interest rate swap market have grown consistently and new products in these markets are also developing Onshore and offshore markets are getting increasingly integrated with narrowing of forex and interest rates across the markets Nonresident participation in markets is growing albeit gradually 24 The global economy is still marred by shocks and uncertainty Financial markets remain volatile and the geopolitical situation continues to be tense International food energy and commodity prices have eased but uncertainties do remain Inflation remains high and broadbased across countries The IMF has projected contractions in over onethird of the global economy 25 In India we have come a long way in the development of financial markets but this remains work in progress The Reserve Bank and stakeholders like FIMMDA and PDAI need to work together and focus on certain specific areas Secondary market liquidity in gsecs is concentrated in a few securities and tenors The MIBORbased OIS remains the only major liquid product in the interest rate derivative market A term money market remains absent notwithstanding a host of facilitative policy measures Access of the retail segment to markets especially derivative markets needs to improve further In the forex markets while corporates benefit from the tight bidask spreads smaller users continue to face pricing disadvantages notwithstanding regulatory requirements for fair and transparent pricing Likewise there remains a need for improvement in ensuring liquidity for retail investors in the government securities markets Conclusion 26 The journey of Indian financial markets through the last decade has been a story of steady progress with stability We have been steadfast in our commitment and consistent in our approach to keep the ship stable while continuing to move ahead Going forward greater challenges will emerge as the footprints of Indian banks increase in the offshore markets the range of products expand nonresident participation in domestic markets grows and as capital account convertibility increases Market participants will have to prepare themselves to manage the changes and the risks associated with globally integrated markets The achievement of desired outcomes is contingent on financial institutions and market participants taking forward the reform agenda so that we have more vibrant and resilient financial markets Thank you

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1104&fn=2768,Date Towards a Stable Financial System,At the outset let me pay my homage to Shri Nani A Palkhiwala and his grand legacy as a nation builder of modern India I would also like to convey my sincere appreciation to the Palkhivala Foundation for continuing the tradition of organising Shri Palkhivala Memorial Lectures I consider it as a great honour to be delivering the 39th Shri Palkhivala Memorial Lecture today more so among others because he was very closely associated with the RBI during his tenure as a member of the Central Board from 1963 to 1970 Gleaning through the history of the RBI I gather that he participated actively in discussions of the Central Board on important issues spanning bank nationalisation external aid and development finance institutions He invariably brought insightful perspective to the deliberations on various issues Shri Palkhivala was a strong votary of enhancing competition in the banking sector and nurturing native entrepreneurial capabilities to spur economic progress These issues continue to be relevant even in the present times 2 The immensity of Shri Palkhivalas lifelong contributions to the Indian society is well known He was a gifted jurist who held the constitution economic and individual freedoms in highest regard His conduct and integrity during the epochal Kesavananda Bharti case and in many other cases underlined the strength of his character profound intellect and a heart full of empathy for the citizens of this country 3 Shri Palkivala was an orator par excellence both inside and outside the courtroom Starting in 1958 his famous postbudget speeches are still remembered for their eloquence intelligence and sharp wit With growing audience every year the venue of Palkhivalas speeches on budget kept getting shifted to bigger places In 1983 when it was held in the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai Vijay merchant the President of the Cricket Club of India while welcoming the gathering had remarked1 Mr Palkivala has brought the crowds back to the Brabourne stadium since test matches had been shifted to the newly constructed Wankhede stadium 4 The topic of my lecture today is Towards a Stable Financial System The year bygone could be marked as one of the toughest periods for human society The unprecedented health and economic catastrophe caused by the COVID19 pandemic has exposed and widened economic and societal fault lines across countries It is therefore essential to evolve a prudent and judicious approach towards managing the financial system not only during the pandemic but also in its aftermath I Changing Contours of Financial Stability 5 Globally the concept of financial stability has been evolving over time With increasing complexity of the financial system the focus of financial stability has moved beyond commercial banks and providing them liquidity during bank runs to other segments like nonbank financial institutions financial markets payment systems etc The focus area has thus widened to several other pressure points to prevent financial instability Not surprisingly therefore preservation of financial stability has steadily evolved to become a major objective among central banks implicitly or explicitly alongside traditional and evolving goals of monetary policy 6 Since the global financial crisis GFC of 2008 financial stability has featured even more prominently in the discourse of central banks It has been well documented that central banks in many countries were narrowly focused on price stability and perhaps overlooked the buildup of financial instability during the great moderation period The precrisis consensus was for unfettered financial sector growth and minimal regulation that was supposed to deliver even more growth The 2008 crisis made it abundantly clear that financial strength of individual institutions does not add up to systemic stability That was evident because before the crisis happened almost every financial institution reported substantial capital adequacy This made the policy makers realise that while microprudential regulations would help determine the strength of a financial entity they have to be complemented with adequate macroprudential regulations and antisystemic risk measures Preserving systemic stability thus emerged as the cornerstone of central bank policies 7 In the Indian context maintaining financial stability remains one of the uppermost objectives of the Reserve Bank drawing from its wide mandate as the regulator of the banks NBFCs and payment systems regulator of the money forex government securities and credit markets and also as the lenderofthelast resort This unique combination of responsibilities monetary policy combined with macroprudential regulation and microprudential supervision has allowed the Reserve Bank to exploit the synergies across various dimensions 8 The conceptual underpinnings of financial stability as it evolved postGFC entailed preserving and nurturing a wellfunctioning financial architecture which includes not just the banks but also other financial institutions along with efficient and secure payment and settlement systems Recent experience across countries during the pandemic suggests that even though banks nonbanks financial markets and payment systems remain at the core of financial stability issues there is still a need to look much closer at the system in its entirety In this sense the overall objective of financial stability policies should be closely intertwined with the health of the real economy More precisely given that the financial system works as a pivot between various sectors of the economy and given the strong linkages across sectors financial stability needs to be seen in a broader perspective and must include not just the stability of the financial system and monetary stability price stability but also fiscal sustainability and external sector viability All these operate in a feedback loop and disturbances in any of the segments do get propagated to other segments with the potential of disrupting systemic stability 9 When we look at financial stability from such a perspective preserving and nurturing the same becomes a public good which should facilitate creation and nurturing of congenial underlying conditions for sustained growth and development In difficult circumstances such as the current one it is important that all stakeholders recognise and partake in their shared responsibility for the collective benefit of the society at large History is replete with examples of such endeavours in response to difficult situations and that in essence has been the story of human progress and modern economies II Preserving Financial Stability during COVID19 10 The idea of financial stability in this broader sense moulded the Reserve Banks approach during the pandemic which was a unique crisis more challenging than the global financial crisis of 2008 impacting both the real and financial sector in great severity With conventional unconventional and new tools the Reserve Bank responded through a series of measures to alleviate stress in various segments of the economy and the financial sector including the stress encountered by market players and financial entities Broadly speaking our approach to the Covid situation included the following measures a Measures to mitigate the immediate impact of the pandemic loan moratoriums together with asset classification standstill easing of working capital financing and deferment of interest restructuring of MSME loans etc b Liquidity augmenting measures LTRO TLTROrefinance schemes for various sectors including stressed sectors reduction in CRR and other measures totalling about 1281 lakh crore 63 per cent of nominal GDP of 201920 c Countercyclical regulatory measures to ease stress on borrowers and the banking system relaxation in regulatory compliance conservation of capital by banks relaxation in group exposure norms etc d Measures to ensure uninterrupted flow of credit significant interest rate cuts 115bps assuring markets of easy financing conditions exemption from CRR maintenance for incremental retail and MSME loans extension of priority sector classification for bank loans to NBFCs for onlending rationalisation of risk weights for regulatory retail portfolio and individual housing loans etc e Framework for resolution of Covidrelated stress for individuals and businesses f Closer surveillance of supervised entities focusing on business process resilience and continuity proactive management of risks stress tests and proactive raising of capital etc 11 Our principal objective during this pandemic period was to support economic activity and looking back it is evident that our policies have helped in easing the severity of the economic impact of the pandemic I would like to unambiguously reiterate that the Reserve Bank remains steadfast to take any further measures as may be necessary while at the same time remaining fully committed to maintaining financial stability III Adaptations and Learnings Way Forward 12 The recent period has given us an opportunity to learn and adapt and decide on the way forward In todays lecture I would like to focus on three key areas i stability of the banking and nonbanking financial sector ii external sector stability and iii fiscal stability Let me first focus on the banking and nonbanking financial sectors Governance Reforms 13 Integrity and quality of governance are key to good health and robustness of banks and NBFCs Recent events in our rapidly evolving financial landscape have led to increasing scrutiny of the role of promoters major shareholders and senior management visvis the role of the Board The RBI is constantly focussed on strengthening the related regulations and deepening its supervision of financial entities 14 A good governance structure will have to be supported by effective risk management compliance functions and assurance mechanisms These constitute the first line of defence in matters relating to financial sector stability Some of the integral elements of the risk management framework of banks would include effective early warning systems and a forwardlooking stress testing framework Banks and NBFCs need to identify risks early monitor them closely and manage them effectively The risk management function in banks and NBFCs should evolve with changing times as technology becomes all pervasive and should be in sync with international best practices In this context instilling an appropriate risk culture in the organisation is important This needs to be driven by the Board and senior management with effective accountability at all levels 15 In addition to a strong risk culture banks and nonbanks should also have appropriate compliance culture Cost of compliance to rules and regulations should be perceived as an investment as any inadequacy in this regard will prove to be detrimental Compliance culture should ensure adherence to not only laws rules and regulations but also integrity ethics and codes of conduct 16 A robust assurance mechanism by way of internal audit function is another important component of sound corporate governance and risk management It provides independent evaluation and assurance to the Board that the operations of the entity are being performed in accordance with the set policies and procedures The internal audit function should assess and contribute to improvement of the organisations governance risk management and control processes using a systematic disciplined and riskbased approach 17 In all these areas the RBI has already taken a number of measures and will continue to do so from time to time Recent efforts in this direction were geared towards enhancing the role and stature of the compliance and internal audit functions in banks by clarifying supervisory expectations and aligning the guidelines with best practices Some more measures on improving governance in banks and NBFCs are in the pipeline Supervisory Initiatives 18 In the last two years the Reserve Bank has initiated a series of measures to strengthen its supervisory framework over SCBs UCBs as well as NBFCs The supervisory functions pertaining to these sectors are now integrated with the objective of harmonising the supervisory approach The possibility of working in silos has been eliminated We have developed a system for early identification of vulnerabilities to facilitate timely and proactive action We have been deploying advances in data analytics to offsite returns so as to provide sharper and more comprehensive inputs to the onsite supervisory teams The thrust of the Reserve Banks supervision is now more on root causes of vulnerabilities rather than dealing with symptoms Bankwise as well as systemwide supervisory stress testing adds a forwardlooking dimension for identification of vulnerable areas A riskbased supervision framework focussing on know your customer KYCanti money laundering AML risk has been created in line with global practices Fintech initiatives are being embraced in the form of innovative technologies for regulation RegTech and supervision SupTech 19 As regards regulatory intervention in banks to protect the interest of depositors our approach in recent times has been to first work closely with the management to find a workable solution When this does not work we have intervened and put in place a new arrangement within a quick time schedule With preservation of financial stability and depositors interest being uppermost in our agenda we could swiftly resolve the situation at two scheduled commercial banks Notwithstanding improvements being made it is recognised that enhancing and refining the supervisory framework is a continuous process The RBI remains strongly committed to preserve the stability of the financial sector We will do whatever is necessary on this front Recapitalisation of Banks 20 Going ahead financial institutions in India have to walk a tightrope in nurturing the economic recovery within the overarching objective of preserving longterm stability of the financial system The current COVID19 pandemic related shock will place greater pressure on the balance sheets of banks in terms of nonperforming assets leading to erosion of capital Building buffers and raising capital by banks both in the public and private sector will be crucial not only to ensure credit flow but also to build resilience in the financial system We have advised all banks large nondeposit taking NBFCs and all deposittaking NBFCs to assess the impact of COVID19 on their balance sheet asset quality liquidity profitability and capital adequacy and work out possible mitigation measures including capital planning capital raising and contingency liquidity planning among others 21 Preliminary estimates suggest that potential recapitalisation requirements for meeting regulatory norms as well as for supporting growth capital may be to the extent of 150 bps of Common Equity TierI capital ratio for the banking system2 Prudently a few large public sector banks PSBs and major private sector banks PVBs have already raised capital and some have plans to raise further resources taking advantage of benign financial conditions This process needs to be put on the fast track External Sector Stability 22 Given that the domestic financial sector closely interacts with external sector through various channels it becomes a critical segment from a financial stability perspective A weak external sector can pose a threat to domestic financial stability in the face of swift changes in the global economic environment as was the case during the GFC 2008 or the tapertantrum period 2013 External sector conditions are generally captured through movements in current account balances capital flows exchange rates foreign exchange reserves and external debt position Sudden changes in any of these indicators due to global shocks andor domestic developments can impact the viability of external sector and its interaction with the domestic economy 23 Notwithstanding the worsening of both external and domestic demand conditions impinging on exports and imports since the onset of COVID19 Indias external sector has remained resilient Lower trade deficit driven by steeper fall in imports coupled with resilient net exports of services translated into a large current account surplus to the tune of 31 per cent of GDP in H1202021 With surplus in the current account the scope of absorption of strong inflows of foreign direct investment and portfolio investments by the economy was limited which led to a large accretion in foreign exchange reserves 24 Sustained accretion to foreign exchange reserves has improved reserve adequacy in terms of conventional metrics such as i cover for imports 184 months and ii reserves to shortterm debt in terms of residual maturity 236 per cent Sound external sector indicators augur well for limiting the impact of spillovers of possible global shocks and financial stability concerns as investors and markets are credibly assured of the buffer against potential contagion While abundant capital inflows have been largely driven by accommodative global liquidity conditions and Indias optimistic mediumterm growth outlook domestic financial markets must remain prepared for sudden stops and reversals should the global risk aversion factors take hold Under uncertain global economic environment EMEs typically remain at the receiving end In order to mitigate global spillovers they have no recourse but to build their own forex reserve buffers even though at the cost of being included in currency manipulators list or monitoring list of the US Treasury I feel that this aspect needs greater understanding on both sides so that EMEs can actively use policy tools to overcome the capital flow related challenges At the Reserve Bank we are closely monitoring both global headwinds and tailwinds while assessing domestic macroeconomic situation and its resilience Fiscal Stability 25 The COVID19 pandemic has further brought to the fore the need for governments to spend on merit goods and public goods in particular on improving human and social capital and on physical infrastructure IMF 2020 As per IMFs calculations the total fiscal support in response to COVID19 amounted to about 12 per cent of global GDP by midSeptember 2020 Global public debt is said to reach 100 per cent of GDP in 2020 As a result most economies are expected to emerge from the pandemic with higher deficits and debt vulnerabilities Under these circumstances and given the expenditure requirements to support the process of economic revival fiscal stability becomes an even more important constituent of overall financial stability 26 Although the scale of fiscal spending is expected to breach the quantitative targets of fiscal prudence across most economies in the shortrun it was crucial in the context of the pandemic from the perspective of welfare aspect of public expenditure Expenditure on physical and social infrastructure including human capital science and technology is not only welfareenhancing it also paves the way for higher growth through their higher multiplier effect and enhancement of both capital and labour productivity Under these circumstances and going forward it becomes imperative that fiscal roadmaps are defined not only in terms of quantitative parameters like fiscal balance to GDP ratio or debt to GDP ratio but also in terms of measurable parameters relating to quality of expenditure both for center and states While the conventional parameters of fiscal discipline will ensure medium and longterm sustainability of public finances measurable parameters of quality of expenditure would ensure that welfarism carries significant productive outcomes and multiplier effects Maintaining and improving the quality of expenditure would help address the objectives of fiscal sustainability while supporting growth IV Concluding observations 27 Looking ahead our financial system faces both challenging times and new opportunities as the Indian economy returns to full vitality New vistas of financial intermediation leveraging on technology and new business models will emerge With the exponential growth of digitisation and online commerce in India the Reserve Bank has also directed its policy efforts to put in place a state of the art national payments infrastructure while ensuring a safe secure efficient costeffective and robust payments ecosystem The Reserve Bank is positioning itself to provide an enabling environment in which regulated entities are catalysed to exploit these new avenues while maintaining and preserving financial stability The regulated entities on their part need to strengthen their internal defences to identify emerging risks early and manage them effectively Financial stability is a public good and its resilience and robustness needs to be preserved and nurtured by all stakeholders We need to support economic revival and growth we need to preserve financial stability Thank you 1 Bakhtiar K Dadabhoy

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1097&fn=2768,Date Indian Economy at a Crossroad A view from Financial Stability Angle,A very warm good morning to you all I wish to thank the State Bank of India for inviting me to deliver the keynote address today I sincerely appreciate the efforts of the organising team in putting together this virtual conference which has now become a new normal Banks and other financial entities are today at the forefront of the countrys counter measures against the economic impact of COVID19 They are the transmission channels for RBIs monetary regulatory and other policy measures They are the implementation vehicles for the financial backstop measures announced by the government 2 The outbreak of COVID19 pandemic is unambiguously the worst health and economic crisis in the last 100 years during peace time with unprecedented negative consequences for output jobs and wellbeing It has dented the existing world order global value chains labour and capital movements across globe and needless to say the socioeconomic conditions of large section of world population 3 The COVID19 pandemic perhaps represents sofar the biggest test of the robustness and resilience of our economic and financial system In the extraordinary circumstances that we face today history could provide us with some useful guidance with respect to the role of central banks Guided by the ageold wisdom summarised in Bagehots dictum1 that ascribes the role of Lender of Last Resort LOLR to the central bank the Reserve Bank of India has taken a number of important historic measures to protect our financial system and support the real economy in the current crisis While the eventual success of our policy responses will be known only after some time they appear to have worked so far While reiterating our intent and dedication to steer the economy through the crisis I would like to highlight certain key aspects of our policy measures I Monetary Policy Measures 4 Monetary policy was already in an accommodative mode before the outbreak of COVID19 with a cumulative repo rate cut of 135 basis points between February 2019 and the onset of the pandemic Reversing the slowdown in growth momentum was the key rationale for this distinct shift in the stance of monetary policy even as unseasonal rains caused temporary spikes in food inflation in the second half of 201920 Consistent with this policy stance liquidity conditions were also kept in ample surplus all through since June 2019 The lagged impact of these measures was about to propel a cyclical turnaround in economic activity when COVID19 brought with it calamitous misery endangering both life and livelihood of people 5 Given the uncertainty regarding the evolution of the COVID curve it was absolutely critical to anticipate the emerging economic risks and take proactive monetary policy actions of sizable magnitude using a comprehensive range of policy instruments to optimise policy traction The fastchanging macroeconomic environment and the deteriorating outlook for growth necessitated offcycle meetings of the Monetary Policy Committee MPC first in March and then again in May 2020 The MPC decided to cumulatively cut the policy repo rate by 115 basis points over these two meetings resulting in a total policy rate reduction of 250 basis points since February 2019 Liquidity Measures 6 The conventional and unconventional monetary policy and liquidity measures by the Reserve Bank have been aimed at restoring market confidence alleviating liquidity stress easing financial conditions unfreezing credit markets and augmenting the flow of financial resources to those in need for productive purposes The broader objective was to mitigate risks to the growth outlook while preserving financial stability The liquidity measures announced by the RBI since February 2020 aggregate to about 957 lakh crore equivalent to about 47 per cent of 201920 nominal GDP II Financial Stability and Developmental Measures 7 Heading into the pandemic the financial system of the country was in a much improved position owing mainly to various regulatory and supervisory initiatives of the Reserve Bank We had put in place a framework for resolution of stressed assets in addition to implementing multiple measures to strengthen credit discipline and to reduce credit concentration For the five years between 201516 and 201920 the Government had infused a total of 308 lakh crore in public sector banks PSBs As a result of the efforts by both the Reserve Bank and the Government the overhang of stressed assets in the banking system had declined and capital position had improved As per available numbers some of which are provisional at this point of time the overall capital adequacy ratio for scheduled commercial banks SCBs stood at 148 per cent as in March 2020 compared to 143 per cent in March 2019 The CRAR of PSBs had improved from 122 per cent in March 2019 to 130 per cent in March 2020 The gross NPA ratio and net NPA ratio of SCBs stood at 83 per cent and 29 per cent in March 2020 compared to 91 per cent and 37 per cent as on March 2019 respectively The Provision Coverage Ratio PCR improved from 605 per cent in March 2019 to 654 per cent in March 2020 indicating higher resiliency in terms of risk absorption capacity The profitability of SCBs had also improved during the year The gross and net NPAs of NBFCs stood at 64 per cent and 32 per cent as on March 31 2020 as against 61 per cent and 33 per cent as on March 31 2019 Their CRAR declined marginally from 201 per cent to 196 per cent during 201920 Supervisory and Regulatory Initiatives 8 An important objective of the Reserve Banks supervisory initiative has been to put in place systems and structures to identify assess and proactively mitigate or manage the vulnerabilities amongst financial institutions During the last one year based on the assessment of events which had the potential to pose a threat to the financial stability the Reserve Bank has reorganised its regulatory and supervisory functions with an objective of establishing a holistic approach to regulation and supervision The unified approach is aimed at addressing the growing size complexities and interconnectedness amongst banks and NBFCs It is also aimed at effectively addressing potential systemic risks that could arise due to possible supervisory or regulatory arbitrage and information asymmetry Further a calibrated approach has been designed to provide the required modularity and scalability to the supervision function to ensure a better focus on the risky institutions and practices to deploy appropriate range of tools and technology to achieve the supervisory objectives and to enhance capability to conduct horizontal or thematic studies across supervised entities on identified areas of concern As a fulcrum of the calibrated supervisory approach the Reserve Bank has strengthened its offsite surveillance mechanism to identity emerging risks and assess the vulnerabilities across the supervised entities for timely action We are also working towards strengthening the supervisory market intelligence capabilities with the help of both personal and technological intelligence 9 Specialised handling of weak institutions at the Reserve Bank now helps in closer monitoring and successful resolution of such entities in a nondisruptive manner The timely and successful resolution of Yes Bank is an example After exhausting all possible options and with a view to safeguard the interest of the depositors and ensure stability of financial system we decided to intervene at an appropriate time when the net worth of the bank was still positive The Yes Bank reconstruction scheme forged a unique publicprivate partnership between leading financial entities of India and it was implemented in a very quick time which helped the banks revival successfully safeguarded the interest of the banks depositors and ensured financial stability I wish to compliment the State Bank of India for providing leadership to this initiative With regard to the Punjab Maharashtra Cooperative Bank the Reserve Bank is engaged with all stakeholders to find out a workable solution as losses are very high eroding deposits by more than 50 per cent 10 For NBFCs active engagement with stakeholders was useful to identify emerging risks and take prompt action Considering their increasing size and interconnectedness the Reserve Bank has taken steps to strengthen the risk management and liquidity management framework of NBFCs As you may be aware NBFCs with a size of more than 5000 crore have been advised to appoint a functionally independent Chief Risk Officer CRO with clearly specified role and responsibilities Also governmentowned NBFCs have been brought under the Reserve Banks onsite inspection framework and offsite surveillance The amendment to the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 effective from August 1 2019 has strengthened the ability of Reserve Bank to better regulate and supervise the NBFCs Besides some large NBFCs and NBFCs with certain weaknesses are monitored closely on an ongoing basis 11 In case of the Urban Cooperative Banks UCBs special efforts are being made to move towards a riskbased and proactive supervisory approach to identify weaknesses in their operations early An early warning system with a stresstesting framework has been formed for timely recognition of weak banks for appropriate action Formation of an umbrella organization has been approved to provide liquidity capital IT and capacity building support to UCBs The exposure limits of the UCBs have been brought down to reduce credit concentration and the priority sector targets have been revised substantially upwards so that UCBs remain focused on their core segment ie micro and small borrowers The recent amendments in the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934 and the Banking Regulation Act 1949 will facilitate our supervision processes with respect to NBFCs and UCBs respectively Response to the Pandemic 12 As a part of response to the pandemic the RBI has undertaken a series of measures which are already in the public domain Besides the Reserve Banks focus was also to ensure that the contingency response to COVID19 was implemented by all regulated entities swiftly to minimise disruptions Accordingly right from the onset of the crisis the policy measures were aimed at operational issues and in particular ensuring business continuity and unhindered operations of the financial market infrastructure The Reserve Bank activated an elaborate business continuity plan for its own operations as well as ensured that banks also activate their own business continuity plans We advised all banks on 16th March 2020 to take stock of critical processes and revisit their Business Continuity Plan BCP All entities were also advised to assess the impact of COVID19 on their balance sheet asset quality and liquidity and take immediate contingency measures to manage their risks 13 As the lockdown has obstructed our onsite supervisory examination to an extent we are further enhancing our offsite surveillance mechanism The objective of the offsite surveillance system would be to smell the distress if any and be able to initiate preemptive actions This requires use of market intelligence inputs and ongoing engagements with financial institutions on potential vulnerabilities The offsite assessment framework which takes into account macro and micro variables is more analytical and forward looking and aimed at identifying vulnerable sectors borrowers as well as supervised entities 14 While the multipronged approach adopted by the Reserve Bank has provided a cushion from the immediate impact of the pandemic on banks the mediumterm outlook is uncertain and depends on the COVID19 curve Policy action for the mediumterm would require a careful assessment of how the crisis unfolds Building buffers and raising capital will be crucial not only to ensure credit flow but also to build resilience in the financial system We have recently 19th June and 1st July 2020 advised all banks nondeposit taking NBFCs with an asset size of 5000 crore and all deposittaking NBFCs to assess the impact of COVID19 on their balance sheet asset quality liquidity profitability and capital adequacy for the financial year 202021 Based on the outcome of such stress testing banks and nonbanking financial companies have been advised to work out possible mitigating measures including capital planning capital raising and contingency liquidity planning among others The idea is to ensure continued credit supply to different sectors of the economy and maintain financial stability III Major Challenges 15 Going forward there are certain stress points in the financial system which would require constant regulatory and policy attention to mitigate the risks The economic impact of the pandemic due to lockdown and anticipated post lockdown compression in economic growth may result in higher nonperforming assets and capital erosion of banks A recapitalisation plan for PSBs and private banks PVBs has therefore become necessary While the NBFC sector as a whole may still look resilient the redemption pressure on NBFCs and mutual funds need close monitoring Mutual funds have emerged as major investors in market instruments issued by NBFCs which is why the development of an adverse feedback loop and the associated systemic risk warrants timely and targeted policy interventions Increasing share of bank lending to NBFCs and the continuing crunch in marketbased financing faced by the NBFCs and Housing Finance Companies HFCs also need to be watched carefully 16 The global financial crisis of 200809 and the COVID19 pandemic have dispelled the notion that tail risks to the financial system will materialise only rarely The probability distribution of risk events has much fatter tails than we think Shocks to the financial system dubbed as once in a lifetime events seem to be more frequent than even once in a decade Accordingly the minimum capital requirements of banks which are calibrated based on historical loss events may no longer be considered sufficient enough to absorb the losses Meeting the minimum capital requirement is necessary but not a sufficient condition for financial stability Hence it is imperative that the approach to risk management in banks should be in tune with the realisation of more frequent varied and bigger risk events than in the past Banks have to remember the old saying that care and diligence bring luck To paraphrase Oscar Wilde being caught unprepared in the face of a shock may be regarded as a misfortune but to be caught unawares more than once may be a sign of carelessness2 17 Notwithstanding the numerous steps already taken there is always room for improvement to address several issues that may emerge in the medium to longterm These issues are as common to NBFCs and other financial intermediaries as they are to banks The supervisory approach of the Reserve Bank is to further strengthen its focus on developing financial institutions ability to identify measure and mitigate the risks The new supervisory approach will be twopronged first strengthening the internal defenses of the supervised entities and second greater focus on identifying the early warning signals and initiate corrective action 18 To strengthen the internal defenses higher emphasis is now being given on causes of weaknesses than on symptoms The symptoms of weak banks are usually poor asset quality lack of profitability loss of capital excessive leverage excessive risk exposure poor conduct and liquidity concerns These different symptoms often emerge together The causes of weak financial institutions can usually be traced to one or more of the following conditions inappropriate business model given the business environment poor or inappropriate governance and assurance functions poor decision making by senior management and misalignment of internal incentive structures with external stakeholder interests3 19 We are placing special emphasis on the assessment of business model governance and assurance functions compliance risk management and internal audit functions as these have been the areas of heightened supervisory concern Supervised entities generally tend to focus more on business aspects even to the detriment of governance aspects and assurance functions There was also an apparent disconnect between their articulated business strategy and actual business operations The thrust of the approach therefore is to improve the risk compliance and governance culture amongst the financial institutions In this regard the Reserve Bank has released a discussion paper on Governance in Commercial Banks in India with the objective to align the current regulatory framework with global best practices while being mindful of the context of the domestic financial system The main emphasis of the discussion paper is to encourage separation of ownership from management while owners focus on the return on their investment the management should focus on protecting the interest of all stakeholders The Board on its part should set the culture and values of the organization recognise and manage conflicts of interest set the appetite for risk and manage risks within that appetite exercise oversight of senior management and empower the oversight and assurance functions through various interventions The Reserve Bank will extend these principles of good governance to largesized NBFCs in due course IV The Way Forward 20 Despite the substantial impact of pandemic in our daily lives the financial system of the country including all the payment systems and financial markets are functioning without any hindrance The Indian economy has started showing signs of getting back to normalcy in response to the staggered easing of restrictions It is however still uncertain when supply chains will be restored fully how long will it take for demand conditions to normalise and what kind of durable effects the pandemic will leave behind on our potential growth Targeted and comprehensive reform measures already announced by the Government should help in supporting the countrys potential growth Possibly in a vastly different postCOVID global environment reallocation of factors of productions within the economy and innovative ways of expanding economic activity could lead to some rebalancing and emergence of new growth drivers The policy measures ie monetary fiscal regulatory and structural reforms provide the enabling conditions for a speedier recovery in economy activity while minimising nearterm disruptions 21 The need of the hour is to restore confidence preserve financial stability revive growth and recover stronger At the central bank we strive to maintain the balance between preserving financial stability maintaining banking system soundness and sustaining economic activity Post containment of COVID19 a very careful trajectory has to be followed in orderly unwinding of countercyclical regulatory measures and the financial sector should return to normal functioning without relying on the regulatory relaxations as the new norm The Reserve Bank is making continuous assessment of the changing trajectory of financial stability risks and upgrading its own supervisory framework to ensure that financial stability is preserved Banks and financial intermediaries have to be ever vigilant and substantially upgrade their capabilities with respect to governance assurance functions and risk culture 22 It is true that the pandemic poses a challenge of epic proportions however human grit manifesting through collective efforts intelligent choices and innovation will tremendously help us to come out of the present crisis Mahatma Gandhi had said the future depends on what you do today I have presented a birds eye view of the resolutions that the Reserve Bank has taken currently to combat this unprecedented situation I am confident that these will complement the measures undertaken by the Government in achieving our policy objectives Along with the tireless efforts of thousands of people and the undying spirit of our populace I am optimistic that these policy actions will yield desired results These trying times will only strengthen worlds faith in the resilience of our economy We shall prove this together Thank you 1Walter

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1383&fn=2765,Date FinTech and the Changing Financial Landscape,It gives me great pleasure to be here at the 4th edition of the Global FinTech Festival GFF I compliment the organisers for bringing all stakeholders of the FinTech ecosystem together for this threeday event with the aim of achieving a common goal of inclusive resilient and sustainable financial system It would be obvious to state that innovation is the bedrock of the FinTech industry Events such as these festivals enable sharing of knowledge and experience with peers both domestic and global which facilitate more innovation By bringing regulators and FinTechs on the same forum the festival also facilitates an understanding of regulatory expectations by the industry on the one hand and appreciation of industry developments and expectations by the regulators on the other Such thematic events provide the right kind of platform for nurturing a more vibrant FinTech ecosystem 2 In my address today I propose to touch upon changes in the financial landscape with the advent of FinTechs with particular emphasis on the role of Digital Public Infrastructure and role of the Reserve Bank in fostering innovation 3 The landscape of traditional financial services has undergone a profound shift with the advent of FinTechs This transformation has significantly impacted delivery of financial services by making them faster cheaper efficient and more accessible The global FinTech sector which currently generates 245 billion annual revenue a mere 2 share of global financial services revenue is estimated to reach 15 trillion annual revenue by 20301 The Indian FinTech industry is projected to generate around 200 billion in revenue by the year 20302 This projection indicates that by 2030 Indias FinTech sector could potentially contribute to approximately 13 of the global FinTech industrys total revenue These projections underscore the increasing significance of the Indian Fintech sector 4 Technological innovations by FinTechs are the result of interplay between the underlying i digital public infrastructure ii institutional arrangements and iii policy initiatives These key elements help foster a conducive environment for nurturing creative ideas and promoting transformative technologies which lead to beneficial and impactful changes in the financial industry Let me elaborate on these three aspects A Digital Public Infrastructure 5 Digital Public Infrastructure DPI is commonly recognized as a technology system that promotes interoperability openness and inclusion to deliver vital public and private services The defining feature of the Indian model of digitisation is the lead taken by the Government and the Public Sector in building an infrastructure on top of which innovative products are created by private sector FinTech firms and startups In fact India has pioneered a layered approach to DPI with the concept of the India Stack In this respect the impact of JAM trinity ie Jan Dhan Yojana Aadhar and Mobile in terms of financial inclusion digitisation of financial services and emergence of FinTech ecosystem has been significant i Jan Dhan YojanaBank accounts 6 As per the World Banks Global Findex Database 2021 76 of adults worldwide had access to an account in a bank or a regulated financial institution as compared to 51 in 2011 In comparison the percentage of adults in India who had access to bank account increased from 35 in 2011 to 78 in 2021 As you would be aware the Jan Dhan scheme launched by the government in 2014 for universalisation of bank account has played a significant role in achieving this remarkable progress So far over 500 million Jan Dhan bank accounts have been opened in India3 ii Aadhar Digital identity 7 Aadhaar Indias biometric identity system provides a single and portable proof of identity As on 30th November 2022 Unique Identification Authority of India had issued 135 billion Aadhaar identities4 The unique Aadhar identification number allows individuals to verify their identity through authentication regardless of their location thereby ensuring convenient access to financial services targeted financial subsidies benefits and other services nationwide This has also enabled FinTechs to offer paperless and contactless financial services Aadhaar has enhanced customer convenience strengthened the security of financial transactions and substantially mitigated the risk of identity fraud It is a good example of how digital public infrastructure can be leveraged for achieving public policy objectives iii Mobile Connectivity 8 The spread of mobile connectivity has also played a major role in the digitization of financial services in India The number of internet users through mobile phone in India has grown from about 70 million in 20145 to about 800 million in 20226 During the same period the number of digital transactions in India grew from about 12 billion in 20147 to about 91 billion in 20228 Increasing affordability of mobile phones cheap access to data and the expansion of mobile network coverage have spurred the growth in adoption of mobile wallets UPI and other digital payment methods iv Unified Payments Interface UPI 9 The UPI has played a phenomenal role in the FinTech revolution in India Its success story has in fact become an international model Its ability to instantly transfer money between bank accounts through mobile applications has transformed the way people make digital transactions The interoperability of UPI across banks has created a unified payment ecosystem Its userfriendly interface and QR codebased payments have made it very popular It has facilitated digital payments for small businesses and street vendors leading to greater financial inclusion 10 UPI has also spurred innovation in the FinTech space leading to the growth and development of other payment systems For instance the volume of transactions through Bharat Bill Payment SystemBBPS increased phenomenally after UPIbased platforms started providing such facilities Prepaid Payment Instruments mobile wallets have also witnessed higher volumes when mobile wallets were made interoperable through UPI The success of UPI is reflected in the sheer numbers as it has scaled up in relatively a short period of time More than 10 billion transactions for over Rs15 trillion value were carried out in August 2023 This number is steadily rising9 Indias technology stack has accelerated digitalisation10 through mobile phones and internet identity system data sharing rails AA framework11 payment rails and universalisation of bank accounts B Institutional arrangements 11 Institutional arrangements are also critical for the development of a financial system They undertake various functions such as research innovation training advancing technology solutions and developing best practices in finance They also promote stability transparency and fair practices in the financial sector The Reserve Banks initiatives in institution building for the FinTech sector include i establishment of the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology IDRBT12 which has been playing a crucial role in shaping the digital transformation of the Indian banking industry ii creation of the National Payment Corporation of India Ltd NPCI13 which has emerged as a pivotal organization driving the transformation of retail digital payments in India iii setting up of the Indian Financial Technology Allied Service IFTAS14 an institution to design deploy provide essential ITrelated services as required by the RBI banks and financial institutions iv setting up of the Reserve Bank Information Technology Pvt Ltd ReBIT15 in 2016 to strengthen cyber resilience of the Reserve Bank and that of the banking sector v formation of the FinTech department in RBI in 2022 and vi establishment of the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub RBIH to promote innovation in financial services C Policy Initiatives 12 Timely and appropriate policy initiatives play a crucial role in shaping the development of the FinTech sector The focus of our policy initiatives is to promote a conducive environment for innovation and also ensure the security and stability of financial services We have taken many such policy initiatives in the recent times They include issuance of regulatory guidelines for emerging areas such as payments banks 2014 account aggregators AA 2016 prepaid instruments 2017 peertopeer P2P lending 2017 invoice discounting Trade Receivable and Discounting SystemTReDS 2018 and Digital Lending Guidelines 2022 2023 Incidentally the cumulative number of consentbased information sharing through Account Aggregators has reached 1565 million in July 2023 With entities from Insurance Capital markets and Pension Funds joining the AA framework it is receiving a lot of traction 13 The Regulatory Sandbox framework was announced in August 2019 with a view to foster responsible innovation and promote efficiencies in financial services The four cohorts on retail payments cross border payments MSME lending and prevention of financial frauds together with the neutral fifth cohort reflect our commitment to promote innovation in the FinTech space Drawing upon the learnings from the first cohort of Regulatory Sandbox RBI has put in place a Framework for facilitating Small Value Digital Payments in Offline Mode which should give a push to digital transactions in areas with poor or weak internet or telecom connectivity 14 Further RBI is now conducting hackathons to promote innovation Our first hackathon HaRBInger was conducted in 2021 under the broad theme Smarter Digital Payments The second edition of our global hackathon HARBINGER 2023 has also been launched with the theme Inclusive Digital Services D Current Initiatives 15 Let me now turn to some of the recent techbased initiatives taken by the RBI which promise to be transformational i Central Bank Digital Currency CBDC 16 CBDC provides unique opportunities as it represents the next milestone in the evolution of the payment system As you would be aware RBI has commenced pilot runs of Indias CBDC eRupee for specific use cases in both wholesale and retail segments The CBDCWholesale Pilot was launched on November 1 2022 to settle secondary market transactions in government securities We are planning to test some more use cases going forward 17 The CBDCRetail Pilot was launched on December 1 2022 and covers both Person to Person P2P and Person to Merchant P2M transactions The pilot is testing the robustness of the entire process of digital rupee creation distribution and retail usage in real time The pilot is currently being operated through 13 banks across 26 cities Around 146 million users and 031 million merchants are currently part of the pilot as on August 31 2023 18 Needless to say as the next generation currency system CBDC needs to be introduced in a nondisruptive manner Therefore we are following a strategy of calibrated and phased implementation Recently we have enabled full interoperability of CBDC with UPI QR codes and are targeting one million CBDC transactions per day by December 2023 This will give us enough data points to study various design choices use cases and also behavioural pattern ii Public Tech Platform for frictionless credit 19 In the last GFF in September 2022 I had mentioned about the commencement of pilots on endtoend digitalisation of small ticket agricultural loans known as Kisan Credit Card KCC loans in a few states and our effort to develop a platform to provide frictionless credit for all segments of loans 20 The pilot on KCC digitalisation was launched in September 2022 in select districts of Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu The pilot enabled successful disbursal of agricultural loans up to 16 lakh not requiring any collateral per borrower within a few minutes to farmers by integrating with the digitised state land records database Credit Information Companies CICs satellite data Aadhar eKYC etc Farmers can apply for new KCC loans as well as KCC loan renewal directly from their location or from anywhere on smartphonestablets directly or through assisted mode The KCC pilot has been subsequently extended to select districts of Uttar Pradesh Karnataka and Maharashtra A total of seven banks are now part of Digital KCC Pilot The pilot has also been extended to dairy farmers in Gujarat The eligibility and scale of finance for such diary loans is instantly decided based on milk pouring data available with the milk cooperatives 21 We are now moving beyond digital KCC loans Let me elaborate Currently data required for credit appraisal exists in separate systems of different entities like Central and State Governments technology and FinTech companies banks service providers like Credit Information Companies digital identity authorities etc Accessing customer data available with multiple data sources is a challenge for banks as it would require multiple integrations with each information provider It is a challenge for the borrower also To enable frictionless credit in August 2023 RBI announced the launch of a digital Public Tech Platform conceptualised and developed in association with the RBIH The platform enables seamless flow of digital information from all the above sources to lenders obviating the need for multiple integrations 22 The Pilot project on the Platform was launched on August 17 2023 To begin with the platform will focus on products like MSME loans without collateral personal loans and home loans Based on the learnings the scope and coverage would be expanded to include more products information providers and lenders during the pilot E Customer Centricity Governance and Selfregulation 23 I would now like to touch upon certain key issues which are critical for the FinTech ecosystem to be stable and future ready In this context three critical issues viz customer centricity governance and selfregulation merit attention In the dynamic and everevolving world of business it is easy to get caught up in the pursuit of revenue bottom lines and the relentless drive for valuations Sometimes it is forgotten that the success of any enterprise is intricately tied to the satisfaction and trust of its customers This is the first critical issue I wish to highlight We must remember what Steve Jobs once said you have got to start with the customer experience and work backward to the technology16 24 To focus on customers means embracing a customercentric approach to innovation by understanding the needs of customers making provisions that protect customer interests and earn their trust This calls for developing an organisational culture in which continuous feedback mechanisms are embedded in the business strategy Designing solutions that safely and efficiently meet customer needs would not only elicit trust of customers it would also meet business objectives in a sustainable manner This can be achieved through simplified user interfaces and quick customer grievance redress mechanisms Avoiding customer harassment is essential to achieving longterm customer trust 25 In this context I would like to further add that digital innovations at times have also led to cyberrisk and data security related issues Illustratively mushrooming of illegal loan apps many of which had their origin in foreign jurisdictions have led to serious concerns about breach of data privacy unethical business conduct levying of exorbitant interest rates and harsh recovery practices This highlights the urgent need to ensure that innovations are accompanied by prudential safeguards and responsible conduct It is also imperative that regulated entities operate within the perimeter set by the licensing conditions and only undertake activities which are permitted under the regulations 26 The second critical aspect is the important role of governance in FinTechs By providing clear governance structures FinTechs can demonstrate their commitment to transparency accountability and responsible decisionmaking In fact effective governance in FinTechs require a collaborative effort involving regulators industry associations and the FinTech community itself Regulators play a critical role in addressing arbitrage ensuring compliance with existing laws and adapting regulations to technological advancements Industry associations can facilitate development of best practices The most critical role however has to be played by FinTechs themselves They must proactively adopt high standards of governance A robust governance structure encompasses clear delineation of roles and responsibilities transparent decisionmaking processes accountability mechanisms and stakeholder engagement Good governance must focus on ensuing effective oversight ethical conduct and risk management Ultimately it is good governance which would be key to durable and long term success of FinTechs 27 The third critical issue I would like to highlight is the need to establish an effective selfregulatory structure by the FinTech players themselves They need to evolve industry best practices privacy and data protection norms in sync with the laws of the land set standards to avoid misselling promote ethical business practices transparency of pricing etc I would like to use this opportunity to urge and encourage the FinTechs to establish a SelfRegulatory Organization SRO themselves Conclusion 28 Technological innovation has unprecedented potential to make finance more inclusive competitive and robust It is crucial that technological advancements in the world of FinTech evolve in a responsible manner and are truly beneficial to the people at large It is therefore vital for these innovations to be scalable and interoperable FinTech players should themselves ensure responsible digital innovations The Reserve Bank on its part will continue to drive the necessary regulatory and other policy measures to promote a vibrant and responsive FinTech ecosystem 29 The Indian economy is growing rapidly and with it the demand for financial services The coming years hold immense promise and innovators across the world should explore these opportunities I firmly believe that the GFF will emerge as a key global platform to unlock the full potential of Indias FinTech ecosystem My best wishes to you all for the success of this Global Fintech Festival 1

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1382&fn=2765,Date FinTech Innovation and approach to regulation,Mr Gopalakrishnan Mr Padmanabhan organisers of the Global Fintech Festival delegates from both India and abroad ladies and gentlemen I am delighted to be present in the fourth edition of the Global FinTech Festival GFF a platform which provides space for a meaningful interaction and sharing of ideas amongst stakeholders of the FinTech ecosystem The deliberations help all participants in identifying common objectives and also provide inputs for potential policy actions The elements of the theme of this years GFF viz inclusion resilience and sustainability succinctly capture the attributes of the sort of fintech ecosystem that one would like to see in India 2 The role of innovation in increasing the productive capacity of the economy is well understood But where does innovation itself come from Economists following the tradition of Joseph Schumpeter concluded that innovations are overwhelmingly the fruits of longterm investments that build on each other Innovation rarely occurs in isolation It is by its very nature deeply cumulative innovation today is often the result of preexisting ideas Innovation is also collective with long leadtimes what might appear as a radical discovery today is actually the fruit of years of hard work by different researchers2 In the Indian context the theory certainly holds true For example UPI which clocks more than 340 million transactions a day is the outcome of cumulative efforts and investments in institutions and technologies by the RBI and the government over the past decade and a half Indias fintech players and the traditional financial institutions have all seized the opportunities offered by these publicsector initiatives and created the thriving ecosystem that we see today 3 To be sure innovation in the finance space is not a recent phenomenon Wire transfers or ATMs are also instances of technological innovation as are modern stock exchanges with their anonymous order matching systems or algorithmic trading All these changes were gradual and enabled the financial system to adapt to the new technologies in a by and large a nondisruptive manner What is different about the recent financial innovations is the speed and scope of such changes making them potentially much more disruptive So much so that they merited the status of a separate industry and a new name Fintech It would be useful to remember that apart from the difference in speed and scope neither the older innovations nor the current fintech innovations change the basic nature and functions of the financial system 4 The major transformation that characterises the FinTech ecosystem is the increased efficiency with which financial products and services are delivered and consumed This efficiency is driven largely by a digitisation of information which can then be accessed processed and transmitted with ease b more direct interface between buyers and sellers between borrowers and lenders and between payers and receivers which optimises transaction chains and c democratisation of fast communication channels that expands the reach of the financial system Put together these efficiencies lead to lower cost quicker transactions and better inclusion This is clearly a desirable outcome and one that should be actively encouraged and promoted which is what the focus of policy making and regulation currently is But innovative developments raise different issues not undesirable in themselves but which need to be addressed nonetheless One issue is the relative roles of traditional financial institutions especially banks visvis the fintech entities Should their interaction be driven by motives of collaboration or competition The second issue is what should be the approach of financial regulators How is fintech ideally regulated same as traditional finance or differently I shall try and talk about these two issues briefly in what follows Collaborate or Compete 5 Traditional financial players let us use the term banks for simplicity have come to acknowledge the impact of FinTechs on their functional roles and they are reacting in one of two ways The first way is by internalising innovations thereby placing themselves in competition to fintech entities The second way is by collaborating with FinTechs either by engaging in onetoone partnerships or by purchasing the services of FinTech players The latter kind of collaboration can be functional in the sense that fintech entities can perform functions where they have the competitive advantage and banks focusing on areas of their expertise While customers benefit from an improved experience with curated products and services at competitive prices regulators also draw comfort in these arrangements as traditional financial entities like banks NBFCs which are well regulated and continue to discharge the primary responsibility of risk management through their balancesheets 6 Perhaps the sweet spot lies in fintechs acting as both competitors as well as collaborators The existence of competition is necessary to create incentives for fintechs to invest in innovations as well as pushing traditional entities to stay on their toes At the same time collaboration is essential for innovations to be absorbed into the financial systems Traditional players with their robust balance sheets capital base and risk management practices can provide the strength and stability while Fintechs with their agility and innovative capabilities can deliver on customer experience drive down costs and expand access What should be the areas of collaboration and what should be the fields of competition will eventually be determined by market forces But this is also an area that regulators need to focus on creating a regulatory framework that continues to spur innovation Regulatory perspective of FinTech Innovation 7 The Reserve Bank of India is deeply engaged in this process of technological transformation of the financial system Its role has largely been to create an enabling environment for innovation to thrive by creating mechanisms such as Regulatory Sandbox Hackathons creation of Fintech Department within the RBI and setting up of our own Reserve Bank Innovation Hub RBIH Recently we announced the development of a Public Tech Platform for Frictionless Credit The Platform is being developed by Reserve Bank Innovation Hub RBIH to enable delivery of frictionless credit by facilitating seamless flow of required digital information to lenders from multiple sources of information The platform will serve as a public good and exemplifies RBIs approach to fostering innovation This is the developmental role that RBI plays 8 At the same time RBI also plays the role of regulating the evolving financial system to maintain financial stability Rapid technology changes can outpace regulatory frameworks and raise issues about market integrity consumer protection data privacy and fair market practices The agility of new age fintech firms can challenge traditional regulatory models making it difficult to ensure compliance at all times and maintain stability The reliance on digital platforms also amplifies vulnerabilities to cyber threats and data breaches As FinTechs amass sensitive financial data ensuring robust cybersecurity measures and maintaining data privacy becomes paramount to safeguarding consumer information and financial systems The rush to roll out new products and services could potentially undermine market integrity and compromise customer protection Therefore while fintech innovation holds immense promise a balanced evolution where innovation is responsible and inclusive is essential for the sustained positive impact of Fintechs on financial services The regulations for P2P in 2017 the guidelines for Account Aggregator AA in 2016 are examples RBIs proactive developmental role The focus of the Digital Lending Guidelines DLG on fair treatment of customers demonstrate the prioritisation of innovation with suitable guardrails It is important to recognize that regulation plays a crucial role in managing the pace of change and allows the financial system to adapt to new innovations without threatening the stability of the system SelfRegulation 9 As regulators continue to contemplate implement and refine regulations for the orderly development of the FinTech sector selfregulatory organizations SROs could play a pivotal role in the fintech industry by promoting responsible practices and maintaining ethical standards These industryled bodies establish guidelines and codes of conduct that foster transparency fair competition and consumer protection SROs can facilitate collaboration between fintech firms regulators and stakeholders creating a framework for innovation with guardrails By proactively addressing issues like market integrity conduct data privacy cybersecurity and risk management SROs help build trust among consumers investors and regulators Their voluntary compliance mechanisms contribute to a more sustainable and reputable fintech ecosystem ensuring growth while minimizing potential risks and negative outcomes In the context of a new and evolving sector like FinTech it is the industry participants who possess the deepest understanding of the processes and practices within the trade Therefore they are bestsuited to establish common rules enforce them and effectively handle disputes that may arise from noncompliance with these rules Conclusion 10 In conclusion it is crucial for FinTechs to continue collaborating and innovating to enhance the effectiveness of the financial sector Collaborating and competing with FinTechs is essential for traditional financial entities too in order to adapt While innovation is vital it should also support social and economic goals Regulation should play the role of guiding the sector to those goals Selfregulation needs to play a far more active role too Together industry participants fintech and banks alike regulators and selfregulatory organizations can work harmoniously to shape a vibrant and resilient financial landscape that promotes inclusivity and progress for all Thank you for your attention and wish you all the best 1 Keynote address delivered by Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar at the Global Fintech Festival in Mumbai on September 5 2023 2 Chapter 7 Extracting Value Through the Innovation Economy in The Value of Everything by Mariana Mazzucato 2018
https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1380&fn=2765,Date Keynote Address by Shri Shaktikanta Das Governor RBI at the G20 TechSprint Finale organised by Reserve Bank of India and Bank for International Settlements BIS Mumbai September 4 2023,It gives me immense pleasure to be present here on the occasion of the G20 TechSprint 2023 Grand Finale an event that represents the spirit of innovation collaboration and transformation TechSprint is yet another initiative which reinforces our commitment to harness technology and foster innovations that can transform the financial landscape of the entire world As we gather here in the presence of remarkable minds and visionary leaders we stand on the vortex of possibility and progress where innovation is not just a concept but a catalyst for change 2 The G20 TechSprint is a global longform hackathon series that the BIS Innovation Hub cohosts annually with the G20 Presidency The objective of these hackathons is to identify new technologies which can address the challenges and priorities of central banks It provides a unique opportunity for publicprivate partnerships as well as regulatorinnovator partnerships These partnerships have great potential to contribute positively towards improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the financial services ecosystem 3 TechSprint 2023 resonates profoundly with Indias commitment to innovation With its robust startup ecosystem vibrant talent pool and unwavering commitment to digital transformation India is now focusing on the way technology can be harnessed to bridge gaps empower individuals and promote financial inclusion The past few years have seen a rapid expansion of digital technologies in India having transformative impact on our financial system Today more and more people have access to financial services regardless of their location or social status owing to the robust digital public infrastructure like Aadhar affordable internet and mobile phone services Innovations are powering the spread of mobile banking digital payments and other customised digital product offerings 4 A landmark example of our commitment to innovation is the Unified Payments Interface UPI which has been a gamechanger for Indias digital payments ecosystem It has helped to drive financial inclusion by bringing millions of unbanked individuals into the formal financial system With over 10 billion transactions a month the UPI has become the backbone of digital payments in India and has helped to catalyse a wave of innovations in the fintech sector Today there are more than 70 mobile apps and more than 50 million merchants who accept UPI payments 5 From financial inclusion through digital payments to using Artificial Intelligence AI for credit assessments Indias journey exemplifies innovation with a human touch At the Reserve Bank we are committed to promoting responsible innovation As part of this we have taken a few strategic steps in the recent past On the institutional front we have set up a FinTech Department in the Reserve Bank with the objective of paying dedicated attention to the fastevolving fintech sector The mandate of this department is to promote innovation while managing the associated risks if any Similarly we have set up the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub RBIH as a wholly owned subsidiary which is currently engaged in several innovative technology based projects touching people at the bottom of the pyramid Once fully scaled these projects are expected to have transformational impact on the financial services ecosystem particularly in the lending space The Reserve Bank has also put in place a Regulatory Sandbox framework wherein innovators get the opportunity to test their products in controlled environment The experience from the four cohorts under this sandbox so far has been encouraging In fact some of the products that successfully exited the sandbox environment have seen actual deployment Further with a view to generate ideas for a specific problem we have started conducting longform hackathons known as HARBINGER After successful completion of the first Harbinger in 2021 the second hackathon is currently in progress 6 More recently we have launched a pilot project on a Public Tech Platform for Frictionless Credit This platform was developed in association with the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub As you would be aware the data required for credit appraisal are available with different entities and they are in separate systems and these create frictions in timely delivery of loans to the needy Through this public endtoend digital platform we are enabling lenders to use the information available in multiple places for credit assessment and offer various lending products in a frictionless and speedy manner This platform would obviate the need for multiple bilateral integrations of lenders with information providers This endtoend digital platform is expected to bring in greater efficiency to the entire process of delivery of credit in terms of reduction of costs improving Turn Around Time greater scalability and further expanding the reach of financial services 7 Under Indias G20 presidency this fourth edition of G20 TechSprint was launched on May 4 2023 with the theme Technology solutions for crossborder payments The issue of cross border payments is a G20 priority area Notwithstanding the progress made so far the key challenges to existing cross border payments continue to be high cost low speed limited access and insufficient transparency Faster cheaper more transparent and more inclusive crossborder payment services would deliver widespread benefits to people and economies worldwide It would also support economic growth international trade and financial inclusion 8 Let me now move on to another technology innovation namely Central Bank Digital Currency CBDC Several central banks across the world are considering introduction of CBDCs and are taking steps in this direction India is one of the few countries which have launched CBDC pilots in both wholesale and retail segments Slowly and steadily we are expanding the pilot to more banks more cities more people and more use cases The empirical data that we are generating would go a long way in shaping the policies and future course of action With its instant settlement feature I believe CBDCs can play an important role in making crossborder payments cheaper faster and more secure 9 The problem statements identified for this G20 TechSprint 2023 have been carefully chosen These pertain to i reducing illicit finance risk ii forex and technology solutions for currency settlement and iii technology solutions for multilateral cross border CBDC platforms Let me highlight some important aspects of these problem statements 10 The first problem statement focuses on AMLCFT technology solutions that can be integrated into multilateral platforms to reduce the risks of illicit finance while increasing efficiency of the screening processes for AMLCFTSanctions Estimates from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime UNODC place global money laundering at 25 of global GDP which is about 800 billion to 2 trillion Other estimates place this closer to 3 trillion of which an estimated 3 billion per annum is successfully intercepted A very small percentage indeed of 01 It is extremely challenging to achieve full AMLCFT compliance as enforcement is difficult slow and at times only partial Therefore it is important to come up with innovative solutions to deal with this major risk to the international financial system 11 The second problem statement seeks to encourage the participants to come up with technology solutions in forex and liquidity to enable settlement in more number of emerging market and developing economy EMDE currencies The use of local currencies in crossborder payments can help to shield the EMDEs from global shocks protect against exchange rate fluctuations and encourage the development of local forex and capital markets Multilateral payment platforms that support multiple currencies would offer a way to promote such localcurrency payments As things stand today FX and liquidity risks associated with EMDE currencies can make the operation of multilateral platforms with EMDE currencies more challenging It is in this backdrop that effective liquidity mechanisms need to be developed 12 The third problem statement which was intentionally kept broad calls for technology solutions for multilateral crossborder CBDC platforms It invited solutions and technologies for multilateral crossborder CBDC platforms which can contribute to interoperability across multiCBDC platforms or domestic payment systems reduce operational cost and increase efficiency while ensuring consistency in standards across multiple jurisdictions I strongly believe crossborder payments can be made more efficient through adoption of CBDCs and this is an area which should receive close attention As all of us are starting on a clean slate on the CBDC front The adoption of right technology platform which is interoperable would be a great benefit to the future of crossborder payments ecosystem 13 I am happy to share that this G20 TechSprint 2023 has witnessed encouraging participation from around the world with 93 proposals submitted across the three problem statements In collaboration with the BIS 21 proposals in total 7 each for the three problem statements were shortlisted These proposals have the potential to bring transformation in the crossborder payments ecosystem in line with the G20 priority They have the power to provide solutions to maintain the integrity of the financial system empower the underserved reduce frictions in crossborder payments and amplify the resilience of financial systems These proposals were evaluated by an eminent jury and three best submissions one for each problem statement have been chosen as winners My congratulations to the winning teams I would also like to thank all the participants for their efforts and encourage them to continue their innovative endeavours I extend my gratitude to every participant mentor judge and partner who have contributed to the success of this edition of the G20 TechSprint I also acknowledge the active contribution of the BIS Innovation Hub in this entire journey Together we have demonstrated the power of collaboration and the promise of innovation 14 Let me now conclude by stating that innovation is at the heart of progress In an increasingly complex and interconnected world our economies markets and regulatory frameworks must evolve in tandem The Grand Finale of the G20 TechSprint is not just a celebration of technological advancement it is a testimony to our commitment to innovation as a driver of prosperity resilience and inclusion In our pursuit of innovation we must also recognise that technology is often accompanied by risks relating to market integrity conduct data privacy security and ethics Innovation must therefore be accompanied by a commitment to responsible innovationa pledge to balance progress with accountability disruption with safeguards and growth with ethics 15 This TechSprint has showcased that innovation is not confined to the walls of laboratories or the realm of academia It resides in the aspirations of people and nations As we get closer to the G20 Summit on 9th and 10th September let us renew our commitment to realise the G20 theme of One Future We must embrace the spirit of global cooperation to make the benefits of technological advancements and innovations available to all Thank you and wish everyone all the best
https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1375&fn=2765,Date RBI Fintech The Road Ahead,Good Morning to all I am delighted to be present here at the India Startup Conclave All of you represent the best of the Indian entrepreneurial spirit and it is my privilege to be addressing this gathering India is one of the fastest growing large economies today our population is young and adequately skilled the policy environment is supportive of private enterprise our capital markets are capable of funding good business ideas the India stackthe envy of the world all these factors have allowed many startups to bloom thereby creating a robust Indian startup ecosystem FinTech entities comprise a large part of this startup ecosystem 2 The emergence of FinTechs FinTechs are transforming financial services across sectors including credit payment systems wealth management investment advice insurance financial inclusion and even financial sector supervision The COVID19 pandemic has given a strong boost to digitisation the fusion of technology and finance played a crucial role by facilitating smooth loan disbursals robust 24x7 payment systems uninterrupted access to financial services and direct benefit transfers New and innovative technologies brought by FinTechs are helping in driving down cost refocussing products and services and improving customer reach and experience The ongoing developments innovations and emergence of new technologies will significantly shape the trends in the financial world of tomorrow As a principal regulator of the financial system and with a mandate for ensuring financial stability the RBI is closely watching the fast evolving world of FinTechs In fact to provide necessary support to the nascent sector more than a year ago we had set up a FinTech Department to give dedicated focus to this sector and to foster innovation I will take the opportunity today to share with you how we in the Reserve Bank view the changes in the financial services space caused by absorption of new and innovative technologies and the resulting issues like regulatory level playing field consumer protection innovation and central bank digital currencies CBDCs Regulation and Fintech 3 We believe that the fintech sector will play a crucial role in achieving objectives of greater financial inclusion cost and time efficiency and so we play the role of someone who encourages development of this sector One way of looking at fintech innovation is in terms of three variables Time Access and Data Many innovations in essence enable saving time that is transactions to be done with speed eg fast payment systems The second element of innovation is about access that is they take services to people who are not exposed to financial services promoting inclusion in both senses equity as well as formalisation of economic activity The third element of innovation is data using available data to create new processes and generating further data that can incentivise further innovation think of cashflow based lending or using tax data for credit assessment Increased penetration of internet processing speed and data availability has given a huge boost to financial innovation in the last decade or so These three elements are driving innovation in the Fintech space 4 While these innovations are paradigmatic changes financial products remain exactly what they are There are still deposits there is still credit or lending and there are still investments personal investments personal finances and so forth These financial products have been in existence for a very long time What has changed is the delivery of these products channels of delivery speed of delivery and price of these products We often hear that these changes are disruptive When we talk of disruption we are not talking of new products but basically talking of disruption of existing institutions and processes Conceptually therefore a Fintech entity providing characteristic banking services like loans or payments is pretty much doing a banking activity it just looks different Such entities may not require a banking license but they need to be regulated similar to how such activities are regulated for a bank 5 Financial services are among the most regulated industries if not the most regulated For good reasons as well they are key to growth and development they involve the use of public money and they are the conduit through which financial integrity is enforced Fintech firms should therefore be subject to similar regulatory oversight Regulation might lag in responding to the speed and complexity of changing processes Eventually however regulatory gaps will get filled and uniformity in regulation will be ensured Fintech firms would therefore be more stable as a long term business proposition if business strategies include regulatory compliance as a basic requirement Innovation should not be about exploiting regulatory arbitrage The usual complaint one hears for example when authorities globally are clamping down on cryptocurrencies that innovation is being stifled is not really valid 6 Undoubtedly we see a critical role for the fintech ecosystem to act as a force multiplier as we seek to achieve our goals of financial inclusion digitalisation and customer protection RBI has taken several steps to create a nurturing environment to foster innovation In 2016 we issued guidelines for Account Aggregators AAs recognizing their potential In 2017 regulations were established for PeertoPeer P2P lending even at a time when the sector was nascent in India The regulatory sandbox framework released by the Reserve Bank in August 2019 was intended for the purpose of fostering innovation The response to the regulatory sandbox has been encouraging to say the least An Interoperable Regulatory Sandbox IoRS to facilitate testing of hybrid products services falling within the regulatory ambit of more than one financial regulator is in place In November 2021 the Reserve Bank launched its first global hackathon HARBINGER with the theme Smarter Digital Payments The hackathon received encouraging response with 363 proposals submitted by teams from within India and from 22 other countries across the globe As a sequel we have also announced the second hackathon with the theme Inclusive Digital Services 7 In 2021 the Reserve Bank established its own Innovation Hub called the RBIH here in Bengaluru to support creation of an innovation ecosystem through collaboration among financial institutions the technology industry and academia RBI and the Innovation Hub have commenced pilots in the states of Madhya Pradesh Tamil Nadu UP and Maharashtra for fully digitalized Kisan Credit Card loan which is being disbursed in minutes Similarly pilot on fully digital dairy loan based on milk pouring data has commenced in Gujarat 8 RBI has launched the Rupee Central Bank Digital Currency CBDC pilot Currently 10 banks are participating in the wholesale pilot and 13 banks are part of the retail pilot Both the pilots have been going on successfully and we have been able to test various technical architecture design choices and use cases As on June 30th in the retail pilot we had crossed more than one million users and more than 262000 merchants The digital form of currency brings along the multiple possibilities which can bring innovation and efficiency such as features of offline programmability cross border transactions in current systems and may create altogether new frameworks for financial system to operate in I believe like in the case of UPI we will witness a lot of innovation on this tokenised form of money in the days to come 9 The RBI is mindful of the fact that innovation has potential to make finance more inclusive the financial system more competitive and healthier and regulation more effective and efficient While innovation is crucial it is necessary for these innovations to be responsible and even more beneficial if they address actual challenges faced by people in their day to day lives It is also important for these innovations to be scalable and interoperable allowing for expansion and providing advantages to a wider network of participants Bearing these principles in mind I would urge fintech players to contribute to development of the sustainability of the sector and ensure responsible digital innovations While focus on shortterm valuation gains may look attractive creating long term value should be the basic goal Fintech companies can prioritize several key areas like improving customer protection enhancing cybersecurity and resilience effectively managing financial integrity and robust data protection It is also essential for every player in the fintech industry to devote sufficient attention to governance business conduct compliance and risk mitigation frameworks as these aspects are vital for long term sustainability 10 I conclude by emphasizing that it is crucial for regulators the fintech industry and established institutions to engage in open and meaningful dialogue This dialogue is necessary to establish a shared understanding of fintech activities business models and the rationale behind regulatory measures Such collaboration among stakeholders will play a key role in ensuring effective regulation and fostering a conducive environment for FinTech innovation Thank you all for your attention and have a fruitful convention 1 Keynote address delivered by Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar at the

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1355&fn=2765,Date The FinTech Revolution in India Innovation Inclusion and Regulation,Shri Injeti Srinivas Chairperson IFSCA Shri B P Kanungo Director CAFRAL faculty members of IIM Ahmedabad and CAFRAL and distinguished participants of this conference a warm greeting to you all 1 I am delighted to be present here at this International Research Conference on FinTech The theme on Innovation Inclusion and Regulation in the context of the FinTech Revolution in India is indeed very topical and relevant to the times we live in 2 New technology often reinvigorates and reshapes economies In the last few decades or so information technologies perhaps had the most transformative effect on the economy and particularly in financial services The interlinkage of Finance and Information technology which is now known as FinTech has played significant role in the evolution of finance 3 Over the years technology has led to globalisation of financial services initiated a tectonic shift in the efficiency and speed of these services and increased convenience as well as better experience to consumers What makes the ongoing FinTech revolution different 4 The current FinTech revolution which started soon after the North Atlantic Financial Crisis of 200708 is unique in many ways This revolution is defined by the increased computing power use of new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning APIs that leverage Big Data in providing financial services Further there is an emergence of new entrants and new business models 5 Prior to current FinTech revolution digitalisation of financial services allowed banks and financial institutions to have structured data on their consumers which was used to have better understanding of the customers risk profile However with the emergence of Big Data analytics even better insights on customer preferences and behaviour can be obtained using alternate semistructured and unstructured data Moreover the analytics rather than being performed by the Financial Institution themselves is being outsourced to new age FinTechs In fact the financial sector is benefiting from this synergistic collaboration between the regulated entities and FinTechs with huge future potential Benefits from FinTech 6 Technology has reduced entry barriers and allowed FinTechs to enter the financial services More importantly it has allowed the unbundling of financial services in a manner that is economically viable even at a lower scale of operations In turn consumers have benefited by better customer experience and convenience Payment sector innovations in India is a typical example 7 One of the key value propositions that FinTechs offered was providing the same financial services as regulated entities but at a lower cost FinTech disruption in the Indian brokerage industry is a shining example of this 8 Large technology companies or Big Techs as they are popularly called such as Alphabet Meta Amazon etc have also expanded into financial services These companies leverage the data from their large existing user base coupled with network effects to provide contextualised or embedded financial products along with nonfinancial products In many jurisdictions in addition to payment systems Big Techs have successfully expanded into credit scoring and lending Risks from FinTech 9 Irrespective of the type of player undertaking financial business or the type of technology underlying it it is prone to a few fundamental sets of risks For regulated entities or new entrants depending on the business model they face legal reputational governance and operational risks in addition to the usual credit market and liquidity risks From customers perspective key risks include misselling discrimination data privacy and security From a regulators perspective there are risks associated with financial stability market integrity and customer protection 10 We monitor and calibrate our regulatory and supervisory response across these risk areas However new entrants and new technologies can further aggravate these risks For example FinTechs operating on lending side have spurred the availability of unsecured loans globally Such loans are often driven by machine learning models However effectiveness of these models for delinquency has not been fully established especially during an economic downturn Any significant failure of these models will not only be limited to new entrants but will also impact regulated entities with exposure to them 11 Use of models also brings the question of fair treatment in the extension of credit It is necessary that highly automated fintech business models for decision making take care of requirement of fairness through additional procedures controls and safeguards both in the development and deployment of models and also in the final decision making 12 Risk of unreliability or vulnerability of technology is not limited to FinTechs However since their business is heavily dependent upon automation their vulnerability is also greater 13 FinTechs need to be conscious of customer protection Missselling fraud or misconduct by FinTechs may harm the very consumers they intended to serve Careful management of this risk is significant for the sustainable development of the FinTech Sector A loss of consumer trust may put an unrepairable dent on the sectors growth story So while regulators are always worried about customer protection FinTechs should even be more aware vigilant and proactive in ensuring that the bedrock of their business remains protected Financial Inclusion 14 A financial sector that does not prioritise financial inclusion cannot distribute the benefits of economic growth to all levels of society2 Financial inclusion entails providing access to avenues of savings and investments and credit at an affordable cost It benefits the economy and society as it is accompanied by increased economic growth and reduction in inequality In countries that have large numbers of people who are unbanked financial innovation could help enhance financial inclusion especially if they are paired with digital identifications systems 15 With the use of alternative data endtoend digitalisation coupled with other technology interventions FinTech can bridge the credit gap that exists due to various reasons such as absence of credit scores cumbersome documentation manual processes etc 16 The Reserve Bank Innovation Hub RBIH in association with RBI is piloting an endtoend digitalisation of Kisan Credit Card KCC lending The project envisages automation of various processes within banks and integration of their systems with the service providers which will make granting of KCC loans more efficient and economical Regulatory approaches 17 Any approach to regulate the FinTech sector will invariably be informed by five fundamental objectives i financial stability ii consumer protection iii integrity of financial system iv competition and v orderly development of sector concerned 18 Under these overarching objectives there are various approaches to regulation At one end of the spectrum there is a handsoff approach that advocates allowing the sector to operate freely and develop without any regulatory intervention While this allows for harnessing benefits of innovation it risks the possibility of failing to protect the financial system and customers from adverse outcomes 19 At the other end of the spectrum there is the statusquo approach that aims to maintain the existing framework without any relaxation to cater for new developments Under this approach fintech product and services are regulated in the same way as the traditional financial product or service From the perspective of controlling risks it may appear to be the best approach as it applies tried and tested regulations However benefits of innovation may be lost 20 In India the RBI has endeavoured to find a middle ground trying to balance between the innovation brought by FinTech while addressing the unique risks they introduce 21 The NBFC Account Aggregator framework of 2016 NBFC Peer to Peer lending guidelines of 2017 and recent Digital Lending Guidelines are examples of adaptive regulation intended to address emerging risks 22 P2P regulations were introduced in the early stages allowing India to avoid failures witnessed in other jurisdiction while at the same time enabling an innovative mode of credit intermediation Similarly guidelines on Account Aggregator AA facilitate innovations related to open banking while building a robust data privacy regime Last years digital lending guidelines was a reiteration of two well established principles namely i lending business is regulated activity and ii onus of ensuring compliance in an outsourcing arrangement lies on the regulated entity 23 The RBI introduced the regulatory sandbox framework in 2019 for live testing of innovative products or services in a controlled environment The success stories emanating from the Regulatory Sandbox initiatives include the recently launched UPI123Pay which can enable more than 400 million feature phone mobile subscribers to make UPI payments even without an internet connection Further to extract the full benefit of regulatory sandbox a framework for Interoperable Regulatory Sandbox IoRS was also unveiled last year This framework is to facilitate testing of innovative productsservices falling within the regulatory ambit of more than one financial sector regulators 24 In 2022 as part of its efforts to promote innovation in the financial sector the RBI set up of the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub RBIH Within the RBI a new FinTech Department was established in 2022 to give focused attention to this evolving sector Its objective is to not only promote innovation in the sector but also identify the challenges and opportunities associated and address them in a timely manner 25 Within the regulatory envelope activitybased regulation as opposed to entitybased regulation is gaining traction Entitybased regulatory requirements are prudential conduct and governance related to the regulated entity rather than targeting at any activity On the other hand activitybased regulation focuses on the activity being undertaken attempting to apply uniform rules to the activity across all regulated entities For instance the recent review of the regulatory framework for microfinance loans attempts to provide a uniform regulation for such lending across banks and NBFCs by having a common definition of microfinance same business conduct and fair practice requirements etc FinTech Sector the way forward 26 India has the third largest FinTech ecosystem in the world While regulation can play a supporting role FinTechs themselves have to ensure the balance between innovation and risks arising therefrom Naturally the resilience of such an ecosystem will also inter alia depend on selfmonitoring of the conduct of the constituents Therefore from the FinTech sector perspective selfregulation can be a useful tool for setting and enforcing rules and standards 27 The sector should attempt to organise itself under a selfregulatory organisation which in turn can monitor the conduct of member FinTech entities This approach can also help in the objective of protecting the interest of customer and promoting high level of governance standard in FinTech entities Role of such an SRO can include setting the standards for conduct as well as acting as a bridge between the sector and regulators 28 Regulation is merely a guardrail to keep the sector on the right path However beyond its ability to innovate the development of this sector will largely depend on two critical elements These two elements are i Customer Centricity and ii Governance It is essential for the FinTechs to keep customers at the centre of their innovation and follow high standards of good governance as part of culture 29 While developing their products and process FinTech should ensure adherence to three basic principles from a customer protection perspective Firstly design robust customercentric products that avoid fintech induced losses to customers such as those from cybersecurity breaches technical glitches frauds etc Secondly ensure customer suitability and appropriateness Refrain from misselling or imprudent lending Thirdly ensure that any inherent biases in models are addressed in a fair manner 30 As far as governance is concerned the importance of adopting and adhering to good governance cannot be overemphasised Misgovernance is at the root cause of several failures For the sustainable development of the sector it is essential that FinTechs inculcate the values of accountability fairness transparency and independence The Board of Directors should be sufficiently empowered to assert its role as the balancer of conflicting interests of various stakeholders It should have adequate experience and independence Conclusion 31 In conclusion the FinTech revolution is well underway in India and it presents us with a unique opportunity to drive financial inclusion improve the efficiency of the financial sector and create new economic opportunities for millions of people The country has created a stack of open APIs and digital public goods which can be leveraged by the industry to innovate and promote financial and social inclusion 32 The Reserve Banks approach has been to balance innovation with regulation without compromising on the principles of prudence The FinTech Sector also needs to look into selfregulation and ensure that the issues relating to technology ethics customer protection and data privacy are addressed 33 India has assumed the presidency of G20 this year and the same gives the country an opportunity to showcase its leadership in the field of FinTech particularly in digital payment systems While India has made significant strides in developing its domestic payments systems which are acknowledged globally it can also contribute to innovations in crossborder payment systems In this context CBDC holds significant promise With India already piloting its CBDC it is well poised to steer the discussion on the need for crossborder interoperability of CBDCs and developing standards for effective interfacing so as to realise the potential of cheaper efficient and faster crossborder payments 34 I am quite hopeful that a number of papers in this conference will dwell deeper into the opportunities and issues surrounding innovation inclusion and regulation in the era of FinTech I look forward to fruitful discussions which will push the debate forward and also provide some enlightening policy insights I once again thank IIM Ahmedabad and CAFRAL for hosting this conference and giving me the opportunity to address it 1 Speech delivered by Shri M K Jain Deputy Governor Reserve Bank of India on March 10 2023 at the International Research Conference on FinTech Innovation Inclusion and Regulation jointly organized by the Indian Institute of Management IIM Ahmedabad and

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1346&fn=2765,Date Fintech Regulation,1 Yearends are usually a time for introspection and 2022 clearly offers a lot of food for thought On the bright side humanity seems to be finally putting the horrors of Covid behind it The rest of the story is not so bright The specter of war and geopolitical tension has reared its head again We were told in the late 1990s that business cycles were dead and inflation has been conquered After the financial crisis in advanced economies the focus shifted to deflation When 2021 was drawing to a close the consensus among policymakers was that rising prices was a transient episode That changed fast as inflation zoomed to multidecade highs and was back in contention as the primary macroeconomic problem to be fixed Rising interest rates volatile exchange rates led by a strong Dollar and the consequent rise in debt burden has turned the narrative on its head Inflation it would appear is giving a reality check to economists and policymakers alike 2 In the much narrower world of fintech with a much shorter history one story the story of cryptocurrencies runs in parallel We were closing 2021 with a narrative that TradFi Traditional Finance was slow inefficient and clumsy and DeFi Decentralised Finance and DAOs Decentralised Autonomous Organisations was the path forward riding on cryptocurrencies with their blockchain technology Crypto prices in their own jargon were mooning and investors were HODLing Since May 2022 cryptos have lost more than twothirds of their value and the ecosystem is unravelling The technology that was designed to herald the end of Governments and regulators and intermediaries is frantically seeking to be regulated Arthur Clarke the sciencefiction writer said any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic He would have perhaps used the word voodoo if he were to go by the promises peddled by crypto boosters 3 But cryptotechnology of which cryptocurrencies were but one use case is just one strand of the wider field of fintech Financial sector has been going through a process optimisation using technology throughout its history Over the course of the 1980s and 1990s banks in India have evolved through Advanced Ledger Positing Machines ALPM to Data Base Management Systems to Total Branch Automation and finally to Core Banking Solution CBS A logical extension of this journey as internet and mobile phone connectivity exploded were internet and mobile banking As of October 2022 there were approximately 33 crore active users of mobile banking services and approximately 75 crore active users of internet banking services The revolution in data storage and processing capabilities has enabled nonbanks to offer financial services such as peertopeer P2P lending crowdfunding alternative credit scoring open banking etc In the area of payments the transformation has been particularly striking with 247365 RTGSNEFT UPI digital prepaid instruments QR Scan Pay Bharat Bill Payment System BBPS AePS ushering in a new era of digital payments New information technologies like cloud computing APIs big data and AIML methods will ensure that FinTech would be the dominant theme in delivery of financial sevices in the future 4 Fintech is generally described as an industry that uses these technologies to make financial systems and the delivery of financial services more efficient The rise of fintech lending platforms open banking payment apps is a major source of disruption to the banking industry But these new business models and the transformation of existing businesses have brought new challenges for regulation Regulators need to ensure that nonbank entities lying outside the regulatory perimeter for banks do not undermine the role of banks raising financial stability concerns At the same time there is the need for these efficiencyinducing new technologies to be incentivised Clearly the entity based regulation of banks with its focus on health parameters like capital adequacy leverage liquidity or financial integrity requirements like KYC AMLCFT requires to be adapted to the presence of fintech entities that are not subject to the same regulatory requirements The concept of activity based regulation with the basic theme of same activity same regulation has gained currency The fundamental point is that any entity providing banking services needs to be subject to similar regulation as banks An arrangement where regulation of nonbank fintechs are not aligned to the regulation of banks or their subsidiaries offering similar services will create inefficiencies and risks associated to regulatory arbitrage Simultaneously new risks associated with use of information technology like cyber crimes and frauds also need to be addressed if the wider population is to be encouraged to adopt digitisation 5 How do we at RBI seek to address these challenges RBI plays a dual role as a developer of the financial system as well as a regulator Its regulation is premised on three principles First innovation is to be encouraged Second innovation should be assimilated in the financial system in a nondisruptive manner And third the course of digitisation should at every step ensure customer protection Encouraging Innovation 6 In the payment space RBI has played a role that is well recognised Introduction of RTGS NEFT CTS have been achieved with its own initiative Extending RTGS and NEFT to 24x7 has opened up scope for the growth and internationalisation of financial markets Setting up appropriate institutions has been another prescient move by RBI IDRBT set up in 1996 and focused exclusively on banking technology has led the initial stage of technology adoption in the banking system through the creation of INFINET National Financial Switch etc NPCI founded in 2008 has been the pioneer in digitisation of retail payments system in India with its UPI RuPay cards AePS BBPS and many other systems establishing India as the leading country in retail payment innovations RBI came up with the guidelines on Account Aggregator as early as in 2016 With the traction that this ecosystem is witnessing AAs are poised for bringing in the next set of innovation in the financial services segment P2P regulations came in 2017 when the sector was relatively at the nascent stage in India A Regulatory Sandbox framework was created in 2019 to incentivise adoption of innovative financial products or services in a controlled environment The Reserve Bank Innovation Hub RBIH was set up for collaborating with financial sector institutions technology industry and academic institutions for exchange of ideas and development of prototypes related to financial innovations RBI as well as the institutions it has created hold regular competitive events like the Hackathon to provide a channel for the fintech and startup sector to showcase innovations NonDisruptive Innovation 7 No regulator has the luxury of letting innovation disrupt the financial system in the hope that market might reach its own equilibrium eventually For instance we cannot afford to let loose DeFi technologies on the financial institutions with virtually no understanding of how a bankless system would operate Apart from the unacceptable financial stability risks this would amount to a regulator working towards its own irrelevance It is necessary that a regulator controls the manner and pace of absorption of new technology Allowing disruptive technology without clarity on whether the alternative is even feasible let alone desirable would be an unacceptable gamble A key element for smooth absorption of new technology is to ensure a level playing field If offering credit cards requires a banking or similar licence allowing a nonlicensed entity to offer them would amount to undermining the banking system as it would be placed at a competitive disadvantage Similarly digital payments are essentially a banking service in the sense that they involve movement of funds from one deposit account to another Deposit accounts are a necessity technology merely a tool deposit accounts can be used to make payments even without technology but not the other way round Facilitating a nonbank to use its technology to move bank deposits would amount to creating a competitive edge for the nonbank It may be argued that nonbanks could avoid use of bank deposits by maintaining deposit like funds say wallets Then nonbanks would be deposit taking entities that is they would be effectively banks which would require a banking licence A less disruptive and more efficient mechanism is to facilitate banks to collaborate or acquire the new technology Banks could also outsource or internalise the new technology Would it disincentivise innovation Not likely if the nonbank technology is appropriately priced 8 This brings us to the key issue of regulatory arbitrage If we want to avoid the inefficiencies caused by differential regulations for similar activities a nonbank undertaking banking functions needs to be licensed and regulated like a bank Without the license it should not be allowed to undertake banking activities This for example is what RBI did recently when it clarified that PPIs Prepaid Payment Instruments cannot be funded out of credit lines because it enabled an entity to undertake a licenced business without a licence That regulation clearly established the principle of same activity same regulation 9 More generally as long as innovations are compensated with appropriate market determined pricing maintaining consistency in regulation would encourage innovation and enable absorption of new technology nondisruptivly Customer Protection 10 Experience has taught us that market forces are unsuited to protect consumer interest in the absence of regulation Whether it is the derivatives market or the LIBOR setting unregulated markets eventually lead to outcomes that are inefficient for customers RBIs guidelines on storage of payments data are intended to secure users payment data RBIs warnings on cryptocurrencies and its public stance were guided as much by policy sovereignty as by the need to protect uninformed investors from being soaked RBI was perhaps the first central bank to openly call for complete prohibition of cryptocurrencies in India It is now recognized globally that a total ban is a valid policy option It is a distinct possibility that ambiguous or equivocal stance of regulators globally has contributed to the surge in demand and valuation in crypto products in recent years RBIs caution has perhaps contained the damage in India 11 In the payments space India is one of the few countries that protects users through twofactor authentication Although now it is recognised as an innovative regulation at the time RBI introduced it about a decade back there was a pushback and criticism Similarly the recent measures such as better customer control on card usage shorter TurnAroundTimes for transaction failures tokenisation are all initiatives intended to protect the customer 12 Regulation of digital lending apps is another example of regulations aimed at responsible practices and customer protection A key innovation for financial inclusion and providing credit to entities that lack access to the traditional financial system these apps nonetheless raised a host of business conduct issues such as unfair business practices opaque interest rates and unethical recovery practices As a percentage of overall loan portfolio of banks and NBFCs digital lending represents 0312 and 055 respectively in FY 2017 While still rather small their potential needs to be realised but in a responsible manner RBI had earlier in June 2020 advised banks and NBFCs to adhere to fair practices codes and outsourcing guidelines Given the emerging concerns comprehensive directions were issued in September 2022 These regulations specified the entities that were permitted to lend transparent loan and pricing norms and fairness in treating customers 13 In this context an unexpected regulatory challenge has been what one might characterize as complianceaversion Financial entities traditionally subject to regulation understand that regulation serves the larger objective of systemic stability and development Entities outside the financial space are still learning to adapt to a regulated environment Consequently their initial reaction to a regulation is objection Ironically enough the narrative created to justify such objection is usually customer inconvenience even by industry bodies The norms prescribed for recurring payments were criticised as inconvenient to customers until a survey3 revealed that more than 80 of customers welcomed the move Although to a lesser extent similar friction is occasionally exhibited even by regulated entities as can be seen in banks shunning of the FX Retail4 platform which would significantly improve the price for retail buyerssellers of forex RBIs approach to regulatory aversion is to patiently ease in regulations giving the ecosystem adequate time to adjust Global Coordination 14 A unique challenge for regulating fintechs is the need for global coordination Since these services are online and as in case of cryptocurrencies they span across national boundaries effective regulation would require global coordination Since technology by its very nature evolves faster than regulations regulators would usually be lagging behind A global common understanding of the risks involved and about the nature of regulation is necessary for it to be effective The issue is further complicated by differential impact of such technology for different countries For instance stablecoin would not pose as much of a threat to the country whose currency is used as a peg as it would to other countries Evolving common understanding on the risks posed by fast mutating technology is likely to remain a major challenge Internationalisation of Innovations 15 RBIs developmental role has prodded it to not only take many technology initiatives itself it has also started the process of extending the global reach of Indias premiere innovations Internationalisation of Indian Payment Systems is a policy objective of RBI After successful enablement of QR Code based payments through UPI at merchant locations in Singapore UAE and Bhutan RBI is collaborating with Monetary Authority of Singapore to enable crossborder person to person remittances in an instant and costeffective manner Additionally we have allowed to deploy a UPIlike system for Nepal Engagements are ongoing with multiple countries for UPI QR based payments person to person payments and developing UPI like systems 16 To provide a more efficient alternative to private cryptocurrencies RBI has embarked on the journey to introduce CBDC Digital Rupee It is expected to work as another efficient choice along with existing payment products Digital Rupee can facilitate transactions in locations with limited or no internet connectivity and therefore further financial inclusion Going forward it can be effectively used for delivery of Government subsidies and benefits using the feature of programmability which will lead to targeted or specified use of funds Among the various benefits of CBDC perhaps the most important is its potential to make crossborder payments faster and cheaper Here again a necessary precondition is that other countries develop their own CBDCs and there is a global understanding on the need to make CBDCs interoperable basically by linking the various CBDC systems and develop standards for effective interfacing Conclusion 17 Being a regulator as well as a central bank RBIs regulations focus on safeguarding national interests as well as being responsive to user needs In the area of Fintech creating an ecosystem to incentivise and harness innovation is a prime driver of our regulatory approach In this era of global financial markets and fintech revolution RBIs mandate is to protect sovereignty and serve public interest Our efforts are aimed at making regulation consultative and collaborative and maintain policy independence 1 Speech delivered by Shri T Rabi Sankar Deputy

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1327&fn=2765,Date Fintech as a Force Multiplier,I am delighted to be here today in the third edition of the Global Fintech Festival GFF I would like to congratulate the organisers the National Payments Corporation of India NPCI the Fintech Convergence Council FCC and the Payment Council of India PCI for organising this event The theme of the event Creating a sustainable financial world is very relevant in current times 2 In recent years India has witnessed rapid progress in the financial services sector Technology innovation and fintech are working in tandem and contributing to the dynamism of this sector In our journey towards higher levels of sustainable development and financial inclusion these forces have morphed into force multipliers We have leveraged a lot on these forces we need to leverage even more 3 Let me now get down to the specifics There has been exponential growth of technological enablers in India Telecom penetration availability of internet services adoption of technology in facilitating access to credit more efficient payment systems and deepening of financial inclusion have made significant progress and are continuing to progress further 4 The total number of broadband internet users in India stood at 807 crore at the end of July 20221 With more than 465 crore Jan Dhan accounts 134 crore Aadhaar enrolments and 120 crore Mobile connections new opportunities are opening up for implementing innovative ways of integrating and delivering services This can be gauged from the emergence of 100 unicorns in the country with record 44 unicorns established last year2 5 For any society aspiring to grow faster its financial institutions must be robust efficient and accessible The next decade of finance will be more focussed on two central themes i sustainable development and ii technology led innovations transforming the lives of common people Therefore sustainable development and ensuring a resilient financial system form the fulcrum for our policy architecture 6 As we have all witnessed technology has been central to the resilience in the face of the COVID19 pandemic particularly during the lockdowns imposed around the world It has also been central to our response to the crisis and in supporting the recovery Technology coupled with finance safeguarded the economies by ensuring seamless disbursal of loans robust 24x7 payment systems access to financial markets insurance MSME credit pension services and direct benefit transfers 7 As per the World Bank at least 58 governments in developing countries have used digital payments to deliver COVID19 relief3 The scale of operations in India in this regard was of course much larger compared to other countries The Global Findex Database 20214 reported a significant increase in financial inclusion around the world In developing countries 71 per cent of people have bank accounts up from 42 per cent a decade ago Approximately 40 per cent of people who made a digital payment from their account to a merchant or for a utility service did so for the very first time since the start of the pandemic 8 In India the pandemic accelerated the push towards digitalisation especially in the rural areas The period from March 2020 to August 2022 has seen a massive growth of 427 per cent in UPI transactions which reached a new high of 657 crore transactions in August 20225 alone The number of UPI QR code enabled payment acceptance points6 increased by about 9 crore 86 YoY to reach 20 crore as at end of July 2022 reflecting the growing acceptance and preference for contactless payments Innovations in our Financial Sector 9 The financial services industry in India has seen enormous transformation Products like internet and mobile banking electronic funds transfer UPI Aadhaar eKYC Bharat Bill Payment System BBPS QR Scan Pay digital prepaid instruments and similar other initiatives have transformed the traditional banking operations Banking hours have been transcended We now have digitalmobileanywhereanytime banking While several initiatives originated from the industry the government and the regulators have created an enabling ecosystem to promote the FinTech sector Initiatives like Startup India Digital India India Stack Account Aggregators Peer to Peer P2P lending platforms and 24x7 digital payment systems have proved to be key enablers The Fintech ecosystem in India has indeed evolved and is poised for a giant leap 10 Let me now touch upon some of the other initiatives taken by the RBI in this area The Regulatory Sandbox framework was released in August 2019 with a view to foster innovation With this the Reserve Bank entered the select group countries that have their very own regulatory sandbox ecosystem After four themebased cohorts on retail payments crossborder payments MSME lending and prevention of financial frauds a theme neutral fifth cohort was announced earlier this month It reflects our keen desire to increase the footprint of innovation in the FinTech space The success stories emanating from our Regulatory Sandbox initiative include among others the Framework for facilitating Small Value Digital Payments in Offline Mode and the recently launched UPI123Pay which was aimed at enhancing digital financial inclusion by enabling over 40 crore feature phone users to access the benefits of UPI in a safe and secure manner 11 The Reserve Bank for the first time organised a Global hackathon titled HaRBInger 2021 with a view to make retail payments more innovative This witnessed enthusiastic response We received 363 proposals including 22 from abroad from countries like the USA and the UK This exercise gave us a glimpse of the creative talent pool that India possesses and reinforced our belief that India is well positioned to provide leadership in the FinTech space I understand that the winners of HaRBInger 2021 are also participating in this Global Fintech Festival to further showcase their creativity and talent 12 More recently the RBI has set up the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub RBIH as a subsidiary in Bengaluru The Hub has an eminent Board of Directors drawn from the private sector and domain experts The RBIH is currently undertaking several important projects I am confident that going forward the RBIH will benchmark itself as a centre of excellence 13 We have also created a new FinTech Department in the RBI from January 2022 to give focused attention to this evolving and dynamic sector The objective of this department is not only to promote innovation but also identify the associated challenges and opportunities and address them in a timely manner All matters relating to facilitation of constructive innovations and incubations in the FinTech space with wider implications for the financial sector and markets are being dealt with by this department in addition to interregulatory issues and international cooperation 14 Further as you would be aware the RBI is now actively working towards a phased implementation of Central Bank Digital Currency CBDC in both wholesale and retail segments This is expected to give further fillip to the digital ecosystem FinTech the road ahead 15 It is well known that FinTechs contribute to enhance efficiency in terms of service delivery and in bringing down costs Through their customised products and customer interfaces they provide an enriching and seamless consumer experience They also have the potential to improve market access and a range of product offerings apart from improving access to credit and financial inclusion in the traditionally unserved or underserved segments 16 In India one of the most transformative roles that can be played by FinTech is in the area of credit delivery in partnership with traditional lenders especially in rural and semi urban areas Timely availability of credit at reasonable cost especially for agriculture and allied activities and MSMEs is very crucial for our economic growth 17 One of the key challenges currently associated with availment of such credit is that it is a largely paper based process with high Turn Around Time TAT Sometimes it requires multiple visits to bank branches and cumbersome documentation It entails high operational costs for lenders and opportunity cost for borrowers Considering these challenges and taking forward RBIs FinTech initiatives digitalisation of Agri Finance in India was ideated between the Reserve Bank and the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub The idea was to enable frictionless delivery of Kisan Credit Card KCC loans in a paperless and hasslefree manner and also reduce the turnaround time and avoid multiple visits to bank branches I am happy to state that the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub has designed an endtoend digital process for seamless and quick access to rural credit A pilot project based on this innovation has been launched in Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu in partnership with the Union Bank of India and the Federal Bank respectively for both new KCC loans and renewal of such loans up to a threshold 160 lakh per borrower Going forward based on the learnings from the pilot the digitalisation of KCC loans is proposed to be expanded to all districts of these two states as also to other states Eventually our desire is to develop and operationalise an integrated and standardised technological platform to facilitate frictionless credit to all segments of society for the whole country with special emphasis on rural and agricultural credit And if we can do this in the next one year it would be a major milestone in Indias growth story and journey towards India2047 18 Another example of techenabled regulatory innovation by the RBI is the Account Aggregator AA framework This is an important step towards realising the potential of empowering millions of underserved customers to digitally access and share their financial data across institutions in a secure and efficient manner The framework has been expanded to include institutions regulated by SEBI IRDAI and PFRDA This is a progressive step to help customers gain control over their financial data and use it for accessing a variety of products including credit insurance investments for their own benefit Centralised KYC CKYC and Video KYC are other enablers to facilitate seamless onboarding of customers in a digital and cost effective manner We are giving greater focus on these initiatives 19 The Reserve Bank is committed to take more such initiatives with the support of all stakeholders In this endeavour and in collaboration with the stakeholders three exciting new products are being launched later today Two of these pertain to enhancing the feature set of UPI by facilitating small value transactions through UPI Lite and linking credit cards to UPI The third initiative is the enablement of crossborder inward bill payments using Bharat Bill Payment System BBPS 20 The emergence of FinTech players and the growing popularity of their innovative products have challenged the existing players in financial services in maintaining their market share margins and customer base The incumbent firms are responding to these challenges by adopting various strategies which include making investments in FinTech companies and partnering with them They are also enhancing their inhouse capabilities to adapt to the new realities 21 A wave of changes brought in by FinTech have had a positive impact in terms of enhancing inclusion and further penetration of financial services At the same time these developments have also ushered in an era where enormous amount of consumer data is being generated and leveraged upon by a few entities the so called BigTechs by virtue of their huge customer base Such developments raise concerns on concentration risk and potential spillovers as their level of engagement with the financial system strengthens in the years to come Therefore potential risks to public policy objectives of maintaining competition market and business conduct operational resilience data privacy cyber security and financial stability need closer attention 22 As we have seen the way digital lending has taken off in the recent past was phenomenal While it has served the needs of various segments it has also raised several concerns which manifested itself through spate of complaints regarding usurious interest rates unethical recovery practices and data privacy issues The Reserve Bank has endeavoured to address these issues proactively and as early as in June 2020 regulatory guidance was provided to our Regulated Entities This guidance among other things mandated that digital lending platforms disclose the names of the banks NBFCs upfront on whose behalf they were providing credit The recently issued regulatory guidelines on digital lending7 strike a well considered balance between customer protection and business conduct on the one hand and supporting innovation on the other Let me emphasise that while innovations are very much welcome they must be responsible and should enhance the efficiency and resiliency of the financial system while benefitting the consumers Robust internal product and service assurance frameworks together with fair and transparent governance will go a long way to safeguard the interest of customers and ensure longterm sustainability of the FinTech entities themselves The level of duediligence and oversight exercised by the regulated entities on their outsourced activities needs to be strengthened further This would help in proactive mitigation of risks at the incipient stage itself 23 I would also like to flag certain material concerns regarding the unbridled mushrooming of digital lending apps The need of the hour is to ensure assurance of safety after following a process of greenlighting whitelisting and duediligence by the regulated entities The RBI in association with other relevant agencies is taking steps to address this issue and take further steps as may be necessary Governance and Conduct 24 As we continue to support technological advancement and innovation it is equally important that adequate attention is also placed on governance and conduct issues At the end of the day sustainability of any FinTech activity or business is about enhanced customer protection better cyber security and resilience managing financial integrity and strong data protection 25 I wish to assure the FinTech community that the RBI will continue to encourage and support innovation At the same time we would expect the ecosystem to pay attention to governance business conduct regulatory compliance and risk mitigation frameworks The fintech road ahead will witness ever growing traffic in addition to the large number of existing players who are already there It is therefore imperative that every player on this road follows the traffic rules for hisher own safety and the safety of others Conclusion 26 A sustainable financial world is not just for us it is also for the future generations It is up to us how we want to move forward in this journey The RBIs focus has always been on encouraging innovation by providing an enabling environment Simultaneously as guardian of financial stability the RBI also remains watchful of any undue risk build up and responds to them The Fintech players I am sure will join us in this endeavour 27 With the amazing talent base that we have in India and the giant leaps we have taken in the digital and FinTech space in recent years I am confident that India is well positioned to shape the future course in this area As we set sail for a brighter future I wish you all a safe and fulfilling journey ahead Thank you 1 Telecom Regulatory Authority

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1202&fn=2765,Date Inauguration of the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub RBIH,Central Banks are often viewed as traditional institutions that set monetary policies issue currencies and regulate and supervise the financial sector segments and entities For every economy to grow steadily and efficiently this characteristic of a central bank is very important Being a full service central bank the RBI also plays a developmental role and is looked upon as a residual regulator as well 2 RBI has been able to perform its varied roles with required professionalism and pragmatism The ability to combine traditional functions with innovation has been critical to ensure orderly growth of the financial sector To achieve specific end goals apart from its own initiatives the RBI has been an institution builder and has nurtured the setting up and development of many institutions1 like NABARD CCIL NPCI IDRBT IGIDR and ReBIT 3 The recent phenomenon of technological innovations transforming the experience of availing financial services be it banking nonbanking payment services or being part of the financial markets has raised greater expectations from RBI to act as an innovation enabler as well To promote and facilitate an environment that accelerates innovation across the financial sector the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub RBIH has been set up as a wholly owned subsidiary of the RBI Taking into consideration the availability of skilled personnel innovation ecosystem linkages with academia incubation centres etc it was decided to set up the Hub at Bengaluru Karnataka 4 This initiative puts RBI in an exclusive group of select global central banks that are enterprising enough to change the mode of engagement while dealing with innovation It also reflects a genuine commitment to have continuous engagement with industry innovators academia and related stakeholders to nurture and leverage beneficial innovation in the financial sector which can deliver customised products particularly relevant for those at the bottom of the pyramid I have no doubt that this transformative move will facilitate further innovation not just in the areas under the remit of RBI but across the entire spectrum of financial sector in the country 5 The RBIH is an investment for the future The Hub is expected to build an ecosystem for development of prototypes patents and proofs of concept and promote crossthinking spanning regulatory domains and national boundaries With its own independent Board comprising eminent members from industry and academia I am sure RBIH is perfectly positioned to facilitate convergence of ideas among various stakeholders While fostering innovation however the underlying focus of RBIH should always be to promote access to financial services and products for the lowincome population in the country It should be our duty to promote such innovation that not only improves process efficiencies but also transforms the society The overall focus I feel should be on innovation with a purpose 6 I am happy to hear that to begin with the Hub has plans of identifying and mentoring startups having maximum potential I wish and hope that the Hub strives to nurture multiple indigenous ideas in the short to medium term each of which can positively impact one or more segments of our financial ecosystem The Hub is also expected to collaborate with various Government Ministries Departments Academia to identify problem statements in different domains and explore potential solutions To become a Hub in true sense RBIH should serve as a focal point for interaction among various stakeholders It should become the epicentre for promotion and exchange of views and knowledgesharing while also remaining focused on delivering clear cut objectives within reasonable timelines 7 RBIH should aim to establish itself as a respected innovation and incubation centre and showcase Indias commitment to openness of ideas resolve to innovate with underlying concern for inclusive growth I am confident that RBIH shall facilitate making our financial sector more agile participative and robust 8 With these words I am delighted to inaugurate the RBIH and wish it all success The expectations are high and the Hub will be guided by public interest It has the potential to touch the lives of every citizen by facilitating innovations with high social impact The Hub I am sure will emerge as a significant player in Indias journey of inclusive growth 1 National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development NABARD The Clearing Corporation of India Limited CCIL National Payments Corporation of India NPCI Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology IDRBT Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research IGIDR Reserve Bank Information Technology Pvt Ltd ReBIT
https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1129&fn=2765,Date Responsible Digital Innovation,Good morning 1 Fintech or technology that provides digital financial services is transforming the provision and delivery of financial services At its most basic level digital technology enables speed speed in processing information and speed in communication Processing speed has reduced cost and time for transactions while communication speed has enhanced connectivity of systems expanding the reach of transactions Taken together digital technology is changing the way financial services are organised and financial products are delivered 2 Digital innovation has for example enabled fast payments systems like UPI and IMPS Instantaneous communication and the ability to process large databases has enabled use of Aadhar for transaction authentication which in turn has made it possible to effect large scale Government transfers instantaneously and directly into the bank accounts of beneficiaries eKYC has contributed to safety of online payments P2P Lending or Crowdfunding platforms are gaining popularity in substituting for bank credit Technology such as AIML has been used in such diverse areas as investment advice fraud detection HelpDesks etc High Frequency Trading has changed the way financial markets function 3 Notwithstanding these benefits it is important to appreciate the limitations of technology To understand this let us break down the essence of financial intermediation between savers in an economy basically households and borrowers The core part of this financial intermediation is done by banks through accepting deposits extending credit and enabling payments Since virtually all money other than currency is held as bank deposits banks are at the centre of the payments system This basic intermediation structure is overlaid by other institutions Financial markets enable direct transfer of funds from savers to borrowers bypassing banks to that extent Entities like insurance companies pension funds and asset management companies assume varied degrees of importance in financial markets as alternatives to intermediation by banks In all these cases funds eventually are held in a bank account 4 Now that we understand how banks intermediate funds we can identify the defining character of intermediation banks bridge gaps in space and time between savers and borrowers The spatial gap occurs when a saver and a borrower do not know each other or are in different locations The temporal gap occurs when the needs of the borrower and the lender arise at different points in time borrower needs money after a month but the saver has money now This later gap is bridged by banks through provision of liquidity services a bank would take a deposit from the saver now and lend to the borrower after one month Banks are uniquely placed to provide this service because they can create money and credit and thereby act as liquidity providers to the economy 5 Similarly in the field of payments the area in finance where fintech is the most impactful banks are uniquely placed since all digital payments transactions are transfer of money from one bank account to another All other payment service providers facilitate transfer of money from one bank account to another and in that sense play a supporting role 6 Now it is easier to see why financial technology while it can improve the efficiency of intermediation cannot replace the core nature of financial intermediation It can bridge the spatial gap but not the temporal gap in our terminology For instance one would still need a bank to warehouse the liquidity risk as no other entity can create credit and money Put another way any fintech entity that provides such liquidity services is effectively functioning as a bank and therefore should be subjected to the same legalregulatorysupervisory regime that a bank is subjected to This is one reason why in almost all countries entities other than banks are not allowed to directly deal in deposit or depositlike money 7 This understanding of the limitations of technology prepares us better to manage the change that fintech is causing in banking and finance It would also enable an effective approach to regulating fintech and the fastmutating financial system 8 The benefits of technology in improving efficiency and reach of the financial system as well as the concomitant benefits for economic growth and financial inclusion call for a systematic nondisruptive adoption and encouragement of such technology in the financial system Because FinTech can improve the efficiency of intermediation by driving down costs sachetising of products and services improving customer service and expanding the reach of financial services it poses a challenge to the incumbents and forces them to adapt or change the way financial intermediation takes place The ideal approach is for FinTech companies to be considered as enablers and partners by banks or other financial institutions Competition for banks comes not from FinTech firms but from other banks which leverage FinTech better Regulation of Fintech 9 As fintech is transforming the financial landscape the nature of regulation has to adjust The sheer diversity in the functions performed by fintech firms necessitates a widening of the regulatory perimeter The approach to regulation also needs to adapt to the type of entity being regulated While similar activities should attract uniform regulation in most cases such activity based regulation might be less effective than entitybased regulation when one is dealing with financial activities by bigtech firms Cybersecurity risks are likely to overshadow financial risks for all Systemic risks operational risks and risks affecting competition are of prime importance when dealing with large financial market infrastructure entities or bigtech Countries need to overcome the legislative and regulatory deficits in dealing with concerns surrounding privacy safety and monetisation of data Regulations pertaining to data issues needs to adapt to a world where boundaries between financial and nonfinancial firms is getting increasingly blurred or geographical boundaries are no longer a constraint BIS Papers No 117 33 10 It is virtually impossible for legislation to keep in step with the fast mutating fintech landscape Until legislation catches up regulation has to adapt to ensure that the financial system absorbs digital innovation in a nondisruptive manner Regulation is sometimes defined as the process of slowing down change to give time for a system to adapt and evolve The job of the regulator is not easy when a given financial service performed by wellregulated financial firms changes to include nonfinancial firms in a constantly reconfiguring financial value chain Similarly there are frictions for a nonfinancial firm to get used to financial regulation The social benefits of a new technology or its impact on customer needs to be well understood by all stakeholders regulators existing financial firms as well as innovating fintech entities Slowing down the process of change which attracts the criticism of stifling innovation is often the best way to ensure customer protection 11 As digitisation is promoted by public policy the industry is often characterized by the rise of dominating entities whether bigtech or infrastructural entities This raises competition and concentration risks There is no clear answer to how such issues are to be resolved limits on market share for example might open up the market to new players but it could also stifle incentives to innovators Regulators also need to improvise to address singlepointoffailure risks arising from market concentration as much as they need to be alert to new points of failure arising from shifting value chains The Indian Experience 12 The approach to regulation taken by the Reserve Bank has been to create the environment where digital innovation can thrive This involved to begin with taking the initiative to set up the basic infrastructural entities which provided the rails on which innovative products can run IDRBT and NPCI to name two Regulation sought actively to facilitate wider participation to include nonbanks eg mobile wallets issued by nonbanks and increase interoperability among different payment systems Popular participation is created through making transactions simple and convenient keeping costs low and minimising risks to customer 2FA or AFA positive confirmation userfriendly switchonswitchoff facility on cardnotpresent or online transactions etc Data storage requirements aim to promote data safety and privacy Customer data protection from cybercrime is being ensured through minimizing vulnerable access points in the system through encouraging tokenisation 13 As the digital payments landscape is maturing RBIs regulatory attention is shifting to the next level of reforms Upscaling of supporting infrastructure like RTGS and NEFT to be available roundtheclock not only improves choices for customers and businesses alike they enhance the availability to nonbanks and reduce settlement risk of satellite payments systems 14 A customer protection framework with limited liability for customers online dispute resolution digital ombudsman scheme etc are unique developmental initiatives We have also benchmarked our payment systems with global best practices These efforts have led to India reporting one of the lowest digital payment fraud rates across the globe 15 To foster innovation the Reserve Bank has come out with enabling framework for Regulatory Sandbox with the objective of fostering orderly and responsible innovation in financial services promoting efficiency and bringing benefit to consumers A Reserve Bank Innovation Hub RBIH has been set up to promote innovation across the financial sector by creating an enabling ecosystem where academics technology finance and regulators are brought together 16 Rapid technological transformation of the financial sector has led to some peculiar challenges One can witness a degree of friction in compliance not characteristic of a typically wellregulated financial system Regulatory initiatives especially those intended for customer convenience or safety often face opposition Resistance to change is couched under the excuse of customer convenience There was a strong pushback when the Reserve Bank introduced 2FA about a decade back although everyone cites it today as a unique success story in Indias payment evolution Nonetheless one can see a persistent tendency to oppose customer friendly reforms eg the introduction of tokenisation to limit storage points of card credentials for customer safety or to ensure 2FA for recurring transactions We would only be able to reach a thriving and mature payments system if over time all stakeholders attach due importance to longterm improvements over shortterm gains and internalise mature practices like informed consent and transparency of data usage 17 Notwithstanding these niggles we have come a long way in promoting digital innovations The JAM trinity has achieved levels of financial inclusion unimaginable for a country the size of India Small businesses and vendors have started adapting to digital payments Yet digital penetration is limited largely to urban and metro areas We need technological solutions to increase penetration to the vast sections of the population which is unbanked and lacks a smartphone Promising options have been identified through the sandbox mechanism and efforts are on to mainstream those technologies 18 While digital payments have become instantaneous within the country the environment for crossborder payments has pretty much stagnated for decades The factors cited are usually the following need for exchange rates timezone differences varying regulatory and legal requirements across different jurisdictions etc Fintech can surely solve these frictions platformbased solutions can make real time price discovery possible even for retail sized transactions CBDCs if both countries have it can make time zone differences disappear by replacing bank settlements with currency delivery which can take place even if the payment systems are closed 19 Another area where fintech holds promise is to prevent digital frauds which has become apparent as the pace of digital penetration has outstripped development of awareness Digital Frauds1 Incidents of digital frauds risen during the pandemic Data from American consumer credit reporting agency TransUnion has found that fraudsters are ramping up their efforts in the financial services industry When comparing the last four months of 2020 Sep 1 Dec 31 and the first four months of 2021 Jan 1 May 1 the company found that the share of suspected digital fraud attempts originating from India against financial services businesses had increased by 89 per cent Globally financial services fraud attempts increased 149 per cent Clearly both regulators and other stakeholders have to play their respective roles effectively to ensure that innovation in the fintech space continues to support Indias economic growth 20 To sum up the fintech landscape can be described in Dickensian terms we are in the best of times with the promise of technological innovation in finance and hope of substantial efficiency gains better customer experience and greater social welfare But we also need to deal with threats of online frauds compromise of customer credentials and data privacy and safety for the spring of hope not to turn into the winter of despair 1 httpswwwtransunioninblogfraudtrendsQ22021

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1331&fn=5,Date Internationalisation of the Rupee Is it time to shift gears,With the transition to a marketbased system for determining the external value of the Indian rupee the foreign exchange market in India gained importance in the early reform period Good Evening It gives me great pleasure to be part of the annual day event of the Foreign Exchange Dealers Association of India FEDAI Since its inception in 1958 FEDAI has played a crucial role in the smooth conduct of foreign exchange business and development of forex markets This role assumes greater significance in todays age of rapidly evolving forex markets and innovations in financial products and instruments 2 The global situation continues to experience uncertainty on multiple fronts be it economics geopolitics or climate related Coming close on the heels of the Covid19 pandemic these challenges have caused the plates of both policymakers and market participants alike to be full I would therefore like to take this opportunity amidst this august gathering to share some thoughts on the progress of the Indian Rupee INR on the path of greater acceptance in international markets or internationalisation its benefits and risks and conclude by offering a few suggestions which might aid the Rupees onward journey Before proceeding it might be a good idea however to do a quick recap of the journey of Rupee markets thus far which will set the backdrop for our main theme of Rupee internationalisation 3 The early stages of foreign exchange management in the country emphasized on control of foreign exchange by regulating demand due to its limited availability Various controls were imposed on forex transactions through the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act FERA of 1947 which was subsequently replaced by a more comprehensive and rigorous framework through FERA 1973 The approach to external sector management underwent a paradigm shift in the 1990s driven by the economic reforms introduced in 1991 In line with the recommendations of the HighLevel Committee on Balance of Payments Chairman Dr C Rangarajan 1993 exchange rate of rupee was made market determined in 1993 In 1994 India accepted Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund IMF making INR fully convertible on the current account With enactment of the Foreign Exchange Management Act FEMA in 1999 to replace FERA the approach shifted from that of conservation to the management of foreign exchange through facilitation of external payments 4 During the last three decades Indias external sector has shown remarkable progress Indias economy has increasingly integrated with the global economy India has emerged as one of the worlds fastest growing economies and a preferred destination for global investors Indias trade exports and imports together barring the hiccup caused by the Pandemic has continued to grow and crossed the USD one trillion mark for the first time during FY 202122 Chart 12 5 On the other hand Indias share in global merchandise trade3 while growing continues to be relatively modest Chart 2 6 Coming to capital flows foreign direct investment FDI4 Chart 3 the preferred type of foreign capital shows a healthy upward trend while foreign portfolio investment FPI5 given its very nature shows a mixed trend Overseas Investments6 OI by Indian residents seem to have consolidated It is hoped that the new Rules and Regulations governing OI will spur the global ambitions of the widely recognized Indian entrepreneurial class 7 External Commercial Borrowings ECB7 Chart 4 vary from year to year and appear to be sensitive to interest differentials 8 Outflow under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme LRS8 is showing a healthy trend Chart 5 reflecting the underlying growth in the Indian economy and is predominantly used for current account transactions 9 India has always been a major recipient of private transfers9 Chart 6 originated by the Indian diaspora These remittances continue to grow over time although their share in global inward remittances has been moving down from 139 to 126 in 202010 10 Finally In the last decade Indias foreign exchange reserves11 Chart 7 have grown from USD 2939 billion in September 2012 to USD 5375 billion in September 2022 Our forex reserves played a critical role in cushioning the impact of severe turmoil witnessed in the global markets in recent months Reserves continue to be healthy and complement the strong macroeconomic fundamentals of the Indian economy With the above brief background let us now examine the prospects of internationalizing the Rupee The Case for Rupee as an international currency 11 An international currency is one that is freely available to nonresidents essentially to settle crossborder transactions It is an expression of external credibility in the currency as well as in the economy All truly international currencies belong to large advanced economies Their use for international transactions confers substantial economic privileges to the host countries In the case of the Dollar the exorbitant12 privileges include immunity from BoP crises as the USA can pay for its external deficits with its own currency The dominance of its financial institutions markets and policies in the global economy the protection for its businesses from currency risk the seigniorage that accrues to it all of these flow from its status as the preeminent reserve currency 12 Clearly one or only a few countries can enjoy such privileges at any given point of time in history And the preconditions size of the economy and a dominant share of global GDP globally dominant businesses extraordinary military capabilities etc limit the prospects of owning an international currency to any but the largest few economies If that is the case why am I talking of internationalisation of the Rupee I would like to clarify this point by drawing a distinction between the status of Rupee as an international currency and the process of internationalisation of the Rupee Rupee as an international currency with all its attendant privileges that we saw USD enjoys is a state that lies well into the future It is not achievable by financial regulation alone as the preconditions we listed for dollar dominance clearly illustrate Therefore the status of Rupee as an international currency is not what we are discussing here today 13 But we can make tangible progress towards internationalisation of the Rupee This is a process that involves increasing use of the Rupee in crossborder transactions Broadly the process involves promoting Rupee for import and export trade and then other current account transactions followed by its use in capital account transactions These are all transactions between residents in India and nonresidents Use of Rupee for transactions between nonresidents would be a decisive vote of confidence in Rupees internationalisation but that is a step which belongs to the final stages of Rupee internationalisation and not a priority at this stage 14 Why do I think internationalisation of the Rupee is a desirable objective of public policy Some of the advantage are fairly obvious as explained below Use of Rupee in crossborder transactions mitigates currency risk for Indian business Protection from currency volatility not only reduces cost of doing business it also enables better growth of business improving the chances for Indian business to grow globally It reduces the need for holding foreign exchange reserves While reserves help manage exchange rate volatility and project external stability they impose a cost on the economy For example there is a general agreement that Indias reserves are borrowed funds Banks and corporate incur external debt at market rates which are then invested in Government securities issued by advanced economies AEs The rate at which external debt is incurred is substantially higher than the return on reserves Assuming an interest differential of 2 on a Reserve base of say USD 600 billion the cost of reserves would work out to USD 12 billion annually This cost represents a transfer of income from India to AEs Reducing the requirement of reserves would save some of this this loss of income Reducing dependence on foreign currency makes India less vulnerable to external shocks For example during phases of monetary tightening in US and strengthening dollar excessive foreign currency liabilities of domestic business results in a de facto domestic tightening The Taper Tantrum episode in 2013 and the currency volatility experienced by most emerging market economies EMEs in recent months exemplify such risks Reduced exposure to currency risk would substantially mitigate the pain of reversal of capital flows As the use of Rupee becomes significant the bargaining power of Indian business would improve adding weight to the Indian economy enhancing Indias global stature and respect 15 How do we go about the process of internationalisation of the Rupee We have in fact taken the initial steps Enabling external commercial borrowings in Rupees especially Masala Bonds was one step Though invoicing export and import in Rupees was long permitted it was being resorted to for limited uses The July 2022 Scheme of RBI permitting Rupee settlement of external trade created a more comprehensive framework including the flexibility of investing surplus Rupees in Indian bond markets We are receiving encouraging response from countries to participate in Rupeebased trading The Asian Clearing Union is also exploring a scheme of using domestic currencies for settlement An arrangement bilateral or among trading blocs which offers importers of each country the choice to pay in domestic currency is likely to be favoured by all countries and therefore is worth exploring 16 As increased use of Rupee in crossborder transactions requires a unified global market in Rupee both in interest rates and currencies Such unification would not only improve depth and liquidity of our markets but they would also facilitate uniform pricing across borders Accordingly Reserve Bank has also been putting in place enabling conditions by way of linking the domestic Rupee interest rates and currency markets with offshore Rupee markets by enabling domestic banks to operate in the offshore markets Concomitantly Primary Dealers PDs have been allowed market making in forex markets to improve market liquidity Further steps in this direction are enhancing transparency of global Rupee markets through a comprehensive Reporting framework A desirable outcome would be if marketmakers like banks and PDs centralize their global Rupee book in India Among other benefits this would improve risk management for Indian and global firms alike and enhance the global role for Indias financial sector 17 We have so far discussed the advantages Let us know consider the risks India is a capital deficient country and hence needs foreign capital to fund its growth If a substantial portion of its trade is in Rupee nonresidents would hold Rupee balances in India which would be used to acquire Indian assets Large holdings of such financial assets could heighten vulnerability to external shocks managing which would necessitate more effective policy tools A reduced role for convertible currencies in external transactions could lead to reduced reserve accretion At the same time however the need for reserves would also reduce to the extent the trade deficit is funded in Rupees Nonresident holdings of Rupees could exacerbate passthrough of external stimulus to domestic financial markets increasing volatility For instance a global riskoff phase could lead nonresidents to convert their Rupee holdings and move out of India 18 These risks are real but they are unavoidable if India is to progress to be an economic superpower Macroeconomic policy would need to measure up to such risks Internationalisation would make domestic monetary policy more challenging but the alternative of compromising on growth by playing it safe is clearly not an optimal choice We need to calibrate our moves to the evolving size of our economy particularly the size of the external sector and to our appetite for risk in framing policy for external trade and capital flows But the direction is clear 1 Keynote address delivered by Shri T Rabi Sankar Deputy Governor Reserve Bank of India at the Annual Day event of the Foreign Exchange Dealers Association of

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1133&fn=5,Date Indias Capital Account Management An assessment,With the transition to a marketbased system for determining the external value of the Indian rupee the foreign exchange market in India gained importance in the early reform period 1 In the previous FEDAI Annual Day address in November 2020 Governor Shri Shaktikanta Das had observed that CAC will continue to be approached as a process rather than an event What I will do in this address is to expand on that theme and bring into focus some of the important issues on which in my opinion further public debate is warranted to continue along this process of capital account convertibility What is capital account convertibility 2 The balance of payments BOP of a country records all economic transactions of a country that is of its individuals businesses and governments with the rest of the world during a defined period usually one year These transactions are broadly divided into two heads current account and capital account The current account covers exports and imports of goods and services factor income and unilateral transfers The capital account records the net change in foreign assets and liabilities held by a country Convertibility refers to the ability to convert domestic currency into foreign currencies and vice versa to make payments for balance of payments transactions Current account convertibility is the ability or freedom to convert domestic currency for current account transactions while capital account convertibility is the ability or freedom to convert domestic currency for capital account transactions The Tarapore Committee 2006 for instance defined capital account convertibility as the freedom to convert local financial assets into foreign financial assets and vice versa 3 The degree of BOP convertibility of a country usually depends on the level of its economic development and degree of maturity of its financial markets Therefore advanced economies AEs are almost fully convertible while emerging market economies EMEs are convertible to different degrees Why is capital account convertibility important 4 Free capital mobility or internationalization of capital markets is commonly recognized as an engine of global growth Specifically benefits of internationalization of capital markets are well accepted in terms of broadening the investor base for recipient country financial assets improved liquidity in financial markets and positive pressures for market infrastructure and market practices International capital markets by enabling access to a global savings pool and to different currencies can potentially reduce borrowing costs facilitate better risk allocation and enhance global liquidity OECD 20172 What are the risks of free capital mobility and how are these risks managed 5 The various currency and banking crises experienced over the last few decades have simultaneously highlighted the costs and risks of internationalization such as exposure to global shocks credit and asset bubbles exchange rate volatility associated with sudden exit of capital and higher refinancing risk Increased globalization has brought to the fore the vulnerability to contagion effects While it was argued that such risks are the shortterm pains needed to reap long term gains Kaminsky and others 20083 there is now a wider acceptance that benefits of internationalization are not an unmixed blessing and that there is a nuanced trade off between growth and crisis risk Such awareness has led to policy focus on three fronts a First that benefits of internationalization presupposes sound macroeconomic fundamentals a well developed financial system and a sound market infrastructure including efficient markets for funding and risk transfer b Second that countries need to develop appropriate tools to deal with the risks of internationalization in particular tools to manage the volume and composition of capital inflows and macro prudential tools c And third that different types of capital flows carry different risks some are riskier than others The agreed hierarchy of capital flows is that foreign direct investment is the least risky followed by equity investment followed by debt capital While FDI is seen to contribute to longrun growth portfolio equity gives a shorter run boost Debt flows while necessary are susceptible to be volatile Understandably the focus of capital flow regulations and macroprudential regulations has been debt flows 6 Capital flow measures are effective insofar as they lead to safer external liability structures by reducing dependence on foreign borrowing and could be particularly effective during suddenstop episodes They work essentially by avoiding risky flows or containing shortterm debt or controlling currency exposure of domestic borrowers Especially for economies where capital flows are relatively large or the exposure of banking systems is significant these measures could be more effective than macro prudential tools 7 Macro prudential measures target systemic stability issues and tend to be capital based or liquidity based or borrower based Capital based measures like counter cyclical capital buffers or higherthanstandard capital requirements or calibration of capital risk weights intended to change incentives for certain types of funding are commonly used Liquidity Coverage Ratio or Net Stable Funding Ratio can be used to manage exposure to short term flows Similarly credit or asset bubbles can be controlled using LoantoValue ratio or Debt ServicetoIncome ratios 8 There is extensive global discussion on the choice and effectiveness of these tools to deal with specific vulnerabilities There is reasonable consensus that none of these measures is undesirable in itself There is also broad agreement on the sequencing of these measures That the first line of defence against risks of capital flows are prudent macroeconomic policies and a strong institutional base External borrowing should be controlled until corporate governance and supervisory standards are robust 9 Not all emerging economies however may have this choice and may be constrained to depend on capital flows either to meet their investment needs or to develop financial markets For many of these countries the required development of policy and markets has to happen simultaneously with dependence on foreign capital Often there is only a limited choice on the type of capital that flows in leading to dependence on risky debt capital Managing these flows with a notsoefficient domestic institutional base requires policy flexibility Usually managing the spillover risks of global capital involves a combination of these and macro prudential measures Building up reserves has been an acceptable course especially after the Asian crisis Having some control on the amount of debt capital as well as on its nature is another defence Longterm debt flows could be preferred to shortterm flows stable investors pension or insurance funds reserve portfolios could be preferred to flighty investors such as carry traders arbitrage traders etc In a sense capital flow measures may really be used to compensate for lack of strong macrofundamentals and adjustment mechanisms Fratzscher 20124 10 Thus capital flows are useful and in case of many EMEs even necessary The choice is in how to manage the attendant risks Effective management of these risks especially those associated with debt flows requires a diversified policy toolkit Which of these is used is basically a function of the degree of development of the economy and markets of the country Capital flow management in India 11 External sector liberalisation started in India with the economic liberalisation process that commenced in the early nineties moving to a a floating exchange rate regime and freeing up current account transactions The enactment of the Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999 codified this arrangement with relatively free current account transactions except for a negative list and controlled capital account transactions Liberalisation in this context basically meant gradually freeing up capital account transactions Over the last two decades FDI has become more or less unrestricted except i for some sectoral caps and ii restrictions in a few socially sensitive eg gambling or volatile eg real estate or strategic eg atomic energy sectors 12 The policy regime for foreign portfolio investments in India commenced in 1992 when Foreign Institutional Investors FIIs or since January 2014 FPIs were allowed to invest in domestic financial instruments basically equity FPIs were given access to corporate debt markets in 1995 and to Gsecs in 1997 Thus the FPI regime has followed the standard process of liberalising equity flows first and then gradually freeing up debt capital Apart from sectoral caps to regulate control portfolio flows into equities in India are virtually unrestricted Access to debt markets sovereign and corporate is subject to macro caps and other macroprudential limits These are designed to safeguard the domestic economy from excessively speculative hot money flows 13 There is an effort to liberalize FPI debt flows further with the introduction of the Fully Accessible Route FAR which places no limit on nonresident investment in specified benchmark securities Since over time virtually all securities will fall under the FAR category the move is unambiguously towards an eventual unfettered access for nonresidents into Government securities Efforts to get India included under global bond indexes and the complementary move towards placing Gsecs under global custodians once implemented will encourage debt flows in future 14 The first comprehensive guidelines on External Commercial Borrowing ECB were issued by Government in July 1999 It has been liberalised over time Currently ECB by corporates while more open than portfolio flows seeks to enable medium to long term debt minimum tenor only healthy corporates to borrow through cost ceilings subject to an overall soft limit A few end uses real estate capital market equity are not permitted 15 Chart 1 see Annex for all charts shows that the actual flows of capital have been broadly in the desirable direction with direct investments FDI flows outstripping portfolio investments FPI flows and equity flows FDI plus FPI equity5 outstripping debt flows FPI Debt plus ECB The gradual liberalization of capital inflows has been consistent with the realization of the preferred composition of capital inflows 16 The focus on capital outflows has understandably been far less given that Indias priority is to attract foreign capital to fund its savings gap There is basically one channel Overseas Direct Investment ODI The Liberalized Remittance Scheme LRS for individuals while it is open for both current and capital account transactions is largely more than 90 in current account transactions like travel studies etc Issues for wider debate 17 While the progress so far can be considered to have moved broadly along the desirable direction there are some issues which require a wider debate as there are no standard answers We will discuss some of these issues below a With the Fully Accessible Route as discussed above over time the entire Gsec issuance would be eligible for nonresident investment While experience of other countries suggest that nonresidents are unlikely to hold a major portion of outstanding stock substantial debt holdings might make India vulnerable to the risk of sudden reversals Since this channel was permitted in the context of inclusion of Indias Gsecs in global bond indices there is a natural safety mechanism as index investors are unlikely to indulge in sudden reversals It may need to be considered from a macroprudential perspective whether FAR should be linked to index inclusion b As the LRS Scheme has operated for some time there may be a need to review it keeping in mind the changing requirements such as higher education for the youth requirement of startups etc There might even be a case for reviewing whether the limit can remain uniform or can be linked to some economic variable for individuals c A key aspect of currency convertibility is integration of financial markets Over time it is essential that two markets onshore and offshore for domestic currency or interest rates cannot exist with efficiency With increased convertibility these markets need to be linked An effort has already commenced in the interest rate derivative segment Allowing Indian banks access to NDF markets for the Rupee is also consistent with this objective As Gsecs get held by global custodians and traded abroad more and more nonresidents get to hold Rupee assets and take Rupee exposure These measures are already seeing the desired results for instance NDFonshore spreads have substantially narrowed after allowing Indian banks into the NDF space Chart 2 see Annex We need to now consider whether India is ready to allow such nonresidents to hold Rupee accounts This will be an important early step in internationalization of the Rupee and therefore needs to be carefully considered Further there is a need to consider a proper mechanism for information flow so that exchange and interest rate management can continue to be effective in an environment of larger offshore transactions d As onshore and offshore financial markets get integrated it should be ensured that price discovery in the domestic markets is efficient lest flows move to the offshore segment Take the case of the Rupee exchange rate It is market determined with fairly tight bidask spreads in the interbank market Major corporates also seem to benefit from tight pricing Yet many entities especially SMEs small exporters individuals etc are prone to overpricing Do processing charges and market risk for warehousing odd lot positions justify these spreads An effective way is to shift price discovery for the retail forex users to a platform While such a platform FX Retail has been developed it appears that banks do not find it in their interest to navigate customers to use that platform In this age of technology it may not really be possible to shun superior technology for any length of time There should be a debate on the use of the platform and banks should make an effort to give it a fair trial Conclusion 18 India has come a long way in achieving increasing levels of convertibility on the capital account It has broadly achieved the desired outcome for the policy choices it has made in terms of achieving a stable composition of foreign capital inflow At the same time India is on the cusp of some fundamental shifts in this space with increased market integration in the offing and freer nonresident access to debt on the table The rate of change in capital convertibility will only increase with each of these and similar measures With that comes the responsibility to ensure that such flows are managed effectively with the right combination of capital flow measures macroprudential measures and market intervention All of us need to consider deeply the issues I have highlighted above and arrive at effective solutions Market participants particularly banks will have to prepare themselves to manage the business process changes and the global risks associated with capital convertibility The regulators job is somewhat different As someone once said the job of a regulator is like the gas regulator in the kitchen it cannot ensure the quality of the dish but it can prevent the kitchen from blowing up The quality of the dish that is the efficiency with which investment needs of the country are met is up to how well Authorized Dealers and other intermediaries adjust to the increasingly fuller capital account convertibility Annex Charts 1 Speech delivered

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1085&fn=5,Date Dimensions of Indias External Sector Resilience,With the transition to a marketbased system for determining the external value of the Indian rupee the foreign exchange market in India gained importance in the early reform period The international environment is clouded with very challenging conditions Global growth is slowing down and central banks across the world are bracing up to counter it by easing monetary policy but there is no recession as yet Trade wars have pushed world trade into contraction and threaten to morph into tech and currency wars with no evidence of any significant gains accruing to anyone Meanwhile global commodity prices have weakened with collateral benefits to net commodity importers and terms of trade losses for commodity exporters The developments emanating from drone strikes on Saudi oil facilities are however still playing out Sporadic flights to safety are driving capital flows out of emerging markets into advanced economy assets but the universe of negative yielding bonds is growing disconcertingly large posing a potential threat to financial stability Strengths and Weaknesses 2 In this hostile environment Indias external sector has exhibited resilience and viability The current account deficit has averaged 14 per cent of GDP over the last 5 years and remains comfortably financed in spite of global spillovers imparting riskonriskoff volatility to portfolio flows The level of foreign exchange reserves was at US 429 billion on September 13 2019 sufficient to cover close to 10 months of imports or 21 months of debt of residual maturity up to 1 year The Indian economy remains a preferred habitat for foreign direct investment FDI and is among the top 10 destinations for greenfield projects Source FDI Report Financial Times 2018 Net foreign direct investment at US 183 billion in AprilJuly 2019 was higher than US 114 billion in the corresponding period of 201819 3 Significant progress has been made in external debt management since the external payment difficulties encountered in 1990 which triggered wideranging structural adjustments and reforms The level of external debt at 197 per cent of GDP and the debt service ratio principal repayments and interest payments as a ratio of current earnings at 64 per cent of GDP are among the lowest in emerging market peers This places India among the least externally indebted countries of the world by the World Banks classification In terms of a broader measure of external liabilities the net international investment position NIIP which includes both debt and equity liabilities net of foreign assets Indias exposure declined to 159 per cent of GDP at endMarch 2019 from a peak level of 183 per cent at endMarch 2015 Foreign exchange reserves covered 76 per cent of external debt and 946 per cent of the NIIP at endMarch 2019 up from 682 per cent and 893 per cent respectively at endMarch 2014 Shortterm debt by residual maturity declined to 57 per cent of foreign exchange reserves at endMarch 2019 from a peak level of 59 per cent at endMarch 2013 Shortterm debt by original maturity constitutes barely 20 per cent of total external debt 4 These healthy developments are underpinned by the innate strength of Indias underlying fundamentals The degree of openness of the economy measured by the ratio of exports and imports of goods and services to GDP has risen from 20 per cent in the first half of the 1990s to 44 per cent in the latest fiveyear period from 201419 The share of Indias merchandise exports in world exports has gone up from 05 per cent in 1990 to 17 per cent in 2018 5 In line with the expanding share of services in domestic output Indias services exports have grown rapidly over the past two decades In fact Indias services exports have shown a higher degree of resilience to global shocks than merchandise exports At US 819 billion net services exports financed 45 per cent of Indias trade deficit in 201819 In the area of traded services India remains a world leader in software exports and information technology IT enabled services accounting for around 12 per cent of world software exports Indias IT sector which earned US 78 billion through net exports in 201819 is leapfrogging into new technologies including artificial intelligence machine learning and robotics The Indian diaspora is among the largest in the world and reflecting this India currently receives the highest amount inward remittances in the world from Indians working abroad Alongside accretions to nonresident deposits have provided stable and reliable support to the balance of payments over the years Financial openness measured by the ratio of gross capital inflows and outflows to GDP has increased threefold from 15 per cent in the first half of the 1990s to 45 per cent during 201419 6 Notwithstanding these achievements there are several areas of concern as well which occupy centrestage in the conduct of external sector management First merchandise exports have lost momentum under the weight of the slump in world trade In spite of export volume growth averaging 42 per cent during 201318 UNCTAD 2019 Indias export growth in US dollar terms has weakened as in a host of emerging and advanced economies to 22 per cent over the same period as falling unit value realisations have taken their toll The slowdown in global demand has affected our exports of petroleum products as well they constitute 14 per cent of total merchandise exports Second the deceleration in domestic demand has pulled imports especially nonoil nongold imports into contraction and this has reduced the inflow of intermediates capital goods and technology that is vital for modernising our infrastructure and industry Third portfolio flows which on average account for about 23 per cent of external financing in a normal year have turned highly volatile with net outflows of US 06 billion in 201819 During 201920 so far up to September 13 portfolio equity outflows were of the order of US 14 billion but lower than US 29 billion in the corresponding period a year ago Net inflows into the debt market of US 41 billion have however provided relief Moreover these portfolio capital movements have turned out to be conduits of global spillovers impacting domestic equity debt and forex markets and asset prices Nonetheless the underlying resilience of Indias external sector anchored by the positive features I set out earlier have cushioned these shocks and insulated the domestic economy Managing the External Sector 7 Against this backdrop I would like to turn to several recent initiatives undertaken by the Reserve Bank of India and the Government of India to fortify Indias external position and improve the capacity of the economy to deal with the headwinds that confront us in these testing times Exports 8 Exports hold the key to a sustainable balance of payments position In the final analysis liabilities in the form of debt and even equities cannot entirely substitute for foreign exchange earnings from exports of goods and services that create import purchasing power and liability servicing capacity Over the years the policy endeavour has been to secure a wide diversification in Indias export profile in terms of both products and destinations In particular product diversification has enabled India to broaden its export basket relative to BRICS peers and reduce its vulnerability to trade shocks Apart from diversification India is now exporting sunrise products like electronics chemicals and drugs and pharmaceuticals for which demand is expanding at the global level In the smart phone segment of electronic goods India has transformed itself from being a net importer to an exporter with the impetus from the phased manufacturing programme 9 Looking ahead several initiatives have been put in place and others are being launched on an ongoing basis to enable export industries to regain productivity and cutting edge competitiveness They include upgradation of export facilities integration of Indian farmers and their products with global value chains and trade facilitation measures More recently efforts are going into reimbursement of taxes and duties including electronic refund of input tax credits in GST An action plan for 12 champion services sectors including IT tourism and hospitality and medical services has been developed since February 2018 The Reserve Bank and the Government are actively engaged in the promotion of ecommerce platforms that will boost the exports of both merchandise and services All these steps seek to create a more conducive climate for exports Capital Flows 10 With regard to capital flows India has adopted an approach marked by progressive liberalisation but calibrated to the realities of the domestic situation including the evolution of financial markets A diverse range of instruments for managing exchange rate risk for an expanding investor base has come into play Indias hierarchical policy approach preferring equity flows over debt flows and preferring FDI flows over portfolio flows within equity flows and longterm debt flows over shortterm flows within total debt flows has influenced the composition of capital flows 11 Turning to equity flows FDI policy has been progressively liberalised across various sectors in recent years to make India an attractive investment destination Sectors that have been opened up in recent years include defence construction development trading pharmaceuticals power exchanges insurance pensions financial services asset reconstruction broadcasting and civil aviation 100 per cent FDI has also been allowed in insurance intermediaries In August 2019 FDI norms in singlebrand retail trade have been further liberalised FDI up to 100 per cent has been permitted under the automatic route in contract manufacturing and coal mining 12 With regard to foreign portfolio investment FPI several measures have been undertaken to create an investorfriendly regime and to put in place a more predictable policy environment FPI limits are now being revised on a half yearly basis under the mediumterm framework FPI has been allowed in municipal bonds within the limits set for State Development Loans SDLs1 Greater operational flexibility has been granted to FPIs under a Voluntary Retention Route VRR which facilitates investment in Gsecs SDLs treasury bills and corporate bonds while allowing investors to dynamically manage their currency and interest rate risks The initial response to the VRR scheme has been encouraging The Union Budget 201920 proposed to ease KYC norms for FPIs and also merge the NRI portfolio route with the FPI route for seamless investment in stock markets Outward direct and portfolio investment have also been progressively liberalised to give Indian entities a global scan and presence 13 External borrowing norms have also been simplified under two tracks foreign currency denominated ECBs and rupee denominated ECBs The list of eligible borrowers has been expanded to include all entities eligible to receive FDI registered entities engaged in microfinance activities registered societiestrustscooperatives and nongovernment organisations A rulebased dynamic limit for outstanding stock of ECBs at 65 per cent of GDP is in place Rupee denominated bonds or Masala bonds under the ECB route offer an opportunity to domestic firms to borrow from international markets without the need for hedging exchange rate risk ECBs up to US 750 million or equivalent per financial year are permitted under the automatic route Recently enduse restrictions relating to external commercial borrowings have also been relaxed for specific eligible borrowers for their working capital requirements general corporate purposes and repayment of rupee loans The mandatory hedging requirement had earlier been reduced from 100 per cent to 70 per cent for ECBs with minimum average maturity period between 3 and 5 years in the infrastructure space Net disbursement of ECBs rose to US 77 billion in AprilJuly 2019 as against net repayments of US 08 billion in the corresponding period of 201819 Exchange Rate 14 Before concluding it is only fair to say a few words about the exchange rate of the rupee Over the last couple of years the exchange rate has seen large twoway movements with considerable volatility imparted mainly by global spillovers During 201920 so far the rupee has traded in a narrow range with modest appreciation in Q1 giving way to some depreciation in August and the first half of September accentuated by drone attacks on Saudi oil facilities on September 14 2019 In its External Sector Report of July 2019 the International Monetary Fund IMF has employed a suite of models to assess the alignment of currencies with their fundamentals For the rupee the IMF estimates the REER gap to be zero implying that the currency is fairly valued and broadly in line with fundamentals Indias exchange rate regime is flexible and marketdriven with the exchange rate being determined by the forces of demand and supply The RBI has no target or band for the level of the exchange rate Interventions are intended to manage undue volatility This is reflected in the twosided interventions conducted during the past two years net purchases in 201718 followed by net sales in 201819 In fact it is in recognition of this flexibility that the US Department of the Treasury has removed India from its watch list relating to currency manipulation Conclusion 15 Overall the outlook for Indias external sector is one of cautious optimism albeit with some downside risks accentuated at this juncture Among them deepening of the global slowdown and escalation of trade and geopolitical tensions appear to be the most significant Volatile international crude prices also continue to pose potential risks to the viability of the current account balance through trade and remittances channels Yet there are underlying strengths that can be built upon to buffer the external sector from these risks The search for new export markets and new niches must go on so as to reap the benefits of changing dynamics of global value chains Indian IT companies need to accelerate market diversification and invest in new skills and technologies to hone their comparative advantage Remittances and nonresident deposits are likely to remain shockabsorbers over the medium term and need to be assiduously cultivated including by ease of remittingdepositing and reducing transaction costs 16 Ultimately the strength of the external sector derives from domestic macrofundamentals Investors and markets need to be credibly assured of our ability to maintain macroeconomic and financial stability through continued focus on these areas At the same time we need to persevere with structural reforms in various sectors of the economy to unlock productivity and competitiveness gains The overarching objective should be to keep the current account deficit within sustainable limits and financed by a prudent mix of debt and equity flows As I stated earlier the global environment is challenging but it offers opportunities as well By the IMFs assessment India will account for a sixth of global growth in 2020 Trade wars are presenting new business relocation avenues that seem to be favourable to India from the point of view of the economies of scale and scope Indian entrepreneurship the rupee and our people are progressively but inexorably internationalising Since 2018 Indias working age population has grown larger than the dependent population and this demographic advantage is expected to last till 2055 In this milieu prudent external sector management with a close and continuous vigil on areas of external vulnerability assumes critical importance and will continue to receive RBIs close attention Thank you 1 The limits for FPI investment in Central Government securities Gsecs State Development Loans SDLs and corporate bonds are fixed currently at 6 per cent 2 per cent and 9 per cent of respective outstanding stocks of securities for FY 201920
https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1074&fn=5,Date Indias growing significance in global arena Is it Sustainable Are we ready for it,With the transition to a marketbased system for determining the external value of the Indian rupee the foreign exchange market in India gained importance in the early reform period 1 It is a great pleasure to be amidst you today and I wish to thank FEDAI and the organisers of this conference for the privilege to speak to you FEDAI has been playing a seminal role in steering the crossborder transactions of the members of public as well as interbank transactions in the foreign exchange market for more than six decades now It may be recalled that FEDAI was formed to secularise foreign exchange transactions in the early days when only select branches of foreign banks were conducting these transactions Over time the statutory framework enjoined upon the foreign exchange dealers an additional role as authorised dealers a role so comprehensive that they share the responsibility for administering the regulatory regime FEDAI as organisation of authorisedforex dealers has played its role remarkably well and if we are expanding the set of players in the foreign exchange market today a part of the credit goes to FEDAI in creating the necessary skill abundantly and widely in dealing with foreign exchange I am sure it will continue to play a constructive role and help market participants grapple with the challenges that a market as prone to volatility and uncertainty as the foreign exchange market will spring from time to time 2 These annual conferences since 2006 have been an important event or should I say the most important event that the participants in the foreign exchange market look forward to It provides an opportunity for networking and exchange of ideas for the market participants It also provides a welcome respite from the heat and dust of the marketplace I cannot but commend the choice of the venue this year particularly with a view on the theme of this years event China and India have been comradesatarms for millennias sharing their journeys in multiple dimensions commercial as well as civilizational Angus Maddison1 estimates that India and China were the worlds two largest economies until the early 18th century China is the worlds largest economy today on PPP basis and India is the third largest If you add the exports and imports China is Indias largest trading partner 201718 data Among the fastest growing economies the engagement between the two countries can be expected to see phenomenal growth in the times to come 3 The theme chosen for this conference is Indias growing significance in international arena Is it sustainable Are we ready for it These are interesting and important issues and as we shall see quite relevant to our common functional domain Now importance in the international sphere has many dimensions cultural military moral strategic to name a few but the dimension that underpins all others is economic If you look at the history of mankind it is economic prosperity that has always dictated the importance of a nation Whether we look at the Italian city states of the 15th16th century many of Shakespeares plays were situated in these places Verona to Venice and one wonders whether the renaissance would have been possible but for the wealth and backing of the Mediccis and others or the British of the 18th19th century Britain became the dominant global power for two centuries and English became the lingua franca it is the economic prosperity that made the nations internationally important The preeminence of China today is to a great extent due to its phenomenal economic success 4 We also must notice that economic prosperity has almost always been inextricably linked with international trade and commerce capital movements are recent phenomenon The need for free trade and commerce became important as the industrial revolution greatly increased productivity Of course it was not in the sense we now understand Till middle of the nineteenth century mercantilism was the dominant policy driver in Europe Essentially while it favoured exports of all commodities except gold it sought to discourage imports through tariffs Ultimately with repeal of the British Corn Laws in 1846 the case for free trade had been decisively established The doctrine that free trade enhances welfare has been further strengthened by subsequent research at least at a theoretical plane Despite the fact that global economic growth and growth in global trade have moved in tandem over the past two centuries arguments in favour of import substitution selective protection subsidies abound One can perhaps reasonably conclude that while the global objective will continue to be less restrictive trade local variations will have to be considered keeping in view other macroeconomic factors like fiscal policy exchange rate policy employment policy and so on 5 Unlike trade in goods and services the case for capital flows has not been clear We must appreciate that restrictions on capital flows were enshrined in the Bretton Woods system However after the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in the early seventies a set of strong arguments emerged in favour of free capital flows and was endorsed by IMF In the wake of the far eastern crisis of the late 1990s the debate about its desirability was revived The debate again came to life after the global financial crisis and there has been a general agreement since that and I quote the words of Harry Dexter White one of the principal architects of the Bretton Woods the desirability of encouraging the flow of productive capital to areas where it can be most profitably employed needs no emphasis but there are periods when failure to manage flows have led to serious economic disruption Keynes was in agreement 6 The reason I have dealt with the propositions relating to trade and capital flows is to bring out the point that there is no universally acceptable policy prescription relating to either Both theory and empirics accommodate the possibility of specific sets of policy appropriate to a countrys idiosyncratic requirements and it is in this backdrop that we shall consider our policies in respect of crossborder transactions past and present 7 There are several dimensions of the regime for cross border transactions but what we shall be concerned with in this discussion is that relating to exchange control or rather foreign exchange management The foreign exchange management policy ultimately hinges on two factors the quantity of foreign exchange available and the exchange rate This has guided the evolution of the exchange control regime in India and indeed elsewhere in the world 8 The wartime exchange control through administrative fiat was converted to a statutory regime in 1947 through the FERA 1947 The acute shortage of foreign exchange in the 1960s and various other factors such as food shortage wars etc led to a more stringent regime through the FERA 1973 Foreign exchange per se was considered important and the policy regime comprised rules to grudgingly allocate foreign exchange to various demands Import control and promotion of import substitution provided complimentary policy instruments Beginning midseventies soon after the enactment of FERA1973 but not necessarily because of it the situation relating to the external sector started improving primarily because of increasing remittances from Indian diaspora and impact of green revolution Thus through the 1980s there was progressive and incremental liberalisation in cross border transactions albeit within the same paradigm Two observations are in order here First the liberalisation in exchange control regime was not accompanied by any significant changes in other economic policies Second although the BrettonWoods regime broke down in early 1970s and many currencies started floating the rupee continued to be in a pegged exchangerate system first to pound sterling and then to a basket of currencies Thus the foreign exchange crisis once again surfaced in early nineties The policy response in the aftermath of the crisis this time was a comprehensive reform As far as regulating cross border transactions are concerned I would like to mention three landmarks a adoption of a market determined exchange rate system in 1993 b Commitment to conform to Article 8 of the IMF charter current account convertibility in 1994 and c Enactment of FEMA in 1999 removing the shackles of a repressive regime It was a new paradigm 9 We have lived through this paradigm for nigh two and a half decades now There have been cadences in the policy regime from time to time but the basic tenets remain the same and will continue to guide the evolution of policy framework in future Let me draw your attention to the preamble of the FEMA 1999 which very aptly summarises the philosophy behind how we regulate the cross border transactions It goes An Act to consolidate and amend the law relating to foreign exchange with the objective of facilitating external trade and payments and for promoting the orderly development and maintenance of foreign exchange market in India 10 As far as current account is concerned the statute mandates that there shall be no restrictions except such that are placed by the Central Government in consultation with the Reserve Bank The restrictions that figure in the rulebook mostly relate to some socially undesirable nonpriority activities like gambling transactions that can be used to dress capital accounts transactions as current account transactions and some with strategic implications There is also some asymmetry in practice if not in precept between the current account transactions that involve an outward remittance and those that involve an inward one The regulatory framework for current account transactions has been pretty stable I may mention in passing that transaction in services has been growing steadily in keeping with Indias reputation as an outsourcing hub While a comprehensive system for collection of aggregate statistics for compilation of the balance of payment is in place perhaps we need to develop a system to capture transaction level data similar to that for merchandise trade to improve our understanding and guide policy action wherever necessary 11 Let me now turn to the capital account transactions The statute provides that the Reserve Bank and when the 2015 amendment to FEMA 1999 is notified the Central Government in some classes of transactions will regulate which capital account transactions are permitted and to what extent and subject to what conditions Partly because of this construct of the statutory provisions but mostly because of the evolving macroeconomic conditions during the past two decades majority of the policy actions have related to the capital account 12 As I mentioned earlier starting the 1970s and through the 1980s and well into the 1990s there was a strong advocacy of full capital account convertibility by the free market proponents This culminated in the 1994 Madrid Declaration of the IMF to encourage the member countries to remove impediments to capital flows However subsequent global economic developments have modified the stance and it is now admitted that capital controls can indeed be used an instrument for macroeconomic and financial stability The goalpost has now shifted from convertibility an event to capital account liberalisation a process This raises issues about the pace and composition of the liberalisation the drivers of which are eclectic and country specific rather than based on universal principles Broadly three determining factors are important a the preconditions for opening up of capital account b the cost and effectiveness of capital account restrictions and c monetary policy implications of an increasingly open capital account Of course the stability and orderly conditions in the forex market remains the proximate determinant of the policies relating to capital flows In our case while capital inflows serve the twin purposes of bridging the ExportImport gap and the savingsinvestment gap the above considerations will determine the approach to regulation 13 There are usually three preconditions for capital account liberalisation discussed price stability fiscal stability and stability of the financial institutions and markets As we speak to day achievements in respect of the stated parameters vary The fiscal deficit at the General Government level needs consolidation It is desirable that growth along with low inflation and fiscal prudence become well entrenched before we take quantum steps towards a more open capital account Besides there are signs of global headwinds though in the distant horizons 14 While the nuances of capital account liberalisation is a matter of detail some broad policy prerogatives relating to the hierarchy of capital flows can be mentioned First capital flows particularly for the real sector will always have priority over flows into the financial sector Second equity related capital inflows will have preference over debt inflows Within the equity flows direct investment flows will be preferred to portfolio flows and in so far as debt flows are concerned preference for long term debt and rupeedenominated debt whether bilaterally contracted or through marketable securities shall continue You are aware of the policy changes in recent times in respect of foreign direct investment external commercial borrowing trade credit etc However the changes constitute mostly rationalisation and consolidation rather than any significant change in stance 15 The investment requirement of the Indian economy is and will continue to be quite large Apart from the usual ICORdriven investment to support the desired growth huge investments are also required for the physical and social infrastructure sector These latter investments have their own challenges in terms of long and uncertain execution period long payback period etc The world today is flush with longterm savings in the nature of pension funds and corpus of insurance companies our policy regime need to be nimble and accomodative enough to direct these to productive ventures in India We are working towards this 16 Talking of the need of infrastructure sectors we cannot help notice the emergence of a new class of investors venture capital and private equity funds Anecdotal reports seem to suggest that in the last few years investment by these funds constitute about 3540 of the FDI inflows Important as the role of VC and PE funds is as the mediator between long term investors like pension funds insurance companies sovereign funds trusts endowments etc on the one hand and potential growth industries on the other these investments have different structural and behavioural characteristics The current regime permits wide latitude of freedom to VC investors in select sectors perceived to be economically important but risky for normal FDI Perhaps there is a need to consider private equity investment in its totality and see if a modulation of policy regime is warranted including wider and innovative debt funding hybrid instruments etc particularly in so far as they relate to priority areas such as infrastructure nonconventional energy health education and other social impact areas This is engaging our attention 17 The issues relating to startups are extremely important Business has evolved in ways that could not have been foreseen a short while ago It has become a clich to cite the examples of the largest transportation company that does not own a cab the largest retail company that does not own a store and so on Technology and internet have and are continuing to revolutionise the service industry Most of the startups have immensely contributed to employment generation Should we create a preferential FDI regime for activities with large employment potential given the importance of employment in the economy The startups have great appetite for funds in their growing phase and lions share of the funding has been coming through foreign investment mostly venture capital or private equity funds We have taken some steps in the past to facilitate fund raising by startups but we will remain alive towards their evolving needs including easing the compliance burden 18 What should our approach be as far as capital outflows are concerned So far it has been almost entirely for direct investment Moreover there is no differentiated policy for equity and debt outflows The policy perspective forged during the FERA days had many negative vibes Why should a capital deficit countries export capital Shouldnt overseas investment be considered on the basis of the returns it generates Perhaps a time has come to take relook at it Creation of overseas assets by resident Indians goes as a credit entry in the international investment position Therefore rather than looking at dividend earning there is a need to look at value enhancement Secondly acquisition of strategic and economic assets eg coalfields oilfields etc is a longterm priority Thirdly overseas investment can perhaps be seen as export not of capital but of entrepreneurship Lastly overseas investment is also an important phenomenon associated with startups Several startups including individual entrepreneurs invest in India through a holding company overseas primarily because of the ease of raising capital in a foreign jurisdiction whereas the economic activity is located in India generating employment revenue and economic value We along with the GoI shall take a relook at any misgivings about regulatory regime in this regard and take necessary corrective action 19 Now I come to the foreign exchange markets I am aware that treasury professionals dealing with the forex market constitute a large part of this gathering and this is a theme with which you are closely involved As I mentioned earlier an orderly forex market is an important objective and also a precondition driving the evolution of the exchange management regime We have come a long way from the days of RBIs middle rate Today the Indian forex market is pretty well developed in terms of daily turnover as well as the range of products available Yet it continues to be a regulated market and let us now turn to the motivation for and the future of the regulatory regime 20 The forex market determines the exchange rate an important macrovariable with implications for balance of payments monetary policy capital flows and several other derived issues Now it is well known that in the long run the exchange rate depends on economic fundamentals like inflation interest rates balance of payment position etc but in the short run there can be significant deviations in the exchange rate from the value dictated by the fundamentals Though the exchange rate can be measured in several ways such as REER NEER with different combinations of currencies and different weighing schemes my discussion will be centred around the headline INRUSD rate which drives sentiments and decisions The fluctuations in the exchange rate are caused by sentiments and perceptions of a host of events some domestic and some global As you dealers say Buy the rumour Sell the news We have had many such episodes During the last one year or so the Rupee saw levels of 64 to a dollar in March 2018 depreciated to near75 levels in October 2018 and again appreciated to 68 levels by March 2019 and has been trading almost flat since then During this one year there has not been any change in the fundamentals of the Indian economy nor any dramatic change in the global conditions either The cause mostly has been surge or ebb in capital flows driven by perceptions and risk aversion or appetite However understanding these gyrations in the exchange rate does not provide any solace to the policy maker there is a response necessary lest the expectation turn to panic and bring a great deal of disorderliness in the market in its wake The first line of defence is market interventions But then the impossible trinity comes into play the interventions affect the rupee liquidity and may lead to a conflict with the monetary policy stance Sterilisation carries a cost And sometimes particularly when the Rupee depreciates there is a limitation to the extent of intervention rendering intervention strategically ineffective The second line of defence is resorting to modulating the capital control regime diluting or strengthening restrictions depending on whether the Rupee is appreciating or depreciating This must be a last resort though because while the forex market conditions can quickly reverse the control regime must have a longer lifetime lest decision making by economic agents is adversely affected 21 The second theme I want to talk about relates to derivatives in the forex market Derivatives evoke extreme reaction from the most significant event in finance Greenspan to weapons of mass destruction Buffet or license to kill Soros The primary purpose of derivatives is to hedge against future uncertainties Thus they perform economically a hugely useful function in enabling agents to make better intertemporal decisions But on the other hand they can also be used as instruments of speculation and can obfuscate risk allocation As Garber notes The problems associated with rise of derivatives stem partly from the same source as the benefits the increased ability to separate and market risks means that some counterparties can assume riskier positions more readily than in the past The other part of the source of the problem with derivatives is that they can be incomprehensively complex making the risk implications opaque In our markets we have both linear forwards and futures as well as nonlinear options exchange traded as well as OTC varieties The latter is mostly plain vanilla For some time complex derivatives not involving Rupee were allowed but it led to assumption of risks not understood epitomised in the Rajashree Sugar case Another facet of the problem is unhedged exposure Hedging has a cost It is the price an agent pays to convert an uncertainty to a certainty Thus there may be a tendency to remain unhedged and leave events in the lap of gods Should the market conditions turn hostile there is a mad scramble to cut loss which exacerbates the market further Our approach has been and will continue to be to provide an agent who has exposure to the Rupee resident or nonresident with a range of derivative products to enable them to hedge their foreign exchange risks but expanding the range of products has to be gradual 22 The discussion of foreign exchange market will not be complete without the issue of Internationalisation of the Rupee A currency is international or a reserve currency when it is held widely by nonresidents and used to settle international transactions Internationalisation of a currency has certain advantages and disadvantages as well The main advantage lies in getting rid of the original sin of inability to borrow in ones own currency which is at the root of currency crises The disadvantage comes from the obligation of a country whose currency serves as global reserve currency to supply it to meet the global demand which may come to conflict with its domestic policies Over the years global investors have shown increasing interest in Rupee denominated assets both equity and debt traded in onshore markets Rupee denominated bonds the socalled masala bonds have also found investor appetite in offshore markets When Rupee assets are widely held by global investors there will be need for rupee derivatives to hedge currency interest rate and credit risks It is therefore natural that there will be a need for such markets in offshore financial centres The challenge that these markets pose is that while the onshore derivatives market is tightly regulated offshore markets are beyond regulatory reach which can lead to domestic market being affected through arbitrage during turbulent episodes The regulatory framework will continue to strive to make the onshore derivative markets accessible to all nonresidents with a Rupee exposure 23 Let me now conclude India is among the worlds fastest growing countries and is the worlds third largest economy today in PPP terms It is among the global investors preferred destination The Indian economy has also shown remarkable resilience against adverse global developments if not completely decoupled from it With increasing sustained economic growth and macroeconomic stability favourable demography and a large market India is an important player in the global economic arena The sustainability of its global role will depend on the sustainability of the growth momentum and stability While this would require continuing policy response to emerging challenges in many spheres integration with global economy will be an important factor in sustaining the growth momentum We have to be alive to the challenges of both growth and stability and steer the policy regime relating to cross border transactions in tandem with the needs of the economy Foreign exchange dealers or rather authorised dealers in so far as they provide the primary interface with the customers and give shape to the developments in the forex market will continue to play an important role 24 I am sure your deliberations and discussions will be rich and fruitful I also wish you happy vistas of this ancient yet modern city 1 Maddison Angus The World Economy Historical Statistics 2003
https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1037&fn=5,Date Improving investor interest Recent Legislative and Regulatory Measures,With the transition to a marketbased system for determining the external value of the Indian rupee the foreign exchange market in India gained importance in the early reform period It is a well recognized fact that clear and efficient laws provide confidence to the investing community Such investments can be by domestic entities or foreign entities or investment overseas by domestic entities In the recent past India has embarked upon a number of legislative and regulatory measures that are certain to create a positive impact on the investment climate prevailing in the country and capable of boosting the confidence of investors A few such measures are also on the anvil I would like to invite the attention of the audience to a few of them Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 The recent enactment of a comprehensive legislation relating to insolvency of corporates firms and individuals has been a much awaited move The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 IBC lays down a resolution process that is time bound and undertaken by professionals It creates an institutional mechanism for insolvency resolution process for businesses operated by companies individuals or any other entities either by coming up with a viable survival mechanism or by ensuring their prompt liquidation The preamble to the Code makes clear the objective of the new law as one to consolidate and amend the laws relating to reorganisation and insolvency resolution of corporate persons partnership firms and individuals in a time bound manner for maximisation of value of assets of such persons to promote entrepreneurship availability of credit and balance the interests of all the stakeholders Through this enactment the Parliament has codified the laws governing insolvency and bankruptcy of both corporates and individuals which were spread over a number of legislations A key innovation of the new Code is its four pillars of institutional infrastructure comprising of Insolvency professionals Information Utilities Adjudicating Authorities NCLT DRT and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India The Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill 2016 Draft The IBC 2016 about which I spoke so far does not provide for resolution of the corporates providing financial services The need for jurisdictions having a specialized resolution regime applicable to financial service providers has also been recognized internationally Recently a draft Bill for this purpose has been recommended by a working group constituted by the Central Government This Bill aims to establish a framework to carry out the resolution of certain categories of financial service providers in distress to provide deposit insurance to consumers of certain categories of financial services and for designation of Systemically Important Financial Institutions by the Central Government for resolution The draft Bill on Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance not only consolidates the resolution provisions presently scattered in different statutes but also introduces new requirements like classification of financial service providers into various categories of risk to viability submission of resolution restoration plans etc and new methods for resolution on the lines of prevalent international practices It also proposes creation of a new specialized authority called the Resolution Corporation which will be tasked with the responsibility of carrying out speedy and efficient resolution of financial service providers The authority will also take over the deposit insurance activity presently undertaken by the DICGC The overall mechanism contemplated under the Bill would certainly bring in more clarity as to the rights of investors in the event of resolution of the investee financial service provider and is expected to improve investor confidence in the Indian financial market Amendments to the SARFAESI Act and DRT Act Slow pace of recovery of financial debts has been imposing considerable strain on the financial position of the lenders thus raising concerns for any investor existing or prospective of such lenders Specialized laws establishing Debt Recovery Tribunals DRTs and empowering secured creditors to enforce security interest without the intervention of court have been in vogue for several years now While such mechanisms have definitely facilitated faster recovery there can be no doubt that much more needs to be done In this context some of the changes made to those laws recently are worth mentioning For instance certain procedural improvements have been made with respect to the functioning of DRTs like i stricter time lines for filing of written statement conclusion of hearings etc to expedite adjudication ii filing of recovery application documents and written statements in electronic form and iii uniform procedure for conduct of proceedings Further specific provisions have been enacted in those laws to clarify regarding the priority of secured creditors over state dues Another important change brought about is enabling Debenture trustees to approach DRTs to recover unpaid debts due under listed debt securities as well as to invoke the provisions of SARFAESI Act to enforce the security interest without the intervention of courts These measures confer additional recovery avenues for the benefit of debenture holders Other Legislative Changes Legislative changes have also attempted to improve the investment horizon in asset reconstruction companies ARCs The restriction which existed on a holding company sponsoring an ARC has since been removed The sponsors of ARCs are now required to be only fit and proper as per RBI guidelines Further apart from qualified buyers non institutional investors specified by RBI could also invest in security receipts issued by ARCs Apart from the above there were a number of legislative measures of substantial significance to the investor community For instance a Constitutional amendment was brought in the previous year for enabling a single Goods and Service Tax throughout the country In the year 2015 Parliament passed the Arbitration and Conciliation Amendment Act providing for various changes to the arbitration laws with a view to making arbitration quicker reducing interference by courts and to make India a more attractive destination for foreign investors In order to take forward and accelerate the agenda of the Ease of Doing Business and Make in India the Commercial Courts Commercial Division and Commercial Appellate Division of the High Courts Act 2015 was promulgated which provides for the constitution of Commercial Courts and the establishment of Commercial Divisions and Commercial Appellate Divisions in the High Courts to adjudicate Commercial Disputes for achieving the motive of swift and speedy enforcement of contracts recovery of monetary claims and compensation for damages suffered to increase investment and economic activity in our country Other two notable legislative measures important from an investment perspective are Benami Transaction Prohibition Amendment Act 2016 and Real Estate Regulation and Development Act 2016 The Benami Transaction Prohibition Amendment Act 2016 aims to control the menace of black money and its byproduct Benami transactions with the new stringent law and its effective implementation The Real Estate Regulation and Development Act 2016 RERA is designed to provide uniform regulation protect consumer interests help speedy adjudication of disputes improve accountability of developers and boost transparency It should help to make the Indian real estate sector more attractive for foreign and domestic investment Foreign Investment Now let me discuss some of the recent regulatory measures relating to foreign investment In todays world no country can be an island oblivious of the developments in the world around it With globalization and trade reforms countries are globally integrated and have trade linkages with each other Free trade enables lower prices for consumers increased exports benefits from economies of scale and a greater choice of goods In developing nations including India free trade has increased the gap of Current Account Deficits as imports exceed exports To bridge this deficit and also to bridge the gap between domestic savings and investments India requires forex flows from overseas These flows help India reach its economic potential by providing capital to finance new industries and enhance existing industries boosting infrastructure productivity and employment opportunities in the process In other words they aid development and fuel domestic growth Inward flows can be in the form of debt equity deposits or personal remittances India continues to be among the top ten countries in terms of foreign direct investment FDI inflows globally and the fourth in developing Asia as per the World Investment Report 2016 by the United Nations Conference for Trade and Development UNCTAD India also jumped 16 notches again to 39 among 144 countries in the World Economic Forums Global Competitiveness Index 2016 that ranks countries on the basis of parameters such as institutions macroeconomic environment education market size and infrastructure among others External Commercial Borrowings ECB Considering the macroeconomic developments and the experience gained in administering ECBs over the years a liberalized regime for debt capital was introduced through a four track approach for ECBs The overarching principles of the revised framework are a fewer restrictions on enduses and higher all in cost ceilings b expand the list of eligible lenders to include long term lenders like sovereign wealth funds insurance companies and pension funds c small negative list of end use restrictions d nudge borrowers towards rupee denominated debt and e permit higher interest for long term foreign currency borrowings Recognizing the needs of the infrastructure sector long term borrowing in foreign currency denominated ECB with a minimum average maturity of ten years has been permitted subsequently reduced to five years in alignment with OECD requirements Access to alternative sources of credit to eligible borrowers without its concomitant forex risks was made feasible with the introduction of masala bonds Foreign Direct Investment FDI Foreign investment is one area which economies around the world look at with at most precision Which sectors to open up to foreign funds how much control to cede to foreign investors and what all clearances to mandate are some questions that pose challenges to most Governments In India the policy on foreign investment is framed by the Central Government On an annual basis it issues a consolidated circular detailing the policy stance The sectoral limits approval routes and investment linked conditionalities are laid down in the policy stance It also issues Press Notes as and when changes in the policy are proposed Regulations are issued under the Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999 FEMA to give a legal backing to these policies Investment can be received in the form of equity shares compulsorily convertible preference shares CCPS and compulsorily convertible debentures CCDs These instruments can contain an optionality clause subject to a minimum lockin period of one year but without any option or right to exit at an assured price The inflows on account of foreign investment was US 36485 billion in the financial year 201516 In the recent past regulations on investments have been liberalized to ensure increased flows Following the revisions in the foreign direct investment FDI policy announced by the Government the regulations have been amended so that wherever sectoral limits caps on foreign investment are in place such limits caps are required to be reckoned within a composite manner aggregating both Foreign Direct Investment FDI and Foreign Portfolio Investment FPI In addition control and ownership have been defined for the purpose of arriving at the indirect foreign investment in an Indian company and guidelines have been issued for calculating the total foreign investment to be taken as the sum total of direct and indirect foreign investments Regulations have also been amended to simplify FDI linked conditionalities increase sectoral caps and include certain sectors under automatic route This liberalization had a positive impact on sectors viz manufacturing insurance railway construction defence plantation real estate business ecommerce in single brand retail etc In addition foreign investment in limited liability partnership LLP has been permitted under the automatic route for sectors where 100 per cent FDI is allowed without attendant FDIlinked performance conditionality Ease of Doing Business Several steps have been initiated for facilitating the ease of doing business and contributing to an ecosystem that is conducive to the growth of startups Accordingly a dedicated mailbox was set up to provide assistance and guidance to the startup sector Further online submission of Form A2 for outward remittances has been enabled Certain transactions related to startups which were clarified notified are as under i issue of shares without cash payment through sweat equity was permitted provided that the scheme has been drawn either in terms of regulations issued by SEBI or the Government ii issue of shares against legitimate payment owed by the investee company remittance of which does not require permission of the Government or the Reserve Bank was permitted iii startup enterprises were permitted to collect payments on behalf of their subsidiaries abroad iv companies have been permitted to have an escrow arrangement or paying the consideration on a deferred basis for an amount up to 25 per cent of the total consideration for a period not exceeding 18 months in respect of transfer of shares between a resident and nonresident v startup companies were allowed to issue innovative FDI instruments like convertible notes and vi startups were permitted to access rupee loans under ECB framework with relaxations in respect of eligible lender enduse and cost of borrowing etc The move towards automation and use of technology for reporting and monitoring has been extended to Foreign Inward Investment and all FDI related returns have been replaced with online filing on the Governments eBiz portal NonResident Indians Deposits NRI Deposits India has always been a favored investment destination for its diaspora The flows in the form of deposits FCNRB and NRE has been steady in the recent years As on Dec 2016 the outstanding FCNR B NRE and NRO deposits were US 20859 US 77418 and US 11458 billion respectively Flows in respect of personal remittances were US 44083 billion and US 37656 billion in the last two financial years To further facilitate the account holders policies were changed to permit transfer across nonresident ordinary rupee NRO accounts Further NRIs and persons of Indian origin PIOs have been permitted to open NRO accounts jointly with other NRIs PIOs While permitting remittances outside the country from the balances held in NRO accounts maintained by NRIs and PIOs ADs are now required to obtain a declaration that the remittances represent the account holders legitimate receivables in India and do not represent any borrowing from any other person or transfer from any other NRO account Nonresidents having a business interest in India can open a repatriable special nonresident rupee SNRR account with balances commensurate with business operations An Indian company receiving foreign investment under the FDI route has been permitted to open and maintain a foreign currency account with an AD in India provided it has impending foreign currency expenditure The account needs to be closed immediately after the requirements are completed or within six months from the date of opening of such account whichever is earlier Overseas Investment Indias external sector management has gained strength over the last few years with a prudent and pragmatic approach to policy aimed at supporting Indias inherently strong macroeconomic fundamentals which has made India as one of the most attractive destination for foreign investors At the same time the growth in magnitude and spread in terms of geography nature and types of business activities of overseas direct investment ODI from India reflect the increasing appetite and capacity of Indian business sector in availing the opportunities thrown up by the rapid globalization The robustness of direct investment flows both inward as well as outward serve as an indicator of the maturity and degree of integration of India in the global economy While the average of total Financial Commitments FC under ODI for 201415 and 201516 at around US 30 billion was lower than the average of preceding two years US 40 billion the outlook and potential for growth in outward FDI from India remain positive as seen by encouraging trend in proposals Actual outflows which are asynchronous with the Financial Commitment have also varied over the period Overseas investment provides an important gateway for domestic businesses to enter the global marketplace and in recent times India has taken some significant steps to make its presence felt in the global arena The increased ODI have also resulted into greater macroeconomic cooperation between India and other countries transfer of technology and skill sharing of RD and promotion of brand India At the same time the increasing degree of uncertainty in a continuously changing and in recent times often a disruptively changing global business environment also poses some challenges for Indian businesses with respect to their ODI The policy and regulatory approach has been to balance the need to pave the way for growth of Indian businesses to keep pace with the changing demands of businesses and improve the ease of doing business for Indian companies with the need for managing the potential systemic risks within the confines of the broad policy based on a calibrated approach to the management of capital account While the FEMA notification on outward FDI regulates all acquisition of overseas securities denominated in foreign currency the focus is primarily to regulate acquisition incorporation of overseas entities by the Indian corporates The broad approach has been to facilitate outward foreign direct investment by domestic companies through joint ventures and wholly owned subsidiaries up to 400 of their net worth restrictions apply only in respect of investments abroad in real estate and banking Investment which is also termed as financial commitment can be in form of equity loan guarantee and raising funds through pledge of shares domestic and overseas assets Further resident individuals are enabled to undertake outward FDI within LRS limit of US 250000 Current issues During last one decade or so crossborder businesses involving multilayered structure of entities have been a common phenomenon Such layered structure of entities may be a plain vanilla twotier structure or a complex multilayered structure Further some of the business models resulting in inward FDI through the overseas entities established under ODI are posing major policy challenges including those pertaining to possible tax evasion money laundering and round tripping The World Investment Report of United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD has observed that tax avoidance practices by Multinational Enterprises MNEs are a global issue relevant to all countries Such structures are created typically based on either for transfer pricing reasons or for financing their subsidiaries While these could be established for tax avoidance purposes such structures often involve investments in offshore investment hubs as holding entities through which further investments are made in the step down subsidiaries Needless to say that even though the motivations range from genuine business commercial considerations to taxation benefits which are available to any global investors at times the underlying motive could be to create opacity through a labyrinth of structures for reasons unjustified which evokes concerns Treaty shopping and parking of capital and passive incomes in tax havens leads to erosion of the tax base of the countries Concerns have been raised about the minimization of tax burden by MNEs using legal arbitrage opportunities that arise out of gaps and frictions in the interactions of various domestic laws and or tax treaties The international community has taken note of abusive tax practices employed by tax payers to create double nontaxation or taxation at low rates Base Erosion and Profit Shifting BEPS have often been used as a tax avoidance strategy used by MNEs for shifting profits from high tax jurisdiction to low tax jurisdiction While efforts are on to further rationalize and simplify the extant regulations for undertaking ODI it would achieve a meaningful impact after the aforementioned issues are resolved effectively Conclusion To conclude India with its strong and modern legislative structure effective legal systems sound macroeconomic policies adherence to responsible fiscal management low and declining Current Account Deficit stable monetary and financial sector management robust economic growth prospects remains an attractive proposition for FDI India has also found its own niche in ODI The policy environment is alive to the potential growth in investments whether domestic foreign or overseas and remains ready to make adjustments Keynote address delivered by Shri R Gandhi Deputy Governor on March 2 2017 at the AsiaPacific Regional Meeting 2017 jointly organised by Link Legal India Law Services and Globalaw at Hotel Trident Nariman Point Mumbai Assistance provided by Shri A

the external value of the Indian rupee the foreign exchange market in India gained importance in the early reform period Shri C Venkat Nageshwar Chairman Foreign Exchange Dealers Association of India FEDAI Shri Ravi Sinha Acting Consul General of India in Hong Kong Shri D G Patwardhan outgoing CEO of FEDAI Shri Ashwani Sindhwani incoming CEO of FEDAI distinguished speakers and panellists and delegates to the Conference It is a great pleasure to be here today in this modern city of Hong Kong which Wikipedia describes as worlds most competitive economy the worlds most visited city and among the worlds most significant financial centres with a very high financial development index My sincere thanks to the FEDAI for inviting me to inaugurate their 11th Annual Convention These Annual events of FEDAI have been quite well known in recent times for the wide participation of the foreign exchange market participants for the depth and detail of the deliberations and of course for the idyllic locations chosen I am sure that this Convention too would excel its predecessors in all aspects 2 FEDAI was formed in 1958 when Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 1947 was in force and life was rather simple The BrettonWoods arrangement was in force there was a fixed exchange rate regime with Rupee pegged to the pound sterling and tranquillity reigned in the markets such as there were Mandate of FEDAI was simple too setting the basic rules for interbank and customer transactions pertaining to computation of rates and settlements Forex market and FEDAI have traversed a long way since then in keeping with the momentous changes that have taken place in financial markets in general and forex market in particular globally as well as in India Though not formally designated as a SelfRegulatory Organisation SRO it has effectively played such a role and the smooth transition and transformation experienced by the Indian foreign exchange market over the years can be ascribed to FEDAI in no small measure I am sure FEDAI will continue to play such a role in future with greater lan 3 In modern times the economic and market conditions have been evolving rapidly and whenever we find ourselves in the cusp of transformational events there is a global dimension involved Today the Indian economy is reported to be more integrated with the rest of the world than US and China in the sense that tradeGDP ratio for India at 496 per cent is higher than that for China 412 per cent and US 30 per cent If we also look at a wider parameter of Global Connectedness Index developed by Pankaj Ghemawat and Steven A Altman Indias score and rank is pretty high eg in 2013 our rank at 71 was ahead of China at 84 in a universe of 140 countries The quest for mobilising resources for Indias vast investment needs also has a pronounced outwardlooking refrain As we engage more and more with the rest of the world the cross border transactions not only increase in magnitude but also become more complex Even as we grapple with issues such as how to improve the ease of doing business to attract foreign investment and how to contain the potential instability due to increased cross border engagements the critical factor that influences our thinking and policy setting is the conditions in the foreign exchange market In this backdrop I shall discuss today a few select themes relating to foreign exchange market and cross border transactions keeping in view the broad topics of this conference allowing freedom in foreign exchange markets and internationalization of Indian Rupee Foreign Exchange Market Freedom with Stability 4 The modern foreign exchange market as we know it evolved after the Bretton Woods system broke down in early 1970s and the global currencies became freely floating It may be recalled that in the Bretton Woods regime the currencies were almost fixed visavis US dollar and the exchange rate carried within a narrow band US dollar in turn was linked to gold with a guarantee of the US monetary authorities When the US Government withdrew this guarantee on August 15 1971 the currency market went into turmoil and a floating rate regime came into existence Floating rate regimes were experienced earlier for example during the 30s when the markets were volatile and disorderly in the extreme and were shut down for extended periods It may be of some passing interest to note that Reserve Bank of India Act1934 was framed during this period and the preamble said And whereas in the present disorganisation of the monetary systems of the world it is not possible to determine what will be suitable as a permanent basis for the Indian monetary system 5 The floating exchange rate regime that came into existence in early 70s has remained in force for four and half decades It is not that there has not been occasions of disorderliness and turbulence in the market but the regime has not been over turned 6 Three interrelated factors have contributed to the evolution of foreign exchange market as we see it now First there has been tremendous improvement in global communication infrastructure gone are the days when trading and settlement used to be done over telegraphic systems hence the term cable rate The modern communication network has reached the time and space gap and the only limitation now is the diurnal motion of the earth Secondly this period also coincided with quantum advancement in computing capacity This has helped in improving the communication network But more importantly it has made trading and settlement quite easier It is possible for the trader as well as the back office to instantaneously understand the implication of a trade The ultimate culmination of this is of course algorithm trading Thirdly along with the development in computation sophisticated mathematical models have evolved to engineer complex and bespoke financial products A combination of these three factors has brought about a foreign exchange market that is truly global liquid and large 7 Notwithstanding the complexity and sophistication of the foreign exchange market the fundamental principle remains simple yet profound The foreign exchange market deals with currencies and a foreign currency is but a commodity visavis the domestic currency The price is the exchange rate Any price has two determinants The supply factor and the demand factor The first can be seen to be derived from the cost of production and the second from the factors that affect demand utility for instance In the foreign exchange market the first factor which ultimately determines the exchange rate in the long run is the purchasing power parity or the inflation differential The second factor that causes exchange rate movement in the short run is the expected earnings from exchange rate dynamics In the simplest of cases it is derived from interest rate differential but in the real world the exchange rate demonstrates random walk and behaves like any other financial asset It will be important here to remember that both the factors play equally important role in determination of the price To quote Alfred Marshall We might as reasonably dispute whether it is the upper or the lower blade of a pair of scissors that cuts a piece of paper as whether value is governed by utility or cost of production It is true that when one blade is held still and the cutting is effected by moving the other we may say with careless brevity that the cutting is done by the second but the statement is not strictly accurate and is to be excused only so long as it claims to be merely a popular and not a strictly scientific account of what happens Marshall 1890 1997 290 8 The exchange rate is a key macroeconomic variable It shapes a countrys balance of payments and engagement with the rest of the world It affects a countrys export competiveness of course in conjunction with other factors and its income and employment to the extent that export sector is important for the economy It determines the cost of import and to the extent that import constitutes articles essential for investment and growth can act as a retarding factor It affects the price level through the linkages provided by the tradeable sector 9 As we have seen earlier foreign currency behaves like a financial asset The prices of all financial assets are forward looking and are based on the expectation of the future state of the world As such a country can face large capital inflows or outflows depending on whether its future is perceived to be promising or discouraging This in turn can affect the exchange rate which may not be in consonance with the fundamentals of the real economy for example the appreciation of the Rupee in 200708 was caused by large capital inflows attracted by a buoyant and promising economy but affected the export sector adversely The reverse was perhaps the case in the East Asian crisis The capital flows also pose challenge for the monetary policy setting I allude to the much discussed MundellFleming trilemma ie it is impossible to have an open capital account independent monetary policy and fixed exchange rate Capital account openness and independent monetary policy framework could lead to flexible exchange rate which can be disorderly and volatile 10 The reason I am discussing these issues in some detail is to emphasise the criticality of the exchange rate The importance of exchange rate cannot be over emphasised for developing countries For instance it has got special importance for India like unemployment for Americans and inflation for Germans The memory of the 60s and 70s when the critical shortage of foreign exchange reserves forced us to resort to the PL 480 for meeting the food requirement of the country are pretty strong Exchange rate movement either way can affect us adversely Appreciation could hurt our exports and depreciation would make the imports expensive Given that our large part of imports comprises crude fertilizer capital goods and intermediates increase in the cost of imports due to depreciation of currency can hurt our growth and employment and affect the fiscal balance 11 In this backdrop there are two questions that need to be posed First how to ensure that the exchange rate remains stable and as is stated in the preamble to FEMA 1999 how to preserve orderliness in the foreign exchange market Second the exchange rate will be stable and not fixed and therefore there will be some volatility in the foreign exchange market Therefore how to enable those affected by the exchange rate to cope with the risk inherent in a volatile market 12 I will deal with the second problem first As long as the inflation differential between India and the other countries remain positive the Indian currency will exhibit depreciation over the long term However in a world dominated by capital flows there can be significant deviations from the longterm path indicated by the Real Effective Exchange Rate REER REER itself one should note is a function of several dynamic factors and variables and hence may not serve as very accurate anchor as the base period loses its relevance in the face of more recent developments Even in the case of US dollar the deviation from the long term represented by the REER is known to have been of the order of 80 per cent Such volatility affects the earnings and balance sheet of all firms that have contracted or even economic exposures The approach to resolve this problem is to provide a deep and liquid foreign exchange derivatives market to enable market participants to hedge their foreign exchange risk I have spoken about the derivatives market in detail elsewhere and do not wish to deal with it in detail here2 The most straightforward derivatives are the forward contracts or their exchange traded counterpart the currency futures where the payoffs are simple and linear While the pricing of these derivatives are fairly simple based on the interest rate differentials the use of these products by the market participants is mostly motivated by their expectations of the future spot rate Ordinarily if you have a foreign exchange receivable or payable and if you have entered into a forward sale or buy contract your exposure is evened out and you should not be bothered about what happens to the exchange rate However the concept of marktomarket is not only in the books of accounts but also in the peoples minds Not unexpectedly a cloth manufacturer and exporter decides her hedging strategy based on her own view of the expected future spot price as different from the forward price and of course often based on advice of experts As I have mentioned earlier the foreign exchange rate exhibits random walk in the short run and the best prediction of tomorrows rate is todays rate About expert advices I can only paraphrase Samuelsons famous words To prove that Wall Street is an early omen of movements still to come in GNP commentators quote economic studies alleging that market downturns predicted four out of the last five recessions That is an understatement Wall Street indexes predicted nine out of the last five recessions And its mistakes were beauties 3 Now after havingbooked a forward contract one tracks the path of the spot rate and starts revelling or repenting about the imagined gains or losses 13 The other way of hedging risk is by using nonlinear derivative options Once nonlinearity is brought into hedging strategy the universe becomes virtually unlimited Any combination of linear derivatives will still have linear payoffs But combination of nonlinear derivatives with themselves or with linear derivatives can result in payoffs of varying complexity Such complex products along with a future that is shrouded in ignorance can have pretty unpleasant outcomes and sometimes even threaten market stability 14 In this backdrop we have adopted a gradualist approach in respect of regulation and expansion of forex derivatives market keeping in view certain uncertainties we have witnessed in the global and local level macroeconomic environment On the one hand we are committed to enable any entity whether resident or nonresident with an exposure to the exchange rate of Rupee to hedge it using onshore derivatives and on the other we have been circumspect about introducing new products such as complex options including the socalled exotics for reasons no other than the misuse of the products either not matching with ones risk or even for buying risk with a speculative strategy As I see it the universe of permitted derivatives will expand and even undertaking a derivative transaction will become simpler All this however depends on how stable the currency markets remain and how responsibly the market participants behave I hardly need to stress that in all financial transactions in general and derivative transactions in particular the principle caveat venditor applies just as strongly as the principle caveat emptor Regulating CrossBorder Transactions Responsibility Responsiveness 15 Now I come to the first question I had posed earlier that is how to ensure stability of the exchange rate The obvious response that springs to ones mind is intervention by the central bank Intervention however is to be used only in extreme situations and cannot be a part of the policy framework Intervention has got costs and other implications like negative carry of the foreign exchange reserves interference with the monetary policy framework cost of sterilization of intervention operations etc depending upon whether intervention consist of buying or selling foreign exchange The strategy therefore seems to be a combination of some capital controls and flexible exchange rate Earlier this year the Bank of Japan Governor Kuroda was reported to have advised China to impose capital controls to defend the yuan rather than keep burning through currency reserves 4 The role of capital controls rather active capital account management in preserving stability in the external sector and foreign exchange market has now been well recognised in the aftermath of the global financial crisis Some studies have shown that capital controls measures for capital account management are desirable in certain circumstances even when the exchange rate is flexible Here I can cite the examples of how we have been calibrating the outflows permitted under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme LRS and the inflows under the External Commercial Borrowings ECB framework in the Indian context 16 During the FERA regime there was complete exchange control Not only capital account even current account transactions were also subject to control measures During the acute foreign exchange crisis the capital accounts were opened up slightly for the expatriate nonresident Indians by way of incentivised accounts access to the secondary market in equities etc Since the liberalisation process started in the early 1990s the capital account has been progressively liberalised We were courageous enough to think of full capital account convertibility on two occasions in 1997 and in 2007 Unfortunately because of unfolding of global macroeconomic developments the implementation of the path to full capital account convertibility remained on the drawing board stage Our commitment to progressive liberalisation of the capital account has of course remained steadfast through the problems ranging from the postPokhran II global reactions to the recent global financial crisis 17 What has been our approach to management of capital account One way of looking at the issue is to see how it affects three different segments of the economy the nonfinancial firms and businesses the individuals and the financial firms As far as the first segment is concerned a more open capital account provides better access to resources and investible funds brings in better technology and management practices and improves their valuation Right since the first days of opening up of capital account the emphasis has been to ensure that the real sector is not deprived of the benefits of an open capital account We can say that in effect the capital account is fully open for most of the real business sector The restrictions are in respect of individuals and the financial sector In a resource starved country enabling individuals particularly those with high networth to transfer their wealth to foreign places is surely a low priority policy objective As far as the financial sector is concerned the restrictions stem from the premise that it is this segment which creates systemic vulnerabilities in an open economy 18 There is another way of classifying capital flows viz by the asset class equity debt and immovable property The distinction between equity and debt is too well known The two financial contracts have their own structures and implications From the limited perspective of external sector stability suffice it to say that while a capital inflow in the nature of equity poses little stability issues except in socially or economically sensitive sectors where foreign ownership may not be considered appropriate debt contracts can lead to build up of significant risks at the firm and more importantly at the systemic level History stands witness to this proposition Whether it is Latin America or East Asian countries or Greece in recent times financial and economic stability were rooted in borrowing a foreign currency or in a currency over which the country had no control 19 The regime for foreign debt is dictated by the concern for excessive indebtedness in foreign currency which can sow the seeds of instability Take the example of the ECB the regime as is in force today The prudential focus of the current ECB framework is to provide a nudge towards long term borrowing to mitigate rollover risk andor borrowing in Rupees so that currency risk is not borne by the borrowers discouraging borrowing by those who do not have any natural hedge by way of foreign currency earnings or earnings linked to the exchange rate allincostceiling to prevent poor quality borrowers from accessing risky foreign currency loans and encouraging borrowings from longterm lendersinvestors like sovereign wealth funds insurance companies and pension funds 20 Here I would like to mention two interrelated issues in the passing Often we hear mention of foreign currency borrowings as a source of cheap funds Is it really cheap In a perfect market with no capital account restrictions there should not be any opportunity for arbitrage between a fully hedged foreign currency borrowing and a Rupee borrowing on the one hand and when the borrowing is longterm with coupons and repayments spread over the lifetime of the borrowing and between the cost of hedging and the long term average rate of depreciation on the other Thus as far as the cash flows are concerned it would not matter whether an Indian firm avails of foreign currency borrowing or Rupee borrowing The arbitrage opportunities that exist are due to market imperfections and barrier to arbitrage But whether foreign currency borrowing is truly cheaper requires deeper study with longterm data The second issue relates to whether foreign currency borrowings should be hedged It is intuitive to expect that those whose revenues are neither in foreign currency nor are indexed to the exchange rate should not leave the currency mismatch unhedged Although it may be argued that the cost of hedging is often more than the rate of long term depreciation of the Rupee it is worth asking the question whether one can trust ones instinct to remain unhedged hoping and betting that one would be able to ride on the best part of the exchange rate cycle or protect oneself against possible adversities in line with a prudential risk management framework This choice has to be very carefully evaluated 21 Coming back to the issue of other asset class of equity it needs to be noted that the regime for foreign investment in equity is pretty permissive be it as foreign direct investment or foreign portfolio investment As far as I can see the only two high level restrictions i in a few sectors where the extent of foreign investment is capped due to their sensitive nature and ii in the stipulation that the issue or transfer of securities should be at fair value But as always the devil often is in the detail Obviously the investment should be in equity securities Some leeway is provided through hybrid securities fully and compulsorily convertible preference shares and debentures The other hybrid securities such as partially convertible debentures optionally convertible debentures or equities with embedded optionality are not treated at par with equities and hence not permitted as instruments for making foreign direct investment 22 Most of the details of the structures in the foreign direct investment regime comes from the concern to allay the appreciation that a FDI should not be used as a camouflage for debt But how complex does the structure become In a manner of speaking every investment is an act of speculation Every investor must have an expectation about future state of affairs and the cash flows or return that will accrue to him Every act of investment is subject to the usual information asymmetry Therefore every investment contract must provide for the probable states of affairs and how the investor will protect himself against the uncertainties and the information problems Straitjacketing investment contracts thus often results in disputes or worse much needed investment shying away from socially useful sectors Here I would like to refer to cases where hybrid instruments eg optionally convertible preference shares are issued with the option to exit linked to predetermined milestones This becomes imperative as investment strategy of many investors eg Private Equities is often different and there is need for a reasonable exit option under certain circumstances without any assured return 23 This problem is aggravated by the way the FEMA is structured Unlike in case of current account transactions where the principle is that everything that is not specifically forbidden is allowed in case of capital account transactions the principle is that only anything that is not allowed is forbidden This makes a great demand on the framers of regulations lest the investment and business is subject to the limitations of their perceptions The way business is done is forever evolving and it is a difficult job for the regulators to keep pace with it There is a very good case for relooking at this principle and align the regulatory approaches for current and capital account transactions Even as we liberalise capital account more and more the universe of restrictions shrinks and the regulatory structure will be simpler if it mentions what is prohibited rather than what is allowed 24 As we move to more liberalisation and rationalization of regulations there have been some unsettling developments in the recent past Advance remittance for imports without any corresponding imports into India receipt of advances for exports without exports materialising for a long time and more recently the revelations of the so called Panama Papers In case of Panama Papers on the basis of reports it is suspected that some Indian individuals may have been involved in setting up of businesses maintaining balances abroad illegally Investigations are on and the situation can be assessed only on conclusion of the process when full details are available The question that troubles us is should the unfolding of these events influence our approach to regulating crossborder transactions 25 On this subject I cannot help recalling what the Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha said in the Lok Sabha on November 19 1999 while replying to a debate on the Foreign Exchange Management Bill I quote What we are trying to do through this legislation is to bring the entire management of foreign exchange in line with the changes which have taken place as a result of liberalization on current account I strongly refute with all the emphasis at my command that this piece of legislation is going to help the blackmarketeers the black money operators or the hawala operators This is a figment of the imagination of a section of the Members of this House and I refute it as I said with all the emphasis at my command This is in terms of meeting a new situation which has come about as a result of liberalization of the foreign exchange management and the Act will only facilitate that management That is the reason why we are introducing this legislation We have already introduced the Prevention of Money Laundering Bill The two legislations I will suggest should be considered together because they cover the entire gamut of the issues that are involved in these two pieces of legislation 26 Often what comes across as contraventions of FEMA indeed are issues related to tax evasion or money laundering I wonder if it would not be more appropriate to deal with these wrongs within the framework of tax and money laundering laws It is nobodys case that these wrong doers should go unpunished indeed the punishment should be swift and exemplary What I am emphasizing is that this should not colour our perception in respect of cross border transactions and mould our regulatory approach in a regressive fall back to the FERA mindset After all countries with no foreign exchange laws do have such wrongs and do effectively deal with them There is a case for avoiding any possible attempts for regression into FERA regime This will of course be helped by Authorised Dealers in foreign exchange collecting collating and sharing the information so as to ensure that the regulatory intent is not compromised in letter and spirit 27 Just a word in passing on the internationalisation of the Rupee in recognition of the fact that this is one of the themes of this Conference today This has been an exciting topic of discussion amongst the academia and market participants in recent times In the annual conference of FEDAI held in Zurich in 2012 5 I had alluded to this aspect in some detail keeping in view the seven prerequisites for moving towards internationalization of a currency as laid down by Peter Kennen The issues relating to pace and sequence of internationalization in fact even its definition and desirability continue to be raised with a lot of passion I must mention that the Rupee was in a sense an international currency till the 60s and it was even a legal tender in parts of Africa and much of Gulf Those were the Bretton Woods days of fixed exchange rate and the Rupee was linked to the Sterling After a quarter century of near autarchy in currency the 90s saw a flexible exchange rate regime complete convertibility on the current account and gradual opening up of the capital account Today Indian holding of global assets including the official reserves and the global holding of Indian assets are very large India has tremendous growth prospects and even in these days of tardy growth around the globe the Indian growth story continues to be a beacon of light The world obviously wants to have a share of this pie and Indian assets continue to be valued and attractive But with this will come the exposure to the volatility of Indian Rupee and the need for hedging the risk The NDF market came into existence to address this need and no wonder continues to thrive The correct approach to address this problem is not to engage in an ad hominem tirade against the NDF market and its participants but to address the genuine need by increasing the access to domestic onshore market to all those who have a legitimate Rupee exposure Several steps have been taken in this direction and more are in the offing 28 In a sense internationalisation of Rupee is rather a process than an event The pace of the process depends upon how fast the capital account opens up which in turn depends upon the evolving macroeconomic conditions and the financial stability concerns Rupee cannot be an international currency by issue of a fiat Pound Sterling in its time or US Dollar today achieved the status of the leading international currency of the day because the inherent strength of their economies and their financial markets and not by any administrative proclamation The conditions necessary for greater internationalization of Indian Rupee in terms of its acceptability in trade and other crossborder transactions as a reserve currency and reaching much higher level of capital account convertibility will be ensuring the macroeconomic stability and having a deep and liquid financial market In the interim the measures taken and planned for using Indian Rupee in trade denomination and settlement particularly with our neighbouring countries where intraregional trade volumes are very low should be taken forward And also the facilities for onshore hedging of all nonresident entities for their increasing capital account exposure including offshore Rupee bonds issued by multilateral institutions and Indian corporates should be eased further Concluding thoughts 29 As I prepare to hang my boots after a long campaign various shades of feelings and emotions flash across my mind I have had an almost four decade long association with the countrys central bank and with its financial system This is a pretty long period in the modern times Around the time I joined the Reserve Bank momentous things were happening around the globe The Bretton Woods System had broken down so had the Smithsonian Agreement Following the Jamaica Agreement of Jan 1976 the flexible exchange rate regime had been officially endorsed The European Exchange Rate Mechanism was being conceived and would be introduced in 1979 to culminate in a single currency two decades later 30 Closer home though the draconian legislations FERA enacted in 1973 and COFEPOSA in 1974 were at their prohibitive peak we had begun to emerge from the dark ages The Green Revolution had taken roots mitigating the pressure on our BoP for importing foodgrains and the remittances from the expatriates were buoyant Both put together had eased our external sector management Since then despite ups and downs we have grown in strength in the management of our external sector which in turn has catalysed our quest for growth and development Though much remains to be done the achievements are not to be scoffed at To mention just one statistic the life expectancy at birth was 41 years in 1960 54 years in 1978 and has gone up to almost 70 years at the latest count 31 A vibrant financial sector is an inevitable part of a developed modern society In due process of development of the financial sector it culminates in seamless integration with the rest of the world In the meantime it is the responsibility of the regulators to steer the process in a nondisruptive and facilitative manner I hope that we have achieved that to a large extent and I personally feel happy and proud to have played some part in that process We are now ready for transiting to a more developed economy and advanced society As the Prime Minister paraphrased Walt Whitman in his recent address to the US Congress The orchestra have sufficiently tuned their instruments the baton has given the signal and there is a new symphony in play I shall enjoy the music from my comfortable perch outside the burden of responsibility 32 I wish the convention all success and would like to convey my best wishes to all the participants for whatever endeavours they may choose to pursue Thank you all 1 Based on the inaugural address of Shri Harun R Khan Deputy Governor Reserve Bank of India at the 11th Annual Conference

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=995&fn=5,Date Global Economic Turmoil Impact on Indian Economy and the Way Forward,With the transition to a marketbased system for determining the external value of the Indian rupee the foreign exchange market in India gained importance in the early reform period It is a pleasure to be here amongst the captains of Indian Industries who drive Indias growth amidst global uncertainty and economic slowdown I thank the organisers for allowing me to share my thoughts on a topic which is quite relevant in the current context 2 While preparing myself for todays discussion I was not very sure whether the current global economic situation warrants the characterisation as turmoil Turmoil is defined as a state of great disturbance confusion or uncertainty While there is a high degree of disturbance confusion and uncertainty and some would like to characterise the current situation as a newer version of VUCA volatility uncertainty complexity and ambiguity I would still be hesitant to use the word turmoil to describe the prevailing market conditions I intend to highlight some features of the evolving global economic scenario I would then touch upon its impact on the Indian economy and what could be the way forward Global scenario 3 More than eight years have passed since the onset of the Global Financial Crisis GFC in 2007 Yet the world economy is not out of the woods yet Central banks of Europe UK and Japan continue to remain in an accommodative mode a clear indication that growth and inflation have not recovered to a sustainable level Charts 1 2 The US economy has been doing well enough in growth terms for the Federal Reserve to begin in December 2015 the process of normalising policy rates that had been hugging the zero lower bound since late 2008 The fragility of their economic outlook was however clearly revealed in the reversal of the impact of liftoff in less than a month as China started showing signs of weakening Inflation outlook in all these countries continue to be soft which has been dampening hopes of a sustained recovery In the US in particular the softness in wages despite the unemployment rate edging below five per cent does not auger well for the inflation outlook This together with fragility of the global economic conditions and the strengthening of the US dollar are the reasons the market seems to be sceptical of pace of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in the near future 4 Fears of further weakening of the Chinese economy its falling equity market and the depreciation of its currency loom large over global economic prospects In January capital outflows from China triggered selloffs across both Advanced Economies AEs and Emerging Market Developing Economies EMDEs exacerbating currency declines and heightening volatilities Crude oil prices fell to multiyear lows to below US 30 per barrel The riskoff sentiment was reflected in the sharp surge in the prices of gold and the US treasuries and in the unwinding of carry trades undertaken with Euro and Japanese Yen as funding currencies leading to their unexpected strengthening Markets have somewhat settled down since then but the threat of renewed volatility is ever present 5 Apart from uncertain recovery prospects in the AEs the major reason behind such turbulence is the real prospect of a China slowdown Global economic performance post GFC has been largely supported by Chinese growth and demand particularly for commodities oil industrial metals etc needed to support the huge infrastructure buildup During the period 20052014 Chinas share in world GDP has increased from two per cent to around 12 per cent The massive liquidity pumped into the global system as the consequence of the easy monetary policies pursued by the AEs viz US Europe Japan UK managed to find assets in which it could be invested be it emerging market assets or commodities In fact commodity prices managed to stay well supported after their post2008 crash until they started to unwind from mid2014 Chart 3 6 There are now indications that Chinas efforts at rebalancing its economy are facing serious challenges at least in the near term Prolonged slowdown in developed economies is increasingly making it improbable that even a big economy like China will be able to create the level of demand lost by the advanced economies for much longer China generated demand as it went on a colossal spree to build infrastructure In the process the economy might have created large overcapacity not just in infrastructure but also in the manufacturing sector In fact China is said to be now taking steps to cut down excess capacities in sectors like steel and coal mining over the next few years The scope for further activity in this sector therefore looks diminished at this juncture Simultaneously the financial health of banks and local bodies which had funded this huge expenditure is being called into question 7 These factors have led to an outflow of capital from China particularly in the last one year Chinas forex reserves have come down from US 39 trillion to US 32 trillion The Chinese currency has been under increasing pressure The stock markets have sold off and lost nearly 50 per cent of their value since mid2015 The prospect of effectively containing the pressures of a more open capital account also looks uncertain The slowdown in China has also led to a sharp correction in commodity prices which in turn had major consequences as under Economic performance of commodity exporting economies Australia Canada Brazil Russia etc has taken a beating and this has added to the weakening global growth outlook Money has started to move out of risky assets equity commodity etc to safe haven assets eg Government bonds in US UK Eurocore and Japan and safe haven currencies eg US dollar Euro and Japanese Yen The high risk segment of the financial sector viz hedge funds private equity etc has already been suffering over 2015 But lately the health of banks especially the ones who have had large exposure to commodities including energy sector has also been called into question Top banks in Europe have seen their stock prices falling sharply and their CDS premia go to near crisislevels Banks in UK US Australia Japan are all to a lesser extent similarly affected The financial sector is thus again under pressure The emerging market currencies Chart 4 and equities have come under pressure Some of the EMDE commodity exporting countries have however seen their currencies recouping a part of the losses during last few days on the back of recovery in international crude and commodity prices 8 To sum up global economic growth has slowed down but has not really reversed the direction The International Monetary Fund IMF in its January 2016 World Economic outlook has projected global growth at 34 per cent in 2016 marginally going up to 36 per cent in 2017 helped largely by EMDEs projected to grow at 43 per cent and 47 per cent respectively Fears of a 2008 like crisis may still be a long way off unless things get a lot worse in China Being an optimist I would be hesitant in using the word turmoil to describe the current global economic situation There are certain concerns though The risk of a deflationary spiral looks more immediate and has the potential to cause damage With some sovereign and corporate balance sheets sitting highly leveraged a deflationary period and the increase in the real value of debt could weaken the debt repayment capacity of many economies and corporations Persistent low interest rates which cast a shadow on the capabilities of central banks to stimulate growth and stability make the outlook on global financial markets highly uncertain Critical issues relating to global geopolitical developments and idiosyncratic sociopolitical challenges being faced by many advanced economies would have a spillover impact on the economic outlook and have to be kept in view Of course this would require separate discussions Impact on India 9 Let me now briefly discuss about Indias positioning visvis its peers in the EMDE space at the current juncture While I share with you some facts and figures which are quite impressive I would also flag certain issues which if not addressed properly could be a drag on the economy India has been variously hailed as beacon of stability haven of stability and bright spot amidst a slowing global economy This flows from the fact that India is the best performing large economy GDP close to US two trillion with a 76 per cent estimated growth rate for FY16 Both IMF and the World Bank in their January 2016 outlook project India to grow at the highest rate among major economies in 2016 and 2017 Notwithstanding the volatility seen in some of the vital data points eg falling exports low IIP numbers etc the growth trajectory remains on track Importantly such growth has been accompanied by macroeconomic stability Inflation has been under control and the balance of payment position looks healthy Current Account Deficit CAD has narrowed to 14 per cent of GDP Q2 FY16 from the high of 48 per cent in FY13 Capital flows have remained strong during the last few years as can be seen from the data given in table 1 Indias foreign exchange reserves stand at a robust level of about US 350 billion The ratio of shortterm debt to foreign exchange reserves remains around 250 per cent As illustrated in the Economic Survey 20162 India has made significant progress in reducing its macrovulnerability as gauged by an overall index of macroeconomic vulnerability based on fiscal deficit current account deficit and inflation According to the Survey India which was most vulnerable among the major EMDEs in 2012 has sharply reduced its vulnerabilities Since 2013 Indias index has gone up to 53 per cent compared to say that of 07 per cent of China and 04 per cent for many other EMDEs which are in the BBB category of rating In Global Competitiveness Index India has also moved up 16 places from 71 to 55 in 2015 This index is based on 12 pillars such as macroeconomic environment institutions infrastructure innovations market size health education etc The Survey also suggests that India compares favourably to its peers in its credit rating universe when it comes to Indias attractiveness to investors based on macroeconomic stability and growth rate This is captured in the Rational Investor Rating Index RIRI 10 On the flip side like most other EM currencies Rupee did come under pressure and so was the stock market Over a longer time horizon say the last five quarters Rupee has however shown more resilience as compared to its peers reflecting the improving macroeconomic fundamentals of the country 11 Another area that has been affected by global weakness is the exports sector Indias exports have been in contraction mode for fourteen successive months although there are indications of a sequential bottoming out While the CAD has improved the external sector has been contracting Though Indias foreign exchange reserves are at almost record high levels the external sector vulnerabilities have not completely disappeared Indias external debt has increased from US 4460 billion as at endMarch 2014 to US 4832 billion as at Septemberend 2015 Foreign exchange reserves provide 725 per cent cover to external debt though visvis some of its EM peers India is better placed as can be seen in Table 2 below Way Forward 12 The interlinkage of Indian economy with the rest of the world has been growing at a rapid pace and therefore global developments influence the domestic economy in a much bigger way than before Though the spill over effect can take place through multiple channels it mostly gets transmitted through the commerce or trade channel through the capital flows channel and through the confidence channel 13 As stated earlier the falling exports for a prolonged period is an issue that needs serious attention What is worrying is the fact that our market shares have fallen from 17 in 2011 per cent to 16 per cent in 2015 The falling crude prices may have helped the country to bring down the current account deficit but once oil prices start recovering the challenge before the country would be to increase exports if the CAD has to be contained on a sustainable basis A recent IMF working paper3 on Price and Income Elasticity of Indian Exports has concluded that Indian goods exports are sensitive to external demand and to international relative pricecompetitiveness Manufacturing sector exports are estimated to be more price elastic and sensitive to global demand developments in the shortterm Services exports are also not exhibiting buoyant trends with the market share falling from 32 per cent in 201112 to 31 per cent in 201314 The prospects of a sluggish global economic recovery may pose challenges for India to achieve significant export growth acceleration in the coming years whereas supplyside constraints could dampen the price responsiveness in the shortterm In the backdrop of uncertain global demand the challenge for the country would be to search for new markets and new products for existing markets besides addressing the issues relating to competitiveness of Indian exports 14 As we have seen in the past capital flows are usually susceptible to periodic phases of sudden stops andor reversals which can put downward pressure on Rupee Despite Indias relatively stronger fundamentals the confidence or contagion effect of a global safe haven move could have its impact on the Rupee Here the importance of attracting stable flows like FDI needs to be highlighted As shown in Table 1 the policy adjustments and improved macroeconomic environment have helped us to attract more FDI flows this year than the last year As hitherto Government and Reserve Bank would of course continue to be on constant vigil and be ready to take proactive measures in respect of the evolving situation in the external sector 15 Macroeconomic stability is important to contain contagion effects arising out of the confidence channel Government has shown its firm commitment for fiscal consolidation The Economic Survey 2016 has brought out that India taxes and spends less than OECD countries and even its emerging market peers After adjusting for the level of economic development and democracy Indias taxGDP ratio is 54 per cent less than that of comparable countries while its expenditureGDP ratio lags by 64 per cent Nearly 85 per cent of the economy is outside the tax net While these developments may be explained by historical differences the need to catch up with EM peers and the OECD countries in the next few decades would be important in determining the extent and pace of Indias infrastructure development and by extension future economic development Therefore even as fiscal consolidation is on track in terms of GFDGDP target ratios there may well be a need to broaden the reach of fiscal reform by setting a targeted path to increase both tax revenue and fiscal expenditure 16 Retail inflation in India as measured by CPI rose for the sixth straight month in January 2016 The CPI for January at 569 per cent was the highest figure recorded since August of 2014 Similarly food inflation at 685 per cent in January was also the highest in 17 months Despite these numbers we are on track as far as meeting the inflation targets is concerned in near term4 There are however risks to meeting our projections Besides structural factors like persistent high level of food prices due to rising income level not being matched by increase in productivity production and distribution of food items in particular proteinpulses food the implementation of the seventh Central Pay Commission award monsoon and the path of commodity prices including crude prices have to be factored in the near term inflation outlook 17 There have been discussions in recent times about the stress in banking and corporate balance sheets In respect of health of Indian banks the Reserve Bank has taken various steps to address the issue of stressed assets of the banks After a comprehensive asset quality review banks have initiated the process of cleaning up balance sheets by March 2017 While this may lead to a shortterm impact on profitability of some of the PSU banks it would enable a healthy flow of credit to the system in the long run Further efforts at improving the capital buffers of banks will be helpful as they prepare to lend more now after cleaning up their balance sheets Also the steps being taken to improve governance in banks such as the setting up of a Banks Board Bureau BBB would complement these efforts to develop and strengthen the banking sector In respect of corporate sector stress as evident from profitability and lower interest coverage ratio the efforts at deleveraging including by way of exit from noncore business enhanced productivity and additional equity infusion and better governance practices supported by policies aimed at containing the global headwinds have to be fasttracked 18 A deep vibrant and welldeveloped financial market is needed to facilitate efficient resource allocation risk dispersion and credit intermediation Government Reserve Bank and other regulators have been constantly engaged in taking measures that would help in developing markets During the last few years Reserve Bank has taken various measures including introduction of currency futures and options interest rate futures which would add to the menu of already existing over the counter instruments for managing the currency and interest rate risks Further in order to give a fillip to the development of term repo market Reserve Bank allowed rerepoing of securities acquired under market repo These products if used judiciously would facilitate corporates to manage their risk exposure efficiently 19 Underscoring the importance of a vibrant corporate bond market that could help the country in meeting the large scale infrastructure financing Reserve Bank has allowed repo in corporate bonds as well as selling and buying of single name Credit Default Swaps There is also a proposal to introduce electronic trading platform for corporate bonds in India I would however like to add here that we have not seen a wide range of players participating in recently launched productsbe it in the area of currency derivatives or interest rate derivatives Government is initiating the process of legislation for lender protection that would incentivise flow of debt funds to corporates The Government has announced a slew of proposals in the Union Budget for 201617 that would give a fillip to the corporate bond market in India These include expanding the investment basket for foreign portfolio investors to include unlisted debt securities and pass through securities issued by securitisation and introduction of electronic auction platform for primary debt Early passage of the Bankruptcy Code will greatly facilitate the development of corporate debt market Reserve Bank in collaboration with the Government and other regulators will continue with its efforts in bringing about reforms in the financial sector 20 While domestic policies that reinforce the macroeconomic fundamentals help us to cope with external vulnerabilities given our increasing level of international linkages we cannot be immune to spillback effects of action or inaction of other countries particularly arising from surges in inflows or sudden substantial outflows This calls for regional and global safety nets in terms of multilateral institutional mechanisms for funding support It is also imperative that institutional mechanisms eg the International Monetary Fund should exist at the global level to assess the policies of large economies from the point of their contagion impact on other countries particularly EMDEs and advise them to factor such consequences in their policy framework India will have to work vigorously to buildup global consensus in this area In Conclusion 21 As I said in the beginning I do not take a very pessimistic view of the current global situation and would prefer not to call it turmoil I would rather consider the current situation as a great opportunity for India to position itself as a leader who would shape the world economic order in years to come There would be challenges nevertheless The real challenge would be to sustain the improved fundamentals over a longer period and contain the spill over effect from other parts of the world While other countries may take measures best suited to them our focus should continue to remain on improving domestic macroeconomic fundamentals including addressing the infrastructure bottlenecks ensuring price stability narrowing current account deficit continuing fiscal reforms increasing the competitiveness of our products and services for the global market and improved governance I have no doubt that the steps taken by the Government including those aimed at ease of doing business in India and regulatory measures initiated by the Reserve Bank and other regulators would give enormous confidence to local foreign investors our trade partners rating agencies and the large community of nonresident Indians Simultaneously we have to work to build international consensus on policy coordination among advanced and emerging economies for minimising the spillover and spillback impacts of the policies of the former on the latter 22 Thank you all for your attention 1 Address of Shri Harun R Khan Deputy Governor Reserve Bank

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=953&fn=5,Date Musings of a Departing Forex Market Regulator,With the transition to a marketbased system for determining the external value of the Indian rupee the foreign exchange market in India gained importance in the early reform period Mr Gupta Chairman FEDAI Mr Vohra Mr Banerjee Vice Chairmen Mr Patwardhan CEO my banker friends colleagues from the RBI ladies and gentlemen 1 It gives me great pleasure to be here with you this morning The Foreign Exchange Dealers Association of India has been choosing exciting overseas locations for its annual conventions these days and this beautiful city with its long history and increasing preeminence in European and international affairs is indeed a fine choice The Indian engagement in the neighbourhood diamond centre of Antwerp has been growing over the years and today Antwerp has perhaps the highest concentration of branches of Indian banks outside a global financial centre I am sure the aura of Brussels will provide a stimulating backdrop for the deliberations 2 Mulling over what I should be discussing this morning I remembered the lines from Lewis Carrolls immortal Through the Looking Glass The time has come the Walrus said To talk of many things Of shoesand shipsand sealingwax Of cabbagesand kings And why the sea is boiling hot And whether pigs have wings 3 As some of you may be aware my association with Reserve Bank comes to an end in less than two months from today as I demit office on the last day of May this year Although my threeandahalfdecade long association with Reserve Bank spans a wide range of functions I shall always value and cherish my engagement with the foreign exchange control and later foreign exchange management functions for many reasons the most important of which is the quantum and exciting changes in this area to which I was a ringside spectator and in which I too played a small role As practitioners you will appreciate that the regulatory framework for management of the external sector is a workinprogress and it will traverse many a winding path before it is entrusted entirely to market forces The destination is well known but how and when we reach there remains hazy even today It is tempting to look back at how we reached here if for no other reason than in the hope that it would perhaps guide us in our unfinished journey and help us to chart our future course of action That is what I intend to do and I am sure you will indulge me if sometimes my discussion is peppered with personal reminiscences Foreign exchange Control to management 4 Where do we begin A good place probably would be at the very beginning when the exchange control itself started In 1939 the then British Government imposed exchange control as a part of their war effort with a view to directing foreign exchange to nationally important objectives Later after the war was over it was put on a statutory footing with legislation in 1947 It is instructive to note that the 1939 order and the 1947 legislation were put in place in the United Kingdom as well and it will not be until 1979 that Britain removed all exchange controls albeit lock stock and barrel overnight by the inimitable Margaret Thatcher It is also interesting to remember that pegged to the pound sterling the Indian Rupee was the legal tender in a large part of the Commonwealth particularly in the Gulf and the Africas during the 1950s and 1960s 5 The seeds for a rigid exchange control the shadow of which falls even today were sown in the fifties During the second five year plan the emphasis of central planning shifted to heavy industries and there was an unintended neglect of agriculture This and three wars in a span of a decade created an acute shortage of foreign exchange reserves the intensely of which was painfully felt because we needed foreign exchange to import basic food grains In this background conserving foreign exchange was considered a national priority and using this precious resource for mundane purposes was blasphemous It is necessary to understand the traumas of those days to appreciate how a framework wrought by FERA 1973 could come into being Though situation improved following the success of seedwaterfertilizer technology in agriculture and the inward remittances from Indian brain and brawn the exchange control regime meandered through the eighties with a relaxation here and a finetuning there It took another crisis in 1990 to cause a paradigm shift in our approach 6 What was the foreign exchange market like those days The market participants today would hardly see any similarity between the market today and the market then There are many reasons for the primitive nature of the market in the decades preceding the 1990s Firstly the markets globally were characterised by the post Bretton Woods tranquillity of a fixed exchange rate regime Though the Breton Woods arrangement broke down in the early 1970s we in India continued with a variant of fixedexchange rate regime for two more decades Secondly the external sector engagement was tradedominated International capital flows were rather thin The licensepermit regime made foreign exchange transactions rather straightforward in the sense that every transaction had to be backed by a license or a permit Thirdly the technology was pretty primitive It is hardly believable today that when the Rupee was devalued on June 6 1966 the forex markets were shut down for two days so that banks and firms could recalculate the impact 7 Talking about the devaluation of 1966 brings to my mind an observation which though a digression is too important to pass You see we have had two devaluations the one I spoke about just now by a massive 574 and then again in 1991 when within a year the Rupee had dropped by 59 On both occasions the devaluations were sharply criticised The arguments spanned the entire spectrum from surrendering Indian sovereignty to external pressure to textured cynicism as to why devaluation will not be effective in narrowing the trade deficit because of the structural inflexibilities of the Indian exports and imports Yet statistics shows that on both occasions the impact of the devaluation on trade deficit was phenomenal The point that I wish you to ponder over is that devaluation or depreciation in a flexible exchange rate regime may be bad politics but often is good economics The reason I ascribe great importance to this is that our approach to greater capital account openness in large measure will be tempered by our tolerance of exchange rate volatility and particularly weakening of the Rupee 8 Even in a rather passive and archaic market those days the banks showed great hesitation in participation Till 1950s only foreign banks were allowed to undertake foreign exchange transactions With the gradual entry of Indian banks the FEDAI was formed in 1956 basically to evolve uniform practices for interbank transactions as well as banks transactions with the public Its functions have also evolved over the years and I would particularly like to mention the role it played countrywide during the transition phases involving both fixed to floating rates and from FERA to FEMA in facilitating the change It played an important role as an educator as well as normsetter In mentioning this I am anticipating the far greater role from a self regulatory perspective that awaits it in the time to come 9 Now we come to the momentous changes that the 1990s decade brought about The events leading to the onset of economic reforms and the course and content of the reforms have been commented upon extensively and it has been so deeply accepted and absorbed in our collective discourse that any discussion is superfluous What made the change possible We can take a cue from the words of Victor Hugo that Dr Manmohan Singh quoted in his first budget speech no power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come Dr Singh had applied these words to the vision of emergence of India as an economic power To me these words apply with as much aptness to the concept of free markets In a recent speech Governor Rajan has eloquently dealt with the issue and I will strongly urge the audience to reflect on his discussion as well as the works he bases his discussion on The reforms in the 1990s in India and elsewhere were facilitated by the dismantling of the Soviet Russia and the Eastern Bloc countries and triumph of the free market over central planning and control 10 A critical component of the reform process was introduction of flexible exchange rate It started with exchange rate adjustments in July 1991 continued with the introduction of Liberalised Exchange Rate Management System in March 1992 and by March 1993 we had put in place a completely market determined exchange rate system This was a critical step indeed I still recall the trepidation that prevailed when RBI took this step which involved the central bank stopping the announcement of buying and selling rate every morning Everyone waited with bated breath as to how market will open on day one It did and the rest as they say is history As I mentioned earlier the move did have a salutary effect on the trade deficit and by 1994 the trade deficit had shrunk to onesixth of what it was in 1991 More importantly it paved the way for greater openness not only in the current account which was achieved as early as 1994 but also in the capital account by removing one of the three constraints of the impossible trinity the fixed exchange rate 11 Once the flexible exchange rate regime was put in place the next step was the development of the forex market It was not smooth in the beginning The market participants were as hesitant as a bird that had been released from its cage after an age and often reluctant in offering two way quotes Besides they also probably did not have as much regulatory freedom as a marketmaker would require In 1994 an Expert Group Sodhani Committee went into this issue in great depth and detail and came out with a large number of recommendations a majority of which was implemented Implementation of these recommendations gave the banks as well as business firms a great deal of freedom to conduct their forex business in an efficient and costeffective manner The ones that were not considered immediately have either been implemented over the years eg forex clearing offshore banking units etc or have become superfluous eg authorised dealer license to DFIs 12 The two decades of flexible exchange rate regime has been marked by several episodes of disturbances emanating from external sources The Asian crisis of 1997 the postPokhran II sanctions the unprecedented capital inflows of 200708 the post Lehman seizure of 2009 the EuroZone crisis the US debt problem and the so called taperfear have all affected the exchange rate and elicited amongst others response that constrained the market and market participants at least temporarily You will also notice that we are relatively more affected by external turbulence nowadays as compared to the past which is quite intuitive in view of the increasing openness of our external sector in trade as well as financial channels The future course of market development has to recognise this fact and develop an immune system as it were to deal with the onslaught and the fortitude not to fall off the cliff every time there is heightened volatility in the exchange rate Some reflections 13 The foreign exchange market today is fairly well developed The liquidity as gauged in terms of turnover and bidask spread is quite impressive There is a wide range of products available for firms engaged in international trade and commerce to hedge their foreign currency risks There is both an OTC as well an exchangetraded segment But I do not intend here to patronisingly pat ourselves on what we have achieved in developing the market but rather reflect on what we havent and what lies ahead 14 As we have seen earlier free market process is the best way of organising economic activity Why then should this principle not extend to the foreign exchange markets and why should there be any regulation at all It is well known that markets have limits and there are market failures I am not talking about the moral limits of markets but limits coming from factors such an monopoly or noncompetitive markets externality information asymmetry etc And then there are financial and macroeconomic stability issues which have come to the fore post the turbulence of past seveneight years Foreign exchange has of late come to emerge as an asset class by itself It is common today to see currencies being described as best performing underperforming etc There are currency trading desks with performance assessment strategies and so on Several banks and other financial institutions have brochures promoting investment in currencies as an asset class Not only are currencies seen as assets but as a Financial Times caption once brought out it is an asset class that thrives on volatility Currencies as assets generate a dynamics of their own Currency flows are no longer adjunct to trade and investment they exist for their own sake But it has to be appreciated that currencies as assets like fire cannot exist on their own just as fire needs a fuel currencies require other assets classes bank deposits bills notes or bonds and so on and thus impact other markets as well 15 Most of the regulatory constraint in the Indian forex markets relate to the foreign exchange derivatives both in terms of who can participate and what are the conditions for participation Derivatives essentially facilitate intertemporal transfer of demand and supply and therefore serve to express future expectations or views as traders call it Moreover the views can be expressed rather cheaply inasmuch as one does not have to finance a speculative inventory This in conjunction with what I have discussed a little earlier brings us to the inference that an unrestricted currency market can lead to volatility in exchange rate as well as currency inflows and outflows 16 The question that then arises is this If we are to allow unfettered currency trading are we prepared for the consequences The first of these is volatility in the currency The exchange rate is an important macroeconomic variable that impacts a countrys trade and investment directly and the entire macroeconomic condition indirectly I do not intend to venture into the debatable territory of the magnitude direction and exact nature of the impact of exchange rate movements notice the debate on the impacts of a weak Euro or a strong Dollar But that there is an impact is undeniable Equally important is the impact on the sentiments which often drive reactions in the public the press and even among those who are supposed to know better 17 This brings us to the other impact that is on the monetary management of the economy The MundellFleming Trilemma is well known If with an open capital account which is what a free foreign exchange market shall mean you intend to interfere with the market determined exchange rate you will have to sacrifice your freedom to set the interest rate Obviously this is not a viable choice So what is a workable compromise Some restriction on capital account which translates to the restrictions on the foreign exchange market seems the easiest of choices which several countries including India adopted 18 Let me now come to the derivatives in the Indian forex market As I mentioned there are three sets of restrictions on products on participants and on participation Let me comment on these aspects in reverse order The access to the derivative markets is basically available for hedging All economic agents residents or nonresidents who have an exposure arising out of any permitted transaction have access to the derivative market both OTC as well as exchange traded on the strength of such underlying exposure Over the years we have made this operationally as easy as possible and continue to smoothen the creases We are aware of the expanding Rupee derivatives market necessarily cash settled in overseas locations and have been trying to provide easy access to the overseas entities that have a Rupee exposure to the entire derivative markets onshore Short of completely delinking the access to derivative markets from underlying exposure our efforts to facilitate operationally easy and economically efficient hedging shall continue 19 This brings me to the next question what derivative products are necessary to ensure efficient hedging Ordinarily as long as access is based on the principle I mentioned earlier there should not be any restriction on the products that participants can transact It is well known that a wider range of products helps market participants hedge their risk better The problem arises from the complexity of the products and the questions as to whether those who use them fully understand their risk consequence and whether the products are appropriate for their risk profile and risk appetite Memories of the Global Financial Crisis are too fresh to overemphasise this aspect Abuse of complex foreign exchange derivatives has happened in our markets as well and I am sure some of you present here will testify to this Before we proceed further in our efforts to enrich the derivative products allowed banks will have to put in place a framework for testing the appropriateness of the product used for their clients FEDAI has an important role to play in this The idea must be to prevent misselling rather than penalise such actions Recently it came as a great shock for me to learn that some of our exchanges do not have systems to upfront prevent self trades They rather believed in tracking and penalising self trades This to my mind is an inefficient approach to the issue At least in the markets that RBI regulates the principle shall be prevention is better than penalising Unfinished agenda 20 Let me now turn little futuristic What is that needs to be done in proximate future You may call it my perception of the unfinished agenda Firstly the scope of option products that market participants can contract needs to be expanded beyond the plain vanilla now available The motivation for this is that there is a growing concern these days about the risk of unhedged forex exposure in the books of corporates At a micro level individual entities may well be able to tide over any exchange rate stock but at a macro level when everybody scurries for cover the market impact may be unsettling Now what is the incentive for hedging We must consider the facts that roughly the Rupee has been depreciating at about 5 per year whereas the cost of a swap today is about 67 This surely acts as a disincentive There is a need to align individual incentives with that of the system Use of options and what is called option trading strategies can contribute in this and therefore the regime has to consider permitting this Two specific enablements that we are actively considering in this direction are permitting covered option writing and relaxing the net worth criteria for using option strategies to hedge exposures 21 Secondly the scope of participation based on economic rather than contractual hedging needs to be expanded Here we are on a more difficult territory With increased integration of the Indian economy with the rest of the world economic exposure affects virtually everybody in the tradable sectors and also outside Today even a banana grower from Nagercoil can complain that her business is affected by an appreciating Rupee To some extent this gets addressed by the nounderlyingrequiredhedging that has been enabled both on the OTC as well on the exchangetraded segments But there is also a need to take a relook at the issues and widen the scope of the present regime and perhaps bring clarity into it For instance can we think of permitting corporates to access forex markets upto a multiple of exposures to be contracted during any year without any documentation being insisted upon subject to necessary checks and balances to prevent outright punting Can we redefine exposure to mean net exposure ie net of payables and receivables for permitting outright purchase or sale with the temporal mismatches being managed through swaps I would invite extensive debate on these issues 22 Another issue that I would like to flag is the need to rethink on the entities to participate in the forex market Has the Indian forex market become a closed club where the behaviour of the market participants is getting too predictable Do we then allow new category of members as market makers for example the standalone primary dealers or select nonbank finance companies Are we prepared for an open minded debate 23 Now I come to the second theme of my discussion that is opening up of capital account Having declared complete openness on the current account as early as 1994 we thought that we can soon attain capital account convertibility as well There have been two attempts in the past at charting a path to reach full capital account convertibility in 1997 and again in 2007 The onset of the East Asian crisis of the late 1990s and the Global Financial Crisis relegated our plans to the back burner In the aftermath of the crisis capital account convertibility is no longer seen as a secular objective to be pursued and capital account restrictions are in certain situations seen to be important policy instruments to promote financial and macroeconomic stability Be that as it may in the current discourse we see opening up of the capital account as a process rather than as an event Further it is also recognised that unless capital account liberalisation is accompanied by achievement of certain thresholdsand financial and institutional developments the costs may far outweigh the benefits 24 Where do we stand in this regard For the real sector there is almost complete freedom as far as capital account transactions are concerned In foreign direct investment the restrictions mostly pertain to sectoral caps in a few sectors deriving more from strategic and social considerations rather than strictly economic ones Portfolio investment is almost completely open In fact the unrestricted access to foreign portfolio investors has brought great buoyancy to the equity markets but it also sometimes leads one to wonder whether we are selling our equities cheap Overseas investment by Indian enterprise is also fairly permissive As far as debt flows are concerned it is true that there are various restrictions both at the aggregate levels as well as at micro level While the regime for regulation of external debt has been progressively modified to cater to the emerging resource needs of the economy there are still issues on which a comprehensive view needs to be taken Let me elaborate 25 Regulatory regimes the world over frown upon debt inflows and time and again the external sector instability has been found to be rooted in indiscriminate borrowing In countries with relatively higher inflation and therefore higher interest rates foreign currency borrowing in lowinterest currencies appears attractive In ideal market conditions there should not be arbitrage opportunity between the costs of a hedged foreign currency borrowing and an onshore domestic currency borrowing But given the imperfections in Indian markets cost of the former is likely to exceed the latter The attractiveness of and rush for foreign currency borrowing therefore can be explained only by the inclination of borrowers to remain unhedged As I have mentioned earlier this surely raises systemic concerns 26 The regime for foreign currency borrowing so far has been anchored on three criteria the use the cost and the tenor of borrowing These are sound principles indeed There may be a case for doing away with the cost criterion since it is in a way superfluous in view of the other restrictions including a loosely monitored aggregate cap One view is that if it is mandated that all foreign currency borrowing should be necessarily hedged all restrictions can be dispensed with But then is mandatory hedging the most appropriate policy Given the already high cost of linear hedging products like forwards and swaps which will explode if all foreign currency borrowers seek mandated hedges there may not be any foreign currency borrowing at all And if hedging is to include options and optionbased structures how effective will the hedging be then given the borrowers incentive to minimise the cost of hedging These are questions that need to be reflected upon 27 When the regulatory regime for external debts was born we were all original sinners of contracting debt only in a foreign currency Of late given the fact that India is seen as a growth hub of the future the interest of foreign investors has turned to Rupee debts as well as evident from the recent interest shown in government and corporate bonds Further foreign investors are not shy of investing in rupee debts even in overseas locations as the experience of IFC and ADB issues last year show There is a need to appropriately incentivise the move away from foreign currency debts to Rupee debts even as the position in respect of overall indebtedness in prudentially managed We propose to pursue this matter further in a calibrated manner 28 Be it investment in equity or in debt there is a need for removing the small prints and elements of discretion in the regulatory regime As the Finance Minister observed in his budget speech Capital Account Controls is a policy rather than a regulatory matter It is therefore necessary to clearly enunciate the ingredients of the policy which apply secularly and uniformly to all so that the elements of regulation are known unambiguously to all I have spoken on this subject at length elsewhere and I do not wish to repeat them here 29 The case for a principle based regulation is founded on the fact that the ways of doing business are forever evolving and the ways of financing are evolving even faster This is quite evident in say infrastructure sector and the new technology start ups It is difficult for a rulebased regulatory framework to keep pace and consequently it is likely to handicap many socially useful projects Moreover in the process it is likely to be rendered a complex maze But a principle based regulatory framework has certain preconditions As Julia Black states PBR both formal and substantive and in both dyadic and polycentric relationships is predicated however on extensive trust between the actors in the regulatory regime2 If on the other hand the actors start playing games it leads to regulatory dialectics and an intrusive and regulatory regime Having said this let me state that we are almost at the end stage of rewriting FEMA regulations making them simpler and more principle based To conclude 30 Let me conclude As will be seen from the foregoing we have made considerable progress from where we were The fixed income markets have registered good growth In fact we have started seeing the growth in corporate bond outstanding starting to outpace the bank credit growth The forex market has also grown both onshore and offshore in keeping with increasing international engagement The growth of derivative market may not have been spectacular but the market has indeed expanded in terms of products In the hierarchy of priorities the foremost perhaps is the development of a bond market for its criticality of long term financing particularly for the infrastructure projects Notwithstanding the impressive growth over the last several years there is a need for faster growth in issuances increased liquidity in the secondary markets expansion in the rating span of bond issuances and so on The growth of this segment has been discussed a lot To my mind further vibrancy in this segment depends on growth in long term savings and directing the same to this segment in a framework of responsible and regulated portfolio management framework I believe the corpus generated by the NPS will provide the necessary nudge Directing of the foreign long term savings to domestic corporate bonds is attractive and indeed the gates have been opened fairly wide But at this stage how desirable is it to allow foreign investors total freedom to access the domestic debt that is protected against credit and foreign exchange risk Only for arbitraging on interest rates Further the Indian bond and currency markets are beset with many such structural frictions large government borrowings bank dominated financial intermediation capital controls etc In the face of this wisdom lies in proceeding with caution in a nondisruptive manner No doubt perfect and seamless integration of market segments and removal of riskless arbitrage opportunities through interlinkages or nexuses is an ideal objective but is constrained by concerns for stability in a setting of narrowing but still yawning gulf between the macroeconomic conditions of India and the financially developed capitalsurplus nations I am reminded of what Fisher Black is reported to have once remarked The markets look more rational from the banks of Charles than from the banks of Hudson 31 This brings me to my last and the most important point The role of Authorised Dealers and FEDAI in times to come The Authorised Dealers led a very protected life in the FERA regime and never had to apply their mind to the permissibility of a foreign exchange transaction because it had to be based on an RBI permit or some other permit for example an import license Today it is not so When FEDAI was formed in the 1950s its role mostly evolved round computation of various forex rates and mostly interbank transactions In the times to come both Authorised Dealers and FEDAI will have to play an active role in ensuring that customer transactions are compliant with the regulations The more we move towards a principle based framework the more arduous will be the responsibility of the Authorised Dealers This includes the issue of fair pricing as well Indeed our success in moving to a principle based framework will depend on the involvement of ADs You will have to gear up for that responsibility 32 Finally let me briefly recapitulate some of more important issues In foreign exchange market as in any other market freedom is the default and any restraint by way of regulation has to justify itself The regulation has to be based on sound economic principles and not on dogmas or evangelism Though the superiority of free markets as a way of organising economic activity is well recognised there are many areas where the limitations of market have been widely discussed in the literature and are well accepted There is no accepted standard for optimum regulation which is often idiosyncratic The regulation of forex markets has to be seen in that context As Chesterton remarked Dont ever take a fence down until you know the reason it was put up More products go towards market completion and enable better hedging against risks but are limited by the wisdom of the participants to use them Exact pace and content of capital account liberalisation will depend upon the future events but the regulatory regime has to be clear and transparent A regulatory regime that creates uncertainty and obfuscates imposes tremendous cost on the economy and the society Finally the issue of fair pricing Forex customers especially from small and medium enterprises and retail segments have approached us on several occasions highlighting high charges levied by Authorised Dealer banks on their forex transactions Not only there appears to be a wide variation amongst the banks in the charges levied on the smaller customers there appears to be a complete lack of transparency regarding the information on charges levied for such customers I am aware that FEDAI has issued a Special Circular in this regard but I once again urge all banks assembled here to pay due attention to this aspect before calls for regulation of forex rates become more vocal 33 I wish the conference whatever is left of it all success I also wish each one of you all success in the years to come As I leave the stage rather than singing along with Frost that we have miles to go before sleeping I would rather echo Tennysons brook read markets that will surge along irrespective of men like me or any other who may come and go I shall of course continue to watch the developments from the sidelines Good bye 1 Address by Shri G Padmanabhan Executive Director Reserve Bank of India at the Foreign Exchange

definition of current account in FEMA 1999 The AD bank may undertake the remittance transaction without RBIs permission for all residual current account transactions which are not prohibited restricted transactions under Schedule I II or III of FEM CAT Rules 2000 as amended or are defined in FEMA 1999 It is for the AD to satisfy themselves about the genuineness of the transaction as hitherto Q 4 Under LRS are resident individuals required to repatriate the income earned on investments abroad over and above the principal amount Ans The investor who has remitted funds under LRS can retain and reinvest the income earned from his investments made under the Scheme However the receivedrealisedunspentunused foreign exchange unless reinvested shall be repatriated and surrendered to an authorised person within a period of 180 days from the date of such receipt realisation purchase acquisition or date of return to India as the case may be Further any additional repatriation requirement with respect to investments made under Overseas Investments Rules and Regulations 2022 shall also be adhered to Q 5 Can remittances under the LRS facility be consolidated in respect of family members Ans Remittances under the facility can be consolidated in respect of family members subject to the individual family members complying with the terms and conditions of the Scheme However clubbing is not permitted by other family members for capital account transactions such as opening a bank account and investment if they are not the coownerscopartners of the investment

resident in India comply with the terms and conditions of the Scheme Q 6 Is the AD required to check permissibility of remittances based on nature of transaction or allow the same based on remitters declaration Ans AD will be guided by the nature of transaction as declared by the remitter in Form A2 and will thereafter certify that the remittance is in conformity with the instructions issued by

However the total amount of foreign exchange purchased from or remitted through all sources in India during a financial year should be within the cumulative limit of USD 250000 Once a remittance is made for an amount up to USD 250000 during the financial year a resident individual would not be eligible to make any further remittances under this scheme even if the proceeds of the investments have been brought back into the country Q 9 Resident individuals but not permanently resident in India can remit up to net salary after deduction of taxes However if he has exhausted the limit of USD 250000 as net salary remittance and desires to remit any other income under LRS is it permissible as the limit will be over and above USD 250000 Ans Resident individuals but not permanently resident

complied with while allowing the current account transactions Q 11 Are there any restrictions towards remittances to Mauritius and Pakistan for permissible current account transactions Ans No there are no restrictions towards remittances for current account transactions to Mauritius and Pakistan Remittances directly or indirectly to countries identified by the Financial Action Task Force FATF as non cooperative countries and territories from time to time and remittances directly or indirectly to those individuals and entities identified as posing significant risk of committing acts of terrorism as advised separately by the Reserve Bank to the banks are not permissible Q 12 What are the requirements to be complied with by the remitter Ans The individual will have to designate a branch of an AD through which all the capital account remittances under the Scheme will be made The applicants should have maintained the bank account with the bank for a minimum period of one year prior to the remittance For remittances pertaining to permissible capital account transactions if the applicant seeking to make the remittance is a new customer of the bank Authorised Dealers should carry out due diligence on the opening operation and maintenance of the account Further the AD should obtain bank statement for the previous year from the applicant to satisfy themselves regarding the source of funds If such a bank statement is not available copies of the latest Income Tax Assessment Order or Return filed by the applicant may be obtained He has to furnish Form A2 regarding the purpose of the remittance and declare that the funds belong to him and will not be used for purposes prohibited or regulated under the Scheme Q 13 Can remittances be made only in US Dollars Ans The remittances can be made in any freely convertible foreign currency Q 14 Are intermediaries expected to seek specific approval for making overseas investments available to clients Ans Banks including those not having operational presence in India are required to obtain prior approval from Reserve Bank for soliciting deposits for their foreignoverseas branches or for acting as agents for overseas mutual funds or any other foreign financial services company Q 15 Are there any restrictions on the kindquality of debt or equity instruments an individual can invest in Ans No ratings or guidelines have been prescribed under LRS of USD 250000 on the quality of the investment an individual can make However the individual investor is expected to exercise due diligence while taking a decision regarding the investments which he or she proposes to make and such investments shall be in accordance with Overseas Investment Rules and Regulations 2022 and the directions made thereunder Q 16 Whether credit facilities fund or nonfund based in Indian Rupees or foreign currency can be extended by AD banks to resident individuals Ans LRS does not envisage extension of fund and nonfund based

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/PublicationReportDetails.aspx?UrlPage=&ID=1000,Date,Preface Banks are permitted by Reserve Bank of India RBI to set up Automated Teller Machines ATMs as extended delivery channels In year 2012 RBI decided to permit nonbank entities ie White Label ATM Operators WLAOs to set up own and operate ATMs in India The investments in ATMs have been leveraged for delivery of a wide variety of banking services to customers across the banking industry and expanded the scope of banking to anytime anywhere banking through interoperable platforms provided by the authorised shared ATM Network Operators Card Payment Network Operators Usage of ATMs by the public has been growing significantly However from last 3 years new ATM deployments have been more or less stagnant due to ever increasing cost of operating ATMs and there have been no changes in ATM usage charges and interchange fee There is persistent demand from the stakeholders to review the ATM charges and interchange In order to address these it was announced in the Part B of the Second BiMonthly Monetary Policy for the year 201920 on June 6 2019 that RBI will constitute a Committee to Review the ATM Interchange Fee Structure with a view to give a fillip to the ATM deployment in the unbanked areas The Committee was constituted involving all stakeholders under the chairmanship of the Chief Executive Indian Banks Association IBA to examine the entire gamut of ATM charges and fees Composition and Terms of Reference of the committee is given in Appendix 1 The Committee met several times with the first meeting held on July 17 2019 Details of Committee meetings held are given in Appendix 2 Presentations and interactions were undertaken with different stakeholders ie Banks WLAOs and managed service operators Brown Label ATM operators Presentations were also made by RBI officials conveying the views of RBI on the recent guidelines on ATM related issues including the objectives security aspects cost assumptions etc The Committee thanks RBI officials for giving their time and valued inputs on recent guidelines issued on ATM security and control measures The Committee thereafter extensively deliberated all the issues around the cost of operating ATMs cost impact of recent regulatory guidelines for enhancing ATM security and control measures changes required in cash management and logistics interchange fees ATM usage charges etc and have framed the recommendations It is hoped that the Report will provide inputs for policymakers to address the concerns of banks and WLAOs in specific and the ATM industry in general It shall help them to consider the recommendations for reviewing the interchange fees and ATM usage charges which shall help in making ATM operations viable This would encourage banks and WLAOs to consider deploying more number of ATMs specifically in semiurban rural centers as penetration of digital transactions in semi urban and rural centers is expected to take more time Govt RBI had also set up a committee for Deepening of Digital Payments in the country for strengthening the digital payments The Committee acknowledges the time spent by Officials of Banks WLAOs and BLAOs for giving inputs and sharing their views in the said matter The Committee also acknowledges the time and efforts put in by the Officials of IBA Mr K Ramachandran Mr Vikas Srivastava Ms Radha Lakshmi S and NPCI Mr Abhay Parekh Mr Anand Iyer and their valuable contributions for assisting the Committee in completing the assignment 1 Executive Summary 11 ATM is an important channel for customers to access cash anytime and anywhere any ATM Ease and ability of withdrawing cash from bank accounts at the time and place of choice requirement gives confidence to the customer to keep money in the bank accounts thus increasing the money in circulation through formal banking channel The investments in ATMs have been leveraged for delivery of a wide variety of banking services to customers across the banking industry and expanded the scope of banking to anytime anywhere banking through interoperable platforms provided by the authorised shared ATM Network Operators Card Payment Network Operators 12 The usage of ATMs in India by the account holders has gone up considerably over the last decade and half However the ATM access in India lags most of the emerging markets and large economies like Russia Brazil China South Africa US UK etc with only 22 ATMs being available per 100000 adults in the year 2017 While the overall ATM access in India is low the ATMs are also unevenly deployed between rural and urban areas About 69 2011 census of population living in rural areas have only 47 of ATMs deployed in semiurban rural centers and rest being in metro urban centers Thus there is a huge requirement for ATM deployment in India to make it accessible to masses and make it even more available in semiurban rural centers where it is highly underserved 13 The recent regulatory guidelines have impacted the cost of operating ATMs significantly It is necessary to have safe and secure banking channels including ATMs being one of the main channels for cash transactions However Banks and WLAOs need to have a mechanism whereby the incremental cost incurred by them can be recovered over a period of time to ensure viability of operating of ATMs 14 Usage of ATMs by the public has been growing significantly However from last 3 years new ATM deployments have been more or less stagnant due to prohibitive costs of operating ATMs making them unviable There is persistent demand from the stakeholders to review the ATM charges and interchange 15 In order to address these RBI has constituted a Committee to Review the ATM Interchange Fee Structure involving all stakeholders under the chairmanship of the Chief Executive Indian Banks Association IBA to examine the entire gamut of ATM charges and fees 16 The Committee met on several occasions and had presentations interactions with different stakeholders ie RBI Banks WLAOs and managed service operators Brown Label ATM operators The Committee extensively deliberated all the issues around the cost of operating ATMs cost impact of recent regulatory guidelines for enhancing ATM security and control measures changes required in cash management and logistics interchange fees ATM usage charges etc and have framed the recommendations 17 There were multiple assumptions by different stakeholders while estimating the average cost of operating ATMs ie some included cost of security guard or esurveillance while some included certain other assumptions Average monthly cost of operating an ATM is estimated to be in the range of 75000 to 80000 per ATM excluding Cassette Swap The blended estimated cost financial and nonfinancial transactions both together in ratio of 7525 per transaction 120 average financial transactions per ATM per day comes in the range of 1560 to 1670 and 130 avgfintxns it comes in the range of 1450 to 1540 This is against the existing blended interchange rate of 1250 15 for financial 5 for nonfinancial The cost per transaction for WLAOs are higher as their hits per day per ATM are low compared to bank ATMs The cost of operating ATMs per month may further rise by about 15 if cassette swap is implemented 18 Summary of the recommendations of the Committee is given below Given that the cost of operating ATMs has gone up whereas the interchange fees and the cap on customer ATM usage charges has not been reviewed since 2012 and 2008 respectively the Committee after carefully reviewing various options along with the impact on stakeholders customers makes the following recommendations Further the Committee also noted with concern the lack of new ATM deployments especially in semi urban and rural centers 181 Review of ATM usage charges 1811 Number of mandatory free transaction inclusive of both financial and nonfinancial allowed on other bank and nonbank ATMs To increase the free transactions at ATMs in all centers having population less than 1 million as per Census 2011 and to be reviewed from time to time from existing 5 to 6 per month This would encourage more persons to use the banking channel This will help customers in Semi Urban and Rural areas where penetration of digital modes of payment is expected to take some more time to access and use banking channels To continue the existing 3 free transactions per month at ATMs in metro and satellite citiestowns and apply the same to all centers with population of 1 million and above as per Census 2011 and to be reviewed from time to time instead of only 6 Metros Satellite cities towns Mumbai Delhi Kolkata Chennai Hyderabad and Bengaluru To discourage high cash withdrawals from ATMs only cash withdrawal transactions up to and including 5000 to be considered for free transactions Banks may levy charges on the customer for every individual transaction above 5000 1812 Banks may decide on the number of free transactions for use of own bank ATMs as per appropriate Board approved policy 1813 To increase the upper cap for charging customer for financial transactions over and above the free transactions allowed by 20 ie from existing cap of 20 per transaction to cap of 24 per transaction plus applicable taxes 182 Interchange for interoperable domestic ATM transactions 1821 To encourage more ATMs to be installed in under penetrated areas which do not have adequate infrastructure for use of alternate payment systems like UPI QR CODE POS MACHINES Online banking a differential Interchange could be considered 1822 For transactions at ATMs in all centres with population of 1 million and above as per Census 2011 and to be reviewed from time to time the interchange to be increased by 2 ie from 15 to 17 plus applicable taxes for financial transactions and from 5 to 7 plus applicable taxes for nonfinancial transactions This shall cause an increase of about 16 on a blended basis 1823 For transactions at usage of ATMs in all centers with population of less than 1 million as per Census 2011 and to be reviewed from time to time the interchange be increased by 3 ie from 15 to 18 plus applicable taxes for financial transactions and from 5 to 8 plus applicable taxes for nonfinancial transactions restored to the old rate This shall cause an increase of about 24 on a blended basis Most of the WLAOs also concentrate in the semi urban and rural areas and would be encouraged to operate in this space thereby achieving the purpose of increasing ATM penetration in these areas and servicing the customers there 183 The committee also felt that both the above recommendation ie on the interchange and customer ATM usage charges including free transactions should be simultaneously implemented so that impact is uniform for all stakeholders while achieving the objective of increased ATM penetration 184 The above recommendations have been made without taking into consideration the implementation of the cassette swap as mentioned elsewhere in the report which could add another about 15 additional cost If it is to be implemented then a commensurate increase in ATM usage charges and ATM interchange should be considered as appropriate 185 The Committee also recommends review of interchange and customer ATM usage charges at stipulated intervals to be decided by RBI 2 Status of ATMs deployed in India 21 ATM is an important channel for customers to access cash anytime and anywhere any ATM Ease and ability of withdrawing cash from bank accounts at the time and place of choice requirement gives confidence to the customer to keep money in the bank accounts thus increasing the money in circulation through formal banking channel 22 ATMs are deployed by banks for serving their own customers and also provide services to other banks customers as Acquirers where they earn interchange income WLAOs are given licenses by RBI to primarily set up ATMs in underserved SemiUrban and Rural areas who depend on interchange fees as the primary revenue source The ATMs deployment in the country is geographically categorized under Metro Urban SemiUrban and Rural centers 23 Background of ATMs in India 231 The first ATM in India was set up in 1987 by HSBC in Mumbai In the following twelve years about 1500 ATMs were set up in India In 1997 the Indian Banks Association IBA set up Swadhan the first network of shared ATMs which allowed interoperable transactions It was managed by India Switch Company ISC for five years up to 31st Dec03 and allowed cardholders to withdraw cash from any ATM in the network The card holders paid a fee if they did not have an account with the bank that owned the ATM In 2002 the network connected over 1000 ATMs of the 53 member banks of the association Once Swadhan network was nonoperational group of banks formed ATMsharing networks such as CashTree etc 232 In August 2004 the IDRBT launched National Financial Switch NFS to link together the countrys ATMs in a single network The IDRBT then worked towards bringing all major banks in India on board and by December 2009 the network had grown to connect 49880 ATMs of 37 banks thereby emerging as the largest network of shared ATMs in the country 233 The Reserve Bank of India RBI granted authorisation to NPCI to take over the operations of NFS from the IDRBT on an as is where is basis in October 2009 NPCI took over the operations of NFS from 14th Dec09 Over the span of few years NFS ATM network has grown many folds becoming the leading multilateral ATM network in the country As on 31st Jul19 there were 1140 members includes 110 Direct members 966 Sub members 56 RRBs and 7 WLAOs using NFS network connected to more than 222 Lac ATMs 24 Sector wise Geographical region wise ATM deployment in India 241 According to Census 2011 out of the 121 billion people 833 million 69 live in rural areas while 377 million live in urban areas Whereas the total ATMs deployed is about 222 K as of March 2019 53 of ATMs are in Metro Urban centers and 47 of ATMs in SemiUrban Rural centers 242 Public Sector Banks PSBs have 61 of total share of ATM deployment Private Banks including payment banks small finance banks and foreign banks have about 30 ATMs and WLAOs have about 9 ATMs PSBs have evenly deployed ATMs with 50 of their ATMs in metrourban centers and 50 ATMs in semiurbanrural centers Private Banks have deployed more no of ATMs in metrourban centers at 67 whereas only 33 of ATMs are deployed in semiurbanrural centers WLAOs which have deployed 20 k ATMs have majority of their ATMs in semiurbanrural centers 25 Summary of ATMs deployed year on year and no of debit cards in force are given below 251 The no of debit cards which was at about 662 Mn at the end of March 2016 have increased to about 925 Mn in March 2019 ie increase of about 40 whereas no of ATMs have grown only by 5 during the period from March 2016 to March 2017 and negligible increase since then 252 The drop in no of debit cards in June 2019 is due to migration of magstripe cards to EMV chip cards and many banks have blockedclosed magstripe only cards This number is expected to go up again once all the magstripe cards are converted to EMV chip cards and issued to the cardholders 26 Summary of no of debit cards and credit card financial transactions Period AprJun19 261 Though PoS Ecom transactions using debit cards are increasing 66 of total financial transactions by debit cards continue to be ATM transactions 262 On an average 120 to 130 financial transactions are performed at an ATM every day Total cash withdrawal from ATMs in the country is about 290000 Crores every month with average ticket size per cash withdrawal transaction of about 3600 Ref RBI website Bankwise ATMPOSCARDs statistics 27 Domestic Interoperable cash withdrawal transactions Amount wise slabs Monthly average transactions for 3 months Period AprJun19 28 Debit Cards to ATM Ratio 281 Over the years while the no of debit cards is constantly increasing predominantly by PSBs by opening accounts in rural and semiurban centers using BC network the growth in no of ATMs has been particularly low in recent years There were 2908 debit cards per ATM in March 2012 which has increased to 4171 debit cards per ATM in March 2019 The high debit card to ATM ratio indicates that there is urgent need for more ATMs in the country Similarly for 1 Lac debit cards only 34 ATMs were available in March 2012 which is now further reduced to only 24 ATMs in March 2019 Primarily attributed to the sharp growth in card issued for PMJDY accounts This emphasizes low ATM coverage to cater to the rapidly growing debit cards issued in the country 29 Summary of ATM access per lac population 291 ATM access in India lags most of the emerging markets and large economies like Russia Brazil China South Africa US UK etc The no of ATMs per 100000 adults was 22 in India in year 2017 as per the World Bank data This is substantially low as compared to China with 81 ATMs South Africa with 68 ATMs and Brazil Russia having more than 100 ATMs per 100000 adults in the same period 210 Summary of no of incremental ATMs deployed 2101 While the ATM access in India is low even the new ATM deployment is severely impacted over the recent years due to prohibitive costs of operating ATMs making them unviable In the last 2 years the net incremental ATM deployment in the country is negative 211 Summary of Domestic Interoperable ATM transactions a Acquirer transactions monthly average for 3 months AprJun19 b Issuer transactions monthly average for 3 months AprJun19 2111 At an interoperable level Public Sector Banks acquire 45 of the overall transactions whereas their issuer transactions volume are at 69 Similarly the Private Banks acquire 41 of overall transactions and their issuer transactions share is very low at 27 White Label ATM Operators WLAOs acquire 10 of the overall ATM transactions Cooperative banks and others account for the remaining 2112 The financial transactions constitute about 79 of overall ATM interoperable transactions whereas the nonfinancial transactions which includes balance inquiry mini statement PIN change etc constitute about 21 Considering ON US transactions the overall ATM financial and nonfinancial transactions ratio may be about 7525 212 Bank sector wise Domestic Interoperable ATM transactions Acquirer Issuer AprJun19 2121 The PSBs are mostly netissuers whereas the large Private Banks are netacquirers and WLAOs are only Acquirers The PSBs remain net Issuers in view of the fact that their rate of ATM deployment lagged behind their rate of debit card issuance While they have done phenomenal work in acquiring new customers under the Jan Dhan Yojana however the prohibitive cost of setting up and securing the ATMs have led to virtual stagnation of ATM installation 3 ATM Usage charges and Interchange 31 Summary of customer charges on ATM usage 311 ATM Usage charges levied by banks to their customers for usage of own bank and other bank ATMs were not regulated by RBI until the issue of the circular dated 10th Mar08 312 RBI had issued a Draft Approach Paper on Fair Pricing and Enhanced Access of Bank ATMs As per the Paper the charges levied by banks for ATM usage were ranging from NIL to 57 per transaction when their customers use the ATMs of other banks for cash withdrawal and balance inquiry in the country The charges were dependent on the network relationship between the Bank owning the ATM and the customers own Bank 313 To establish a fair and transparent framework for levy of service charges for ATMs such that it would encourage greater financial inclusion and promote enhanced access to ATMs RBI issued a circular on 10th Mar08 regulating the customer charges for ATM usage 32 The RBI Circular dated 10th Mar08 fixed following Customer charges for use of ATMs for cash withdrawal and balance inquiry The charge of 20 indicated will be all inclusive and no other charges will be levied to the customers under any other head irrespective of the amount of withdrawal 33 IBA Circular dated 22nd Aug09 NoCERB1at1216 IBA Circular dated 31st Aug09 NoCERB1atm1284 on ATM Transactions with effect from 15th Oct09 331 The Circular was issued based on the consent received from RBI for capping cash withdrawal from other bank ATMs Maximum cash withdrawal by customers of other banks may be limited to 10000 per transaction Bank may allow free cash withdrawals from other bank ATMs only up to five transactions per calendar month 34 RBI Circular dated 14th Aug14 with effect from 01st Nov14 stipulated the free ATM transactions The ceiling cap on customer charges of 20 per transaction plus service tax if any will be applicable 35 In the recent RBI circular dated 14th Aug19 on usage of ATMs RBI has stipulated that transactions which fail due to technical reasons shall not be counted as valid ATM transactions for the customer Consequently no charges therefor shall be levied Noncash withdrawal transactions such as balance enquiry cheque book request payment of taxes funds transfer etc which constitute onus transactions ie when a card is used at an ATM of the bank which has issued the card shall also not be part of the number of free ATM transactions 36 Interchange fees levied for interoperable domestic ATM transactions The interchange fees was reviewed in the Special NFS Steering committee meeting held on 5th July 2012 As decided in the meeting the interchange fees were revised with effect from 1st Aug12 as given below Reference NPCI Circular No NPCINFSOC No65201213 dated 14th Jul12 4 Recent Regulatory Guidelines 41 The recent regulatory guidelines have impacted the cost of operating ATMs significantly While it is necessary to have safe and secure banking channels and ATMs being one of the main channels for cash transactions it is also required to understand and appreciate the cost impact of complying with the requirements Banks and WLAOs should have a mechanism whereby the incremental cost incurred by them can be recovered over a period of time to ensure viability of operating of ATMs 42 List of Regulatory guidelines impacting the cost of operating ATMs and ATM transactions are given below 421 RBI circular dated 27th Aug15 on migration from magnetic strip cards to EMV chip and PIN based transactions Issuing banks were advised to migrate all their magnetic stripe cards to EMV chip and PIN cards by December 31 2018 422 RBI circular dated 26th May16 on enabling EMV chip cards acceptance and processing at ATMs Banks have been advised to ensure that all the existing ATMs and microATMs installed operated by them should be enabled for processing of EMV Chip and PIN cards by 30th September 2017 However for reasons best known RBI has not made it mandatory to reject magnetic stripe cards used on the ATM as the cards were to be replaced with EMV Chip cards 423 RBI circular dated 6th Apr18 on cash management activities of the banks Banks shall put in place certain minimum standards in their arrangements with the service providers for cash management related activities Few of these standards have been given below 4231 Minimum net worth requirement of 1 billion Cash should be transported only in security cash vans Should be a specially designed and fabricated Light Commercial Vehicle LCV Having separate passenger and cash compartments with a CCTV Should accommodate two custodians and two armed security guards gunmen besides the driver 4232 Should have GPS and monitored live with geofencing mapping Night movement of cash vans should be discouraged 4233 Banks are advised to implement it within 90 days of circular 424 RBI circular dated 12th Apr18 on Cassette Swaps in ATMs It is advised that banks may consider using lockable cassettes in their ATMs which shall be swapped at the time of cash replenishment Bank shall implement it in a phased manner covering at least one third ATMs every year such that all ATMs achieve cassette swap by March 31 2021 425 RBI circular dated 20th Jun18 on Control measures for ATMs Banks and WhiteLabel ATM Operators are advised to initiate action and implement control measures as per prescribed timelines i Not less than 25 by Sep18 ii Not less than 50 by Dec18 iii Not less than 75 by Mar19 iv All of them shall be upgraded by Jun19 426 Ministry of Home Affairs notification dated 8th Aug18 Banks and other financial service providers have been advised to consider laying down certain guidelines for standard operating procedures for providing security by the private agencies to cash transportation activities Few of the guidelines of the said notification is given below a Cash van to not carry cash of more than 5 crores per van b All ATMs to have one time electronic combination locks c No cash loading of the ATMs to be carried out After 9 PM in urban areas after 6 PM in rural areas and before 9 AM or after 4 PM in the districts notified by the Central Government as Left Wing Extremism LWE affected areas d To use specially designed and fabricated cash van e The requisite number of trained staff per cash van should be as given below Driver one armed security guards two and ATM officer or custodian two The rules shall come into force on the expiry of 6 months of the publication 427 RBI circular dated 14th May19 on Outsourcing of Cash Management Reconciliation of Transactions Timely reconciliation of transactions ie ATM cash replenishment between the bank the service provider and its subcontractor Cash indents by the Service Provider shall be made at least a day in advance T1 where T is the day of cash loading in consultation with the chest nodal branch Multiple points of cash withdrawal may be avoided and shall be restricted to one in each centre However metropolitan centres may have two points of cash withdrawal Reconciliation of transactions shall be done between the bank the service provider and its subcontractors at least on a T3 basis In the event of a dispute or the reporting of alleged attempted breach of security laid down procedures access to video footage of the ATM may be provided by the bank to the service provider and its subcontractors on request 428 RBI circular dated 14th Jun19 on Security measures for ATMs Measures aimed at mitigating risks in ATM Operations and enhancing security All ATMs shall be operated for cash replenishment only with digital One Time Combination OTC locks All ATMs shall be grouted to a structure wall pillar floor etc by September 30 2019 except for ATMs installed in highly secured premises such as airports etc which have adequate CCTV coverage and are guarded by state central security personnel Banks may also consider rolling out a comprehensive esurveillance mechanism at the ATMs to ensure timely alerts and quick response 43 The impact of all the above regulations on the overall cost of ATM operations is an addition of 25 to 30 and has an impact on the cost of servicing customers and hence it needs to be addressed suitably 5 Presentations made to the Committee 51 The Committee requested that a presentation be made by RBI officials conveying the views of RBI on the recent RBI guidelines on ATM related issues including the objectives security aspects cost assumptions etc The Dy Governor was kind enough to agree to the request 52 Details of presentations done by RBI officials are summarized below Presentation on Security measures in ATMs by Department of Currency Management 53 RBI circular dated 12th April 2018 Banks were advised to consider using lockable cassettes in their ATMs which shall be swapped at the time of cash replenishment It was advised to be implemented in a phased manner covering at least one third ATMs operated by the banks every year such that all ATMs achieve cassette swap by March 31 2021 531 Cost of Cassette Swap Assumptions by RBI As on March 2019 there are nearly 202 lakh ATMs of commercial banks each ATM has 4 cassettes for storing notes which can be efficiently used in any ATM of same make model from a common pool ATM cash replenishment is carried out once in 3 days on an average thus additional cassettes required will be about 269 lakh 202 4 3 Estimated cost is of 162 crore towards additional cassettes required considering average cost per cassette at 6000 and average cash loading once in every 3 days However supporting documents for estimates were not made available Due to wear and tear assuming life of a plastic cassette to be 2 years recurring cost will be about 81 crore per year 162 2 Cassette swap will also require float currency left over cash in the returning cassette Globally this float is estimated to be in the range of 1020 of notes loaded in the cassette As per industry estimates currency stored across all ATMs is valued at about 21000 crore about 1 of NIC Thus efficiently managed additional value of about 2100 crore will be needed about 01 of NIC 532 The findings of the Committee on the issue of Cassette Swap Based on the inputsfeedback received from banks WLAOs and other stakeholders it is observed that The cost per cassette is estimated between 14000 to 21000 as compared to 4000 to 8000 assumed by RBI This is based on the information obtained from major OEM vendors The cost at the minimum is about 23 times the cost assumed by RBI The average frequency of loading cash at ATMs was assumed to be 3 days While the data from top banks indicates that it is almost daily in Metros and 265 in Rural areas with the average work out to replacement every two days Assumption of minimum no of cassettes required at 133 times may not be appropriate It was felt that minimum no of cassettes required would be in the range of 2 to 3 times of the current numbers This is considering the average frequency of cash loadings and in many locations the cassettes needs to be kept ready for loading next day increasing the numbers required Also existing cassettes of many ATMs may not be lockable and would require replacement Cassettes cost alone on conservative estimates works around 3000 crores against RBI estimate of 162 crores The cost of cassettes for cash recyclers shall be much higher Assumptions 222 Lacs ATMs 25 sets including replacement of existing cassettes 4 cassettes per ATM 14000 The increase in cash holdings at ATM and in transit was estimated at 1020 in presentation while it is understood that the cash holding shall be substantially more in the range 2025 The cost of increased cash holdings on account of replacement of cash at ATM by Full Cassettes and increased operating costs for Cassettes by the Cash Management Service providers have not been factored in the cost working presented The cost impact of cassette on storage capacity loading frequency has not been appropriately factored in the assumptions Further most of the Cash Replenishment Agencies CRAs do not have vaulting facility whereas Cassette Swap model will require CRAs to build capacity for vaulting as they may be required to keep cash overnight at many locations which would also impact the cash holdings Setting up of vaulting facilities would be an additional cost The cost of investment in Cassette Swap model is substantially high and commensurate benefits are not seen If Cassette Swap model has to be mandatorily implemented it will raise the cost of total expenses and indirectly impact the interchange and customer fees by at about 15 As the cost is huge for the industry the recommendations have to be made accordingly factoring the higher costs 54 RBI Circular dated June 14 2019 All ATMs shall be operated for cash replenishment only with digital One Time Combination OTC locks All ATMs shall be grouted to a structure wall pillar floor etc by September 30 2019 except for ATMs installed in highly secured premises such as airports etc which have adequate CCTV coverage and are guarded by state central security personnel Banks may also consider rolling out a comprehensive esurveillance mechanism at the ATMs to ensure timely alerts and quick response 541 Cost impact a Assumption 40 of ATMs need OTC locks while the rest already have it and about 10 ATMs are yet to be grouted Capex cost Between 21936 Cr to 26083 Cr This is considering the cost of OTC lock in the range of 25000 to 30000 installation cost of 2000 per ATM and costing of grouting ATM in the range of 500 to 1000 b Assumption 90 of ATMssites need esurveillance while the rest are already covered Opex Cost Between 65512 Cr to 152860 Cr This is considering the cost of implementing CCTV Cameras Emergency Alarm with QRT shall be in range of 3000 to 7000 per ATM c While only 10 of ATMs remain to be grouted the no of ATMs remaining to be fitted with OTC locks is very high and a lot remains to be done for implementing Esurveillance at all the ATMs 55 RBI officials also made a presentation on following two circulars 551 RBI circular dated 26th May 2016 on upgradation of ATMs to be EMV compliant and dated 21st June 2018 on Control measures for ATMs The timeline for EMV compliant upgradation was given as 30th Sep 2017 RBI had not estimated the cost for EMV compliant upgradation of ATMs for the Industry Up to end of August 2019 around 140000 ATMs have been upgraded WLAOs have just started the upgradation and very few have been done this is mainly due to huge cost to be incurred for EMV implementation and with present interchange it is becoming unviable for them With reference to control measures for ATMs RBI had estimated a cost of around 701 Crores for upgrading ATMs with the OS of Windows XP There are still about 38350 ATMs with unsupported version of software They had not estimated the costs for other measures mentioned in the circular including antiskimming devices whitelisting time bound access for Admin etc Though antiskimming devices are costly it shall be required as ATMs would have to support magnetic stripe cards and fallback transactions However in view of the mandated EMV implementation with chip and pin cards the utility of Anti skimming devices need to be examined If RBI mandates rejection of only magstripe cards the need for antiskimming devices can be done away with 56 Presentations by other stakeholders Cost of operating ATMs Inputs wrt cost of operating ATMs and their views on ATM usage charges and Interchange were taken from all stakeholders viz Banks White Label ATM operators and Brown label ATM operators 561 Public Sector Banks PSBs Monthly average cost of operating ATMs for PSBs other than SBI is in the range of 83700 to 95000 per ATM including care taker security guard cost This cost may increase by about 10 to 15 after complying with recent ATM security guidelines control measures and increase in cash management cost Refer Appendix 3 part A Monthly average cost of operating ATMs for SBI is in the range of 65850 to 88850 per ATM including care taker cost This cost may increase by about 15 to 20 after complying with all recent guidelines The average cost of transaction considering 130 average financial transactions per ATM per day comes to cost in the range of 1610 to 1830 per transaction blended financial nonfinancial precompliance and may increase by about 10 to 15 after complying with recent ATM security guidelines including cassette swap Most of the banks suggested that ATM interchange may be continued at the existing rate Despite having a very large no of ATMs installed PSBs were IssuersPayers in view of the substantially large no of accounts most of which are PMJDY account Similarly many banks suggested increase in the upper cap for ATM usage charges from 20 to 25 and reducing no of free transactions to 3 per month for all locations for OFF US ATM transactions Since they are the largest issuer of cards any increase in interchange would directly hit the bottom line of the banks already losing money due to this They felt the cost of cassette swap implementation being prohibitive it should not be implemented 562 Private Banks Monthly average cost of operating ATMs is about 106700 per ATM including the cost of securityesurveillance This cost is estimated to be increased by about 20500 per month per ATM if cassette swap is implemented Refer Appendix 3 part B The average cost of transaction considering 110 financial transactions per ATM per day comes to about 32 per financial transaction and may increase by 7 per transactions post complying with MHA guidelines and cassette swap requirements The cost estimate appears to be on higher side as compared to other stakeholders About 65 of transactions on their ATMs are acquiring transactions Banks suggested to revise the interchange and bring it at par with the cost incurred They also suggested to deregulate ATM usage charges like interest on savings accounts MAB charges other fees and charges etc and make all nonfinancial transactions charged from 1st transaction itself as multiple digital avenues are available to the customer This would also encourage digital transactions the wish list of Government RBI They also suggested that Cassette swap installation is expensive and need not be implemented as of now 563 Foreign Banks No change was suggested in current ATM interchange fee structure Suggested customer charges to be increased to 30 from existing 20 and free transactions to be reduced to 3 for all locations 564 White Label ATM Operators WLAO WLAOs have 79 of their ATMs deployed in Semi Urban and Rural areas SURU against 47 deployed by Industry in SURU Monthly average cost of operating ATMs is about 60850 with esurveillance It does not have cost of care takersecurity guard Refer Appendix 3 part C The average cost of transaction considering 78 transactions financial Non financial per ATM per day comes to cost of about 20 per transaction blended financial nonfinancial precompliance and shall be about 26 after complying with recent ATM security guidelines including cassette swap Suggested revision of interchange for financial transaction from 15 to 30 and for NonFinancial transaction from 5 to 10 Also suggested to consider an option for WLAOs to levy convenience fees access fees over and above interchange In as much as it did not impact them they have not given a suggestion for the change in customer ATM usage charges for OFF US customer transactions 565 Brown Label ATM Operators BLAOs These are managed service providers which deploy and operate ATMs for banks They manage about 30 of overall ATMs in the country excluding WLAO ATMs Monthly average cost of operating ATMs is about 70565 per ATM pre compliance and would be about 83700 per ATM after complying with recent ATM security guidelines and control measures MHA guidelines and Cassette Swap requirements However this cost do not include cost of cash holding as it is borne by banks in BLA model Refer Appendix 3 part D The average cost of transaction considering 130 per ATM per day comes to about 18 per transaction precompliance and shall be about 2150 after complying with recent guidelines including Cassette Swap Suggested interchange for financial transaction be increased to 30 and non financial transactions to 10 Also suggested that banks should bear the cost of compliance to recent guidelines 57 Summary 571 There were multiple assumptions by different stakeholders while estimating the average cost of operating ATMs ie some including cost of security guard or e surveillance while some with certain other assumptions 572 Banks should take a call on the need for and number of Security Guards to be deployed considering esurveillance being implemented at all the ATMs Since certain States mandate deployment of security guards at every ATM based on the inputs received it is felt that about 30 of ATMs would require Security Guards and thus calculation of cost of operating ATM be arrived at factoring the same In all other cases esurveillance has been proposed 573 After some normalization average monthly cost of operating an ATM is estimated to be in the range of 75000 to 80000 per ATM excluding Cassette Swap The blended estimated cost financial and nonfinancial transactions both together in ratio of 7525 per transaction 120 average financial transactions per ATM per day comes in the range of 1560 to 1670 and 130 avgfintxn it comes in the range of 1450 to 1540 This is against the existing blended interchange rate of 1250 15 for financial 5 for nonfinancial The cost per transaction for WLAOs is higher as their hits per day per ATM are low compared to bank ATMs The cost of operating ATMs per month may further rise by about 15 if cassette swap is implemented 6 Opportunity for efficiency in ATM operations 61 Management of Cash 611 For ATM cash replenishment cash is provided by the banks and cash logistics is handled by the outsourced partners There is an opportunity to optimize the cash cost for the ATMs by deriving an optimum level of cash required for each ATM based on the historical transaction trends and thereby optimizing the loading for the ATMs There are chances of imbalance in the cash balances at the ATMs leading to inefficiencies 612 Banks can also look at converting their ATMs to Cash Recyclers OR deploy more no of cash recyclers in locations where cash deposits and cash withdrawals both are equally required and enable Interoperable Cash Deposits ICD transactions 613 WLAs are authorised by RBI for operating ATMs Providing access to working capital required for replenishing the cash in ATM at Repo Rates as compared to the current MCLR linked working capital facilities would help them in reducing cost of operating ATMs In addition retail cash sourcing option from large cash accumulating agencies like Petrol Pumps super markets may be considered 62 Electricity costs Connectivity 621 Optimizing the monthly electricity bills by switching over to LED lights and timer controlled lighting in the ATMs Requirement of airconditioner at each ATM location can also be relooked as the same may not be mandatorily required for the functioning of the ATMs 622 Connectivity can be switched from VSAT technology to 4G Modems CDMA etc to reduce cost of maintenance and deliver better availability 623 Power including power sockets and Telecommunication Network cabling carry data or supporting ATM services should be protected from interception or damage It should be protected from unauthorized access and wiretapping 63 Security guards 631 Physical security guard wherever not mandatory can be replaced with esurveillance system this can bring cost efficiency in running the ATMs 632 It is understood that some regionStates mandates deploying of security guards at the ATMs Doing away with mandatory security guards at all the ATMs across the country where esurveillance is implemented by banksWLAOs shall help in reducing cost of operating ATMs in those regionsStates 64 Service availability monitoring 641 Real time monitoring of service availability of ATMs and cash out scenarios shall help in raising timely alerts and ensuring high availability of ATMs This can help increase the ATM footfalls provide better service to customers and also reduce the per transaction cost 642 Monitoring ATM wise customer complaints transaction failure and suspect transactions at the ATMs shall help in taking preventive measures for reducing customer complaints and cash shortages 65 Reconciliation 651 It is important to perform daily reconciliation of ATM transactions considering CBS data switch data network files for interoperable transactions ATM Electronic Journal EJ logs etc to have better control over the GLs for ATM transactions 652 Cash in ATM reconciliation ie tallying physical cash balance at the ATM on the basis of ATM Counters Cash Balance report CBR with ATM GL balance as per CBS is important to identify excess cash or shortages at the ATM Such excess or shortages as the case may be must be investigated and appropriate action should be taken immediately 653 Failed transactions identified during reconciliation should be proactively reversed to customers account without waiting for customer complaints This shall also help banksWLAOs to avoid payment of compensation to customers for delayed credit for failed ATM transactions 66 Innovations and Value Added services on ATMs Presently ATMs are mainly seen as a channel for dispensing cash though it can be leveraged for multiple other purposes More than 900 Mn monthly transactions on ATMs clearly highlights the strong customer acceptance of ATMs across geographies and town classes With the help of advanced technology ATMs can be used for additional banking services selectively and can enhance customer experience 661 Cardless cash withdrawal at ATMs Some of the banks have started provided cardless ATM cash withdrawals for their customers Few of the banks are also providing remittance to beneficiary Instant Money Transfer using cardless ATM cash withdrawal facility Option of providing QR based cardless ATM cash withdrawal services using UPI Unified Payment Interface at interoperable level can also be explored 662 The Nandan Nilekani Committee report on Deeping of Digital Payments has recommended to explore options such as reimagining ATMs as an access point for customer education awareness and support It recommends that features of ATMs should be enhanced merely from cash dispenser to support the gamut of banking facilities including Cash Deposit Bills Payment Funds Transfer Tax Deposits Mobile Recharge etc in addition to customer support and grievance reporting so as to act as a complete Digital facilitation point 663 In order to make ATMs further inclusive ATMs should include user interface support by providing option of more number of local languages in the region of operations 664 ATMs can also be used for advertising their financial products such as insurance mutual funds loans etc ATMs could be used to generate leads and capture initial interest of customers sales fulfilment can happen offline 7 Conclusion Recommendations 71 ATMs play an important role for customers to access funds in their account anywhere and anytime of the day This gives them confidence to keep monies in their bank accounts rather than holding cash as they would have the ability to withdraw cash from ATMs anytime they need Now with many value added services VAS being offered through ATMs it has become like an extension center of a bank branch where customers can fulfil their basic banking needs and also can avail various other services 72 The number of debit cards issued has grown substantially outpacing the growth of ATMs in last 3 years With more no of people accessing bank accounts especially due to various financial inclusion initiatives including PMJDY and DBT transfers there is an urgent need to have more no of ATMs especially in semiurban and rural centers 73 If the increase in no of ATMs is not commensurate with the increase in no of debit cards to fulfil basic banking needs of the customers banks may have high footfalls at the branches The cost of serving the customer at branch especially for cash transactions is substantially high as compared to per transaction cost at the ATM Banks should consider the cost saved on Branch OTC transactions and also the cost of setting up of branches if usage of ATMs and other Alternate channels are not increased Due to convenience of usage of ATMs the number of withdrawal transactions at ATMs per customer is higher as compared to that at the Branch hence the comparison of a cost of single ATM transactions with single branch transaction may not be appropriate 74 No of ATMs in the country over the last 3 years is almost stagnant as operating ATMs have become unviable for banks and WLAOs The cost of operating ATMs have risen substantially over the last one and half year due to significant investments in implementing EMV upgrading OS software antiskimming devices etc and for complying with other regulatory guidelines on ATM security and control measures The cost shall further increase to comply with recent guidelines on cash management and logistics and for implementing Cassette Swap 75 Upper cap of 20 that bank can levy for ATM cash withdrawal has not been reviewed for over a decade ie since March 2008 Number of free transactions allowed were also reviewed last in August 2014 ie about 5 years back and have not undergone a change 76 ATM Interchange fees paid by Customers Bank Issuing Bank to the BankWLAO whose ATM is used by the customer ATM Acquiring BankWLAO has not been reviewed since 1st Aug12 Interchange has been 15 plus applicable taxes for financial transactions and 5 plus applicable taxes for nonfinancial transactions It is understood that multiple discussions had taken place to review the interchange but no consensus on revision of interchange could be arrived at However there is a general consensus amongst the banks that cost of operating ATMs have increased substantially and there is an urgent need to review the ATM usage charges and the interchange for making ATM operations viable 77 Current rate of interchange and cap on ATM usage charges disincentivises the Acquirers to invest in deploying new ATMs Net Issuers prefer paying the existing interchange rather than bearing the cost of operating ATMs which would be much higher thereby not willing to invest in new ATMs Possibly this is the very reason the number of ATMs remains stagnated over the last 3 years and RBI has set up this Committee to examine the entire gamut of ATM charges fees and to review the ATM interchange fee structure with a view to give a fillip to the ATM deployment in the unbanked areas The payment of the existing interchange itself is hurting the issuers and any substantial increase in the interchange would hurt them further as explained earlier 78 Recommendations Given that the cost of operating ATMs has gone up whereas the interchange fees and the cap on customer ATM usage charges has not been reviewed since 2012 and 2008 respectively the Committee after carefully reviewing various options along with the impact on stakeholders customers makes the following recommendations Further the Committee also noted with concern the lack of new ATM deployments especially in semi urban and rural centers 781 Review of ATM usage charges 7811 Number of mandatory free transaction inclusive of both financial and non financial allowed on other bank and nonbank ATMs To increase the free transactions at ATMs in all centers having population less than 1 million as per Census 2011 and to be reviewed from time to time from existing 5 to 6 per month This would encourage more persons to use the banking channel To continue and extend the existing 3 free transactions per month at ATMs to all centers with population of 1 million as per Census 2011 and to be reviewed from time to time and above instead of only 6 Metros Satellite cities towns Mumbai Delhi Kolkata Chennai Hyderabad and Bengaluru To discourage high cash withdrawals from ATMs only cash withdrawal transactions up to and including 5000 to be considered for free transactions Banks may levy charges on the customer for every individual transaction above 5000 7812 Banks may decide on the number of free transactions for use of own bank ATMs as per appropriate Board approved policy 7813 To increase the upper cap for charging customer for financial transactions over and above the free transactions allowed by 20 ie from existing cap of 20 per transaction to cap of 24 per transaction plus applicable taxes 782 Interchange for interoperable domestic ATM transactions 7821 To encourage more ATMs to be installed in under penetrated areas which do not have adequate infrastructure for use of alternate payment systems like UPI QR CODE POS MACHINES Online banking a differential Interchange could be considered 7822 For transactions at ATMs in all centers with population of 1 million and above as per Census 2011 and to be reviewed from time to time the interchange to be increased by 2 ie from 15 to 17 for financial transactions and from 5 to 7 for nonfinancial transactions This shall be an increase of about 16 on a blended basis 7823 For usage of ATMs in all other centers with population of less than 1 million as per Census 2011 and to be reviewed from time to time the interchange be increased by 3 ie from 15 to 18 for financial transactions and from 5 to 8 for nonfinancial transactions restored to the old rate This shall be an increase of about 24 on a blended basis Most of the WLAOs also concentrate in the semi urban and rural areas and would be encouraged to operate in this space thereby achieving the purpose of increasing ATM penetration in these areas and servicing the customers there 783 While the above recommended changes in interchange do not cover the complete cost per transaction it is felt that given the asymmetry in acquiring and issuing transaction volumes a via media needs to be arrived at between Issuing banks and Acquiring banks Hence an ATM interchange increase to cover the full costs of running an ATM is not recommended Increased transaction volumes are expected to offset the difference in cost per transaction and weighted average interchange recommended Further the WLAs also should make effort to increase the number of transactions at their ATMs which will bring unit costs down 784 The Committee also felt that both the above recommendations ie on the interchange and customer ATM usage charges including free transactions should be simultaneously implemented so that impact is uniform for all stakeholders while achieving the objective of increased ATM penetration 785 The above recommendations have been made without taking into consideration the implementation of the cassette swap which could add about 15 additional cost If it is to be implemented then a commensurate increase in ATM usage charges and ATM interchange should be considered as appropriate 786 The Committee requests RBI to consider the above given recommendations favourably and accordingly advise Banks WLAOs NPCI other ATM network Operators and IBA for implementation 787 The Committee also recommends review of interchange and customer ATM usage charges at stipulated intervals to be decided by RBI Appendix 2 Details of Committee meetings held Appendix 3 Cost estimates of operating ATMs

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/PublicationsView.aspx?id=19417,Date Assessment of the progress of digitisation from cash to electronic,1 Background 11 The digital revolution is taking the world by storm and no other area has witnessed such metamorphosis as payment and settlement systems resulting in a myriad of digital options for the common man Consumers now have a range of options to choose from when selecting a payment method to complete a transaction They make this selection based on the value they attribute to a payment method in a certain situation as each payment mode has its own use and purpose In India like in many parts of the world cash is the wellestablished and widely used payment instrument It is however reassuring that noncash payments especially those using electronic or digital modes are rapidly increasing 2 Approach 21 Cash is all pervasive easy to use and store and offers great convenience The challenge in assessing the progress of a country from cash to digitisation arises from the fact that given the anonymity of cash transactions it is very difficult to establish the exact volume of transactions conducted in cash and consequently the value of such transactions Notwithstanding this this paper studies the popularly used indicators over the world which denote the use of cash and which are considered as a proxy for cash payments 22 This study also analyses the measures of cash the enablers for payment systems and the measures of electronic payments over a timeframe of the last 5 years to ascertain the shift in India if any from cash to digital payments Further a comparison with the 26 member countries of the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures CPMI over the same five year period has also been attempted to evaluate Indias performance visvis other countries 3 Measure of Cash 31 While there is no accurate estimate of the cash payments two key indicators viz a the value of Currency in Circulation CIC versus Gross Domestic Product GDP and b the value of ATM withdrawals that take place across the country can be used for this purpose a Currency in Circulation 32 The amount of CIC is related to the use of cash as a payment instrument since one of the major forces of demand for currency is its use for making payments The CIC across the country increased at a Compounded Annual Growth Rate CAGR of 102 over the past 5 years ie between the financial years FY 201415 and 201819 33 It is assumed that having high CIC relative to GDP indicates that cash is highly preferred as a payment instrument Based on this assumption India continues to have a strong bias for cash payments Demonetisation and an active growth in GDP brought down the cash in circulation as a percentage of GDP to 870 in 201617 This increased to 1070 in 201718 and to 112 in 201819 which however is less than the predemonetisation level of 121 in 201516 The rate of increase is lower indicating a perceptible shift away from cash 34 The notes in circulation CIC minus coins in circulation increased at an average rate of 14 between October 2014 and October 2016 Assuming the same growth rate notes in circulation NIC would have been 2604953 crore in October 2019 NIC however was 2231090 crore indicating that digitaisation and reduction in cash usage helped reduce NIC by over 35 lakh crore 35 While Indias CIC levels reduced in 2018 as compared to 2014 other countries with the exception of Argentina China Indonesia Russia South Africa Sweden and Turkey had increasing cash levels Although cash is deeply embedded in the payment systems in India planned efforts postdemonetisation have shown a marked shift from cash to digital payments b Share of High Value denominated currency and Low Value denominated currency 36 Money is what money does Hicks 1969 Cash like other forms of money is used both as a means of payment and as a store of value A common way to try and disentangle the two types of cash demand is to assume that high value denomination notes are mostly held as a store of value and low denomination for payments Amromin and Chakravorti 2007 Over the past 5 years the demand for high value denominated currency has outpaced low value denominated currency which may indicate that cash is increasingly used as a store of value and less for making payments c Cash Withdrawals from ATMs 37 The cash withdrawals from ATMs increased over the past 5 years India is next only to China in terms of the cash withdrawals from ATMs However the percentage of cash withdrawals to GDP has been constant in India at around 17 In addition with a CAGR of 9 in terms of volume and 10 in terms of value the growth has been slow when compared to digital payment transactions which grew at a CAGR of 61 and 19 in terms of volume and value respectively indicating a shift towards digitisation Further the infrastructure for cash withdrawal ie ATMs has grown at a low pace CAGR of 4 during the past 5 years 4 Estimates of Cash Payments 41 Some surveys reports have attempted to measure the level of cash payments in the economy Although many of the reports are only estimates they do provide some indication of cash usage and digitisation in the country as also across the world According to these estimates cash still reigns supreme not only in India but in many other jurisdictions as well Payments are however quickly expanding to include online payment channels A report by Worldpay revealed that digital payment usage is increasing in the Asia Pacific region and estimated that the ecommerce market in the region will grow by a CAGR of 12 percent between 2016 and 2021 with India being one of the key drivers of this growth a The Pymnts Global Cash Index for Asia Pacific 42 The Pymnts Global Cash Index for Asia Pacific published in June 2018 computed the cash share of the wallet as the amount of cash withdrawn in a country as a share of its annual GDP to determine the popularity of physical cash exchange in comparison to that of alternative payment methods India was observed to be highly dependent on cash b The JP Morgan 2019 Global Payments Trends Report 43 The JP Morgan 2019 Global Payments Trends Report India Country Insights observed that Indian payments market historically dominated by cash is evolving to meet the demands of smartphone led online shopping culture with cards and digital wallets rising in prominence c The Worldpay Global Payments Report 2018 44 The Worldpay Global Payments Report 2018 observed that in India while cash continued to be the primary payment method for point of sale purchases card present eMoney dominated the online payments card not present The report observed that as internet penetration and the digital economy continues to grow there will be room for ongoing shift of payment forms 45 World over cards have replaced cash as a mode of making payments except in traditionally cash denominated jurisdictions like Germany Italy Japan and Russia In India the shift has been to electronic digital channels d Credit Suisse Group AG 46 According to a report by Credit Suisse Group AG 72 of Indias consumer transactions take place in cash double the rate as in China According to the report many merchants especially in rural areas remain unable or unwilling to accept digital transactions due to network connectivity issues and a reluctance to pay charges for what are often lowvalue transactions 5 Digital Payment Enablers a Mobile Phones and Internet 51 The increasing mobile density and mobile internet users are being leveraged upon by payment systems providers both banks and nonbanks to offer the payment services using mobile as an access device as well as an access channel Banks in particular have been offering mobile banking services through all three channels SMS USSD Unstructured Supplementary Services Data and mobile applications 52 As at end November 2019 India had over 1155 crore wireless telephone subscribers resulting in a teledensity of 8890 The urban teledensity and rural teledensity was 15733 and 5669 respectively The increase in smartphones has helped to accelerate the adoption of digital payments Further it has led to numerous innovations in payment mechanisms such as tokenisation and scanning of QR code for making payments using smartphones These have facilitated the shift from cash to noncash payments 53 Internet usage is on the rise in India While the average Indian until 2013 used to spend more on voice services than on mobile data services the majority of an average mobile bill now pertains to data charges according to a report by the Internet and Mobile Association of India IAMAI As on end November 2019 there were over 642 crore and 19 crore wireless and wireline broadband subscribers respectively across the country The increase in internet penetration has ensured adoption of digital modes of payments across the country 54 The growth of infrastructure in India has been phenomenal over the past six years especially with reference to availability of Mobile Cellular Subscriptions With increased penetration of 3G and 4G even in remote areas the internet network is rapidly expanding in India and provides a threshold of Digital Revolution b Bank Accounts 55 The number of deposit accounts has grown to 21740 crore as at end March 2019 These include deposit accounts in all commercial banks including Local Area Banks LABs Payment Banks PBs Small Finance Banks SFBs Regional Rural Banks RRBs and cooperative banks in the country As on October 30 2019 there were 3736 crore Basic Savings Bank Deposit BSBD accounts The availability of bank accounts plays a key role in initiating digital payments from to such accounts c Aadhaar 56 Since its launch in 2009 the Aadhaar a unique identity for all Indian citizens has been issued to over 124 crore individuals across the country Aadhaar enabled eKYC electronic Know Your Customer had resulted in an exponential growth of digital payments in India The use of Aadhaar has also been leveraged for authenticating payments to merchants and through business correspondents Aadhar has helped widen the reach and access of payment systems across the country The coverage of Aadhaar biometric identification has witnessed increased use in Government payments G2P It reduced leakages from the system by expunging fake beneficiaries These payment systems have helped migrate cash payments to electronic form e Debit and Credit Cards 57 In respect of card issuance during the past 5 years the number of credit cards issued increased from 211 lakh to over 550 lakh The same period also witnessed a steep increase in debit cards from 5535 lakh to over 8000 lakh This was supported by the 2960 lakh Rupay debit cards issued to BSBD account holders Increase in cards has facilitated growth in both online and physical PoS terminals based card payments resulting in an increase in digital transactions 58 Banks issued new cards to comply with the requirement to convert all existing Magstripe cards to EMV Chip and PIN compliant cards by December 31 2018 and subsequently removed deactivated cards from their systems resulting in a drop in debit cards outstanding The consolidation of public sector banks also contributed to this reduction 6 Progress in Digitisation 61 While there is no accurate measure of cash payments in the country the progress of various digital payments can be measured accurately Overall the digital payments in the country have witnessed a CAGR of 61 and 19 in terms of volume and value respectively over the past 5 years demonstrating a steep shift towards digital payments a Growth of digital payments 62 Within the digital payments retail electronic payments comprising credit transfers NEFT fast payments IMPS and UPI and direct debits ECS NACH have shown a rapid growth at a CAGR of 65 and 42 in terms of volume and value respectively Stored value cash issued in the form of wallets and prepaid cards demonstrated an increased adoption with a CAGR of 96 and 78 in terms of volume and value respectively 63 Debt and credit card based payments registered a CAGR of 44 and 40 in terms of volume and value respectively The adoption of card payments has been supported by innovations in the form of contactless payments and tokenisation technologies contributing to the growth In addition the use of cards for payments is increasing visavis their use for withdrawing cash 64 Innovation is making domestic payments increasingly convenient instantaneous and ubiquitous More options are available to consumers and this is making it more convenient for them to use digital payments Systems that offer near instant persontoperson retail payments are increasingly available around the world Many payment systems in the country now operate 24 hours a day seven days a week which are pushing customers towards digital payments on account of the convenience they offer India has Immediate Payment Systems IMPS and Unified Payments Interface UPI as fast payments and the latter is driving the retail payments volume In addition with NEFT which drives the retail payments value operationalised on a 24x7x365 basis with halfhourly settlements Indias payment systems landscape is headed for substantial growth 65 According to GlobalData a data and analytics company digital cash in India is poised for significant growth According to the 2017 Consumer Payments Insight Survey by the company India is one of the top markets globally in terms of digital cash adoption with 554 survey respondents indicating that they use it India is followed by China and Denmark The adoption level in India is much higher compared to many of the developed markets such as the US and the UK where consumers predominantly use cards b Digital Payments to GDP 66 The value of cash withdrawals at ATMs to GDP has remained constant in India at around 17 except during the demonetisation period when it fell to 15 When compared with other jurisdictions India is behind only to Nordic countries France Belgium UK and Australia which are known lesscash economies Even China which is ahead of most countries in terms of digital products and channels has a high 67 indicating a high velocity of cash 67 The value of digital payments to GDP increased from 660 in 201415 to 862 in 201819 making the shift to digital payments in India clearly perceptible A comparison with other CPMI countries shows that India is amongst the few countries like Argentina Brazil China South Korea Turkey and UK where the value of digital payments as a percentage of GDP has increased c Infrastructure 68 Infrastructure is the key requirement facilitating both cash dispensation and electronic payments While it is true that bank branches and ATMs facilitate cash transactions the former also facilitates the growth of electronic payments by bringing about financial inclusion and the latter acts as a confidence factor that cash is available at hand when required and as such there is no need to keep it stored in your wallet purse PoS terminals and mobile phones directly aid electronic transactions 69 The last 5 years have witnessed a growth of 35 in the number of branches of SCBs across the country The increase in branches especially in rural and semiurban areas has been an enabler for instilling banking practices in these areas which aids digital payments 610 As at December 2019 there were around 49 lakh PoS terminals across the country The ATMs and PoS terminals across the country have grown at a CAGR of 4 and 35 respectively over the past 5 years While the number of ATMs a cash infrastructure has grown at a low pace the growth of noncash infrastructure mainly depicted by PoS has been significant This has given a further fillip to digitisation 611 While India made considerable progress with reference to the absolute number of PoS terminals deployed the density of population dependent on a PoS terminal continues to be high at 358 While this is a drastic improvement from the 1124 persons per PoS terminal in 2014 other CPMI countries had a better deployment rate In order to increase the acceptance infrastructure the Reserve Bank has announced the operationalisation of an Acceptance Development Fund to increase acceptance infrastructure 612 Another important acceptance infrastructure gaining popularity is the digital PoS or the QR code Bharat QR has grown as a lightweight low cost method to bring merchants into the acceptance network The deployment of QR codes is expected to increase substantially in the coming years which along with physical PoS terminals will facilitate the rapid adoption of digital payments As on November 30 2019 over 16 million payment QR codes Bharat QR as well as proprietary QRs of other payment system operators were deployed A committee has been constituted by the Reserve Bank to examine review and finalise a panIndia interoperable QR code structure 7 Looking Glass 71 The factors inhibiting the digital push are connectivity issues inadequate acceptance infrastructure lack of familiarity with newer alternative payment methods delay in getting complaints resolved and security and privacy concerns Reserve Bank has acknowledged the same and to address these issues has put in place systems like consumer awareness programmes ombudsman schemes increasing the category of billers in Bharat Bill Pay etc 72 The Payments and Settlement Systems Vision 20192021 envisages empowering every citizen with an Exceptional e Payment Experience and provide her access to a bouquet of options To achieve this the Reserve Bank has a made NEFT available 24x7 with effect from December 16 2019 b mandated banks not to charge savings bank account customers for online transactions in the NEFT system with effect from January 2020 c permitted all authorised payment systems and instruments nonbank PPIs cards and UPI for linking with National Electronic Toll Collection NETC FASTags and d enabled processing of emandates for transactions through UPI However some areas still remain where action is envisaged such as a operationalising the Acceptance Development Fund to increase acceptance infrastructure b Assessing the need for plurality of QR codes and merits of their coexistence or convergence from both systemic and consumer viewpoints In addition RBI is conducting an innovation contest through the Institute of Development and Research in Banking Technology IDRBT These steps will further accelerate the adoption of digital payments 8 Conclusion 81 Both cash and noncash payment instruments fulfil unique needs and as long as these needs do not change both types of payment instruments are required to meet the full spectrum of users needs 82 Electronic payment methods are both at the service of and bound by Indias heterogeneous economic composition Virtual payments are increasing in popularity but the countrys ethnic and economic diversity render the shift toward digital payments geographically variable and certain regions and economic strata exhibit more openness to digitisation than others 83 Indias growing use of retail digital payments along with the radical reconstruction of its cash economy indicates a shift in its relationship with cash This is evidenced by the steep growth observed in the retail digital payments Increasing acceptance and convenience of digital payments visvis cash is also reflected in decrease in average value per digital payment transaction 84 A large population of the country historically lacked access to personal bank accounts and credit lines Digital payment methods AePS APBS DBT have played a large role in helping them manage their personal finances leading to their being financially included 85 Cash still rules but is increasingly seen as a way to store value as an economic asset rather than to make payments 86 Speed convenience and competition are shaping the future of payments Our endeavour is to make digital payments a divine experience to the users Cash is King but Digital is Divine February 24 2020 References i Hicks J 1969 Critical essays in monetary

https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/PublicationReportDetails.aspx?UrlPage=&ID=923,Date,Executive Summary The past decade has witnessed several innovations in retail payments across the globe including India Benchmarking Indias Payment Systems facilitates an assessment of Indias progress against payment systems and instruments in major countries and provides further impetus to the planned efforts for deepening the digitisation of payments 2 A comprehensive exercise for benchmarking Indias Payment Systems was undertaken by selecting a mix of 21 countries including advanced economy countries Asian economies and BRICS Brazil Russia India China and South Africa nations spread across all the continents where payment systems are considered robust diverse and efficient The countries include Australia Brazil Canada China France Germany Hong Kong India Indonesia Italy Japan Mexico Russia Saudi Arabia Singapore South Africa South Korea Sweden Turkey United Kingdom and the United States of America 2 Reserve Bank of India RBI has relied on publicly available information in this report and has made every effort to ensure that the information contained in the report is accurate 3 Payment Systems have been rated on the basis of categories which are as under a Leader ranked 1st or 2nd or 3rd b Strong in the top rungs of the countries other than the leaders 4th to 9th c Moderate ranked in the middle 10th to 15th and d Weak in the lowest rungs 16th to 21st 4 The benchmarking exercise aims to provide an understanding of the payment systems in place in India and how their usage preferences compare with other countries It is also a starting point for a meaningful analysis of the efficiency levels of Indias payment systems 5 The benchmarking has been done over a range of 21 areas and 41 indicators as indicated below A snapshot of Indias position details of which are in the report is as follows Benchmarking Indias Payment Systems 1 Background 11 An efficient payment system reduces the cost of exchanging goods and services and is indispensable to the smooth functioning of various markets especially interbank money and capital markets A weak payment system on the other hand may severely hamper the stability and developmental capacity of an economy its failures can result in inefficient use of financial resources inequitable risksharing among agents actual losses for participants and loss of confidence in the financial system and in the very use of money 12 For entities to stay at the top benchmarking is necessary to cope with the changes in the demographics politics economy and technology Benchmarking is a way of discovering the best performance being achieved in any area which in turn can be used to identify gaps in an organizations processes in order to improve its functioning 13 Indias Payment Systems are considered to be efficient safe and secure The payment and settlement systems are also adequately regulated and supervised Over the past decade a number of innovations have taken place in retail payments These have reshaped payment processes and changed the retail payments landscape by influencing users in their choice of payment instruments In addition the innovations and changes have lowered costs and have increased social welfare Benchmarking is an effective means of evaluating the efficiency of the payment systems in the country 2 Present Exercise 21 This exercise aims at benchmarking Indias Payment Systems and gauges Indias standing against twenty other countries across all payment systems and payment instruments It attempts to gain a perspective on the performance of India compared to other countries in the payment systems space It highlights strengths and weaknesses relative to comparable payments and usage trends in other countries The exercise therefore tries to a arrive at an understanding of preferences Indians have for making and receiving payments and how these preferences compare with other countries and b measure the efficiency of our payment systems 22 The data used for benchmarking is mostly for the years 2012 and 2017 In the last year or so the digital growth acceptance infrastructure and many other parameters in India have seen a sizeable jump Indias score is likely to be better when the data for all countries for 2018 is available for making a comparison 23 The current Benchmarking exercise is a first of its kind undertaken by the Reserve Bank future exercises shall be undertaken at frequent intervals and the parameters monitored on a continuous basis 3 Data Sources 31 The benchmarking draws on the following data sources BIS Red Book Country Tables compiled by the Bank for International Settlements BIS for the year ended 2017 published in March 2019 Worldpay Global Payments Report November 2018 RBI Data Survey conducted by the Working Group on Central Bank Involvement in Retail Payments 2012 constituted by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems CPSS BIS Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures CPMI Report on Fast payments Enhancing the speed and availability of retail payments November 2016 RTGS Survey by the RTGS Working Group to the CPMI 2012 Global Findex Survey 2017 conducted for World Bank World Bank World Development Indicators The Economist Intelligence Unit The 2018 Government EPayment Adoption Ranking Migration and Development Brief 30 2018 being finalised by KNOMAD World Bank Group 32 The format of this exercise has been drawn from the Research Paper Benchmarking New Zealands Payment Systems published in May 2016 33 Reserve Bank of India RBI has relied on publicly available information in this report and has made every effort to ensure that the information contained in the report is accurate 4 Selecting the countries to benchmark against 41 The BIS publishes statistics known as the Red Book statistics on payments and financial market infrastructures FMIs in member jurisdictions of the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures CPMI The Red Book contains data on 26 countries To improve readability and presentation and to make the analysis insightful the benchmarking is confined to 21 countries spread across all the continents where the payment systems are considered to be robust diverse and efficient 42 The countries included in the benchmarking exercise are a mix of advanced economies Asian economies and all the BRICS nations They are Australia Brazil Canada China France Germany Hong Kong India Indonesia Italy Japan Mexico Russia Saudi Arabia Singapore South Africa South Korea Sweden Turkey United Kingdom and the United States of America For the purpose of the indicators Regulations and Oversight European Central Bank ECB has also been included One striking feature of the countries selected is that most countries apart from India and Indonesia are characterised by high income or upper middle income in terms of World Bank socioeconomic indicators which would explain the relative position of countries on various parameters The countries which are present in the Red Book but excluded from the study are Argentina Belgium Netherlands Spain and Switzerland 5 Rating 51 The benchmarking has been done over a range of indicators from regulation of payment systems to payment instruments and infrastructure For each indicator the rationale for the rating with the practices followed by leaders is provided as an annex The rating categories are Leader ranked 1st or 2nd or 3rd Strong in the top rungs of the countries other than the leaders 4th to 9th Moderate ranked in the middle 10th to 15th and Weak in the lowest rungs 16th to 21st 6 Highlights This exercise gives an understanding of the systems in vogue in India for making and receiving payments and how their usage preferences compare with other countries It is also a starting point for a meaningful analysis of the efficiency levels of Indias payment systems A summary of the insights is given below 61 The scope of regulation in India extends to the whole gamut of payment systems instruments costs and services provided by banks and nonbanks 62 The relatively high level of cash in circulation offers scope for higher level of digitisation of payments 63 The growth in the volume of payment systems transactions has been strong and steady 64 There is a robust cheque clearing system The decline in cheques usage has however been slow 65 Credit and debit Cards are growing at a steady rate 66 There is an increase in Point of Sale PoS terminals including mobile terminals which however may not be enough to cater to the large population 67 Domestic Card Network RuPay showed an average growth till 2017 and picked up thereafter with the issue of RuPay debit cards largely by public sector banks 68 Strong Large Value and Fast Payment Systems are in place 69 eMoney growth and options of alternate payments are available 610 Low digital payment of utility bills Bharat Bill Payment System BBPS an integrated interoperable bill payment system which commenced live operations from October 12 2017 is expected to facilitate digital payment of utility bills like electricity telecom DirecttoHome DTH gas and water 611 Digital communications infrastructure in the form of a robust mobile network is growing strongly Broadband infrastructure however lags behind 612 India has implemented more concerted initiatives to facilitate Government epayments by the State and ereceipts to the State 613 Authentication standards in India are strong 614 India has a robust and well managed central counter party CCP system for Government securities settlement 615 A distinct Ombudsman Scheme for complaints relating to digital financial transactions is in existence from January 31 2019 616 The Oversight role is explicitly and implicitly laid down in the statute and the Reserve Bank is empowered with a wide variety of tools to carry out this function 617 The Crossborder payment transactions are slow when compared to domestic payments The alternatives available are few India continues to be a large recipient of personal remittances 7 Learning Points 71 The last few years more specifically since November 2016 have witnessed a sea change in the payments landscape with a large growth in digital payments There is an increased focus on speeding up payment processing both through faster payment initiation and faster settlement 72 Demonetization was implemented in India on the November 8 2016 withdrawing the legal tender status of Rs500 and Rs1000 notes This led to a push in the use of cheques and digital payments The digital push was sustained in 2017 73 Driven by efforts aimed at higher financial inclusion and adoption of mobile payments India recorded an accelerated growth rate of over 50 in the volume of retail electronic payment transactions in the last four years 71 65 51 and 95 in the financial years ended 201516 201617 201718 and 201819 respectively source RBI data The growth in 201819 was largely due to the steep growth in Unified Payments Interface UPI 74 Card debit and credit payment is an important payment instrument which has replaced the use of cash at least in retail outlets and ecommerce sites It may be noted that the level of credit card penetration in India is low when compared to advanced countries where it is a preferred option for making payments The usage behaviour in the financial year 201819 at PoS vs ATMs with reference to debit and credit cards is depicted in the following table 75 To encourage usage of cards card infrastructure is required to be robust strong and secure Further the last mile availability of PoS terminals is relatively lower in India and much needs to be done in this regard Mandating the issue and use of only EMV chip and PINbased cards has helped build public confidence as it provides more security than the Magstripe only cards 76 The turning point in digital payment system preferences relates to the fact that mobile phones are rapidly becoming personal electronic devices performing an increasing range of services including those relating to payments In India mobile infrastructure is expanding and financial inclusion has ensured that banking in the form of Basic Savings Bank Deposit BSBD accounts reaches the remotest part of the country 77 The role of nonbanks in retail payments has increased significantly owing in part to the growing use of innovative technology that allows nonbanks mostly fintech companies to compete in areas not yet dominated by banks 78 With the digital landscape exploding there is an urgent need for improved security and customer identification in electronic payments Consumers demand and expect equal measures of seamless ease and security in all aspects of their digital lives most of all when it comes to shopping and payments Consumer expectations for safe payments demand that merchants make secure user authentication as seamless as the act of payment 79 In India the smartphone revolution has seen an explosion in digital payment options from eMoney to the Unified Payments Interface UPI to a combination of the two After demonetization use of eMoney picked up on a very large scale The digital landscape changed with increase in the usage of eMoney UPI Aadhaar Payments Bridge System APBS RuPay Bharat Bill Payment System BBPS etc 710 Generally competition pushes market participants to increase efficiency In case market participants are unable to cope they are pushed out of the market Customers and service providers require solutions that are costefficient user friendly and safe In India not only are a bouquet of varied systems available but also healthy competition is an integral component 711 Aadhaar enabled eKYC electronic Know Your Customer had resulted in an exponential growth of digital payments in India 712 The most straightforward approach to have a digital push would be to target the generation which is most responsive to technology and digital age This heads down generation is ready to try out new payment systems channels as long as they perceive that the rewards are good 8 Benchmarking Summary Appendix Glossary Annex Benchmarking Assessment A Regulation 1 Laws in place and scope of regulation 11 Key insight The Reserve Banks scope for regulation extends to the whole gamut of payment systems except payment aggregators and instruments as also services provided by banks and nonbanks India is one of the few countries that has a specific Payment Systems Law which was enacted in 2007 to provide for the regulation and supervision of payment systems in India and to designate the RBI as the authority for the purpose and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto However in order to maintain public confidence in the payment systems entry and exit of operators is regulated in India unlike certain other jurisdictions 12 Benchmark Rating Strong 13 Analysis A sound and appropriate legal framework is generally considered the basis for an efficient payment systems The legal environment should include i laws and regulations of broad applicability that address issues such as insolvency and contractual relations between parties ii laws and regulations that have specific applicability to payment systems such as legislation on electronic signature validation of netting and settlement finality and iii the rules standards and procedures agreed by the participants of a payments system Regulation is therefore important for the development and orderly functioning of not only the financial services but also the payment systems India enacted the Payment and Settlement Systems Act in 2007 PSS Act which states that the payment and settlement systems serve as the backbone of financial system of the country The key task of the central bank inter alia is to maintain public confidence in money and in the instruments and systems used to represent money and means of its exchange Therefore given the significant public interest involved central banks involvement in payment and settlement systems encompass regulation and supervision operations and at times providing liquidity support to payment systems Central banks also act as a catalyst for development of robust payment systems Central banks are focussing more and more on promoting einclusion fostering fintechs and beefing up security and data protection regulations 2 Regulation of costs of payment systems 21 Key insight In India there exists a stipulation that the Merchant Discount Rate MDR should be borne by the merchant and not passed on to the customer To promote digital transactions the Central Government has been reimbursing bearing the MDR charges on transactions with values up to Rs2000 made through debit cards BHIM UPI and Aadhaarenabled payment system this facility is available till December 2019 The Reserve Bank has also prescribed the maximum charges that can be levied by banks for transactions undertaken through National Electronic Funds Transfer NEFT system and the Real Time Gross Settlement RTGS System 22 Benchmarking rating Leader 23 Analysis The cost of digital transactions is an inhibiting factor for the growth of digital transactions Merchants have to cash out or transfer to their banks accounts at a cost and at times these costs are passed on to the consumer A few countries have tried to regulate costs in order to ensure that the charges are not usurious but the jury is still out on whether such a regulation promotes the growth of digital payments as with banks pushing and merchants pulling it isnt clear if such caps will discourage use of cash Anecdotal evidence for countries which have intervened in costs shows that it has led to reduction of interchange fees higher acceptance of credit cards wider proliferation of NFC near field communication terminals introduction of new fees by schemes eg noncontactless payment fee and decreased revenue for card issuers with no indication that costs for consumers have decreased United States Caps 005022 Exemptions credit cards small issuers commercial cards Methodology Cost Plus Canada Caps 15 weighted average for Visa Master card credit Exemptions zero interchange for local debit card network Methodology NA China Caps 035 for debit cards 045 for credit cards Methodology Unknown Australia Caps weighted average of 05 for credit cards weighted average of 008 for debit cards Methodology Cost Plus India Merchant Discount Rate MDR In India the interchange rate is not prescribed by the regulator However ceilings on MDR was introduced in 2012 The present MDR prescribed is given below Caps a For merchants with turnover 20 lakh 04 for physical POS infrastructure including online card transactions 03 for QR Code based transactions up to a max of Rs200 b For merchants with turnover 20 lakh 09 for physical POS infrastructure including online card transactions 08 for QR code based transactions up to a max of Rs1000 Exemptions credit cards Methodology NA EU Caps Credit card 03 of the transaction value Debit card 02 of the transaction value Exemptions Commercial cards Payment cards issued by three party payment card schemes Methodology Merchant Indifference Test MIT Maximum Multilateral Interchange Fee MIF B Cash 3 Cash in Circulation per capita 31 Key insight India with cash equivalent USD 218 per capita in 2017 scores highly over even developed countries with regard to low per capita cash in circulation While it is a fact that a high numerator is divided over a high denominator the per capita availability of cash is quite low when compared to most countries 32 Benchmarking rating Strong 33 Analysis This indicator measures cash or currency in circulation per inhabitant This indicator may also be a proxy for low income levels Currency or cash in circulation is a currency that is physically used to conduct transactions between consumers and businesses rather than stored in a bank financial institution or central bank It is the cash issued by the central bank less cash holdings with banks This includes both Banknotes in circulation and coins in circulation In 2012 India had lowest cash in circulation at USD 174 per inhabitant and Indonesia was next lowest at USD 186 per inhabitant The cash per inhabitant continues to be low for India 4 Cash in Circulation as percent of GDP 41 Key insight India is in the middle with reference to amount of cash in active circulation relative to GDP 107 in the year 2017 This contrasts with the earlier parameter in as much as cash handled by the population is not commensurate with their income levels While India had a rapidly shrinking cash level in 2017 as compared to 2012 other countries with the exception of Brazil China Indonesia Russia South Africa and Sweden had increasing cash levels Although cash is deeply embedded in the payment systems in India planned efforts postdemonetisation have shown that shift from cash to digital can be achieved 42 Benchmarking rating Moderate 43 Analysis This indicator measures cash in circulation as a percentage of GDP In 2012 India had a high cash in circulation at 1159 of GDP with only Japan and Hong Kong being higher data for Germany presumably a high cash economy is not available Demonetisation and an active growth in GDP brought down the active cash in circulation as a percentage of GDP to 870 in 2016 which increased to 1070 in 2017 The amount of cash in circulation is indirectly related to the use of cash as a payment instrument It is assumed that having high cash in circulation relative to GDP indicates cash is preferred as a payment instrument Based on this assumption India continues to have a strong bias for cash payments C Payment Systems Transactions 5 Payment systems transaction volume and growth 51 Key insight The volume of payment transactions in India grew strongly and steadily at a CAGR of 40 between 2012 and 2017 showing an appetite for modes of payment other than cash Payment systems volume grew at rates faster than India only in China Indonesia and Saudi Arabia The payment system transactions in 2017 grew by 448 over the previous year over a strong yearonyear growth of 564 in 2016 even after cash availability normalised after demonetisation showing that noncash payments were slowly becoming a habit for the users This is also demonstrated by the growth of 543 in the financial year 201819 over the previous financial year 52 Benchmarking rating Moderate 53 Analysis Throughout human history payment methods have evolved From livestock to gold coins cash to cheques plastic credit cards to eMoney the journey of payments evolves from the concrete to the abstract One of the factors that drive the development of an economy is the presence of secure convenient accessible and affordable payment systems Payment instruments in India are varied starting from the paperbased payment instruments to electronic payment instruments debit cards credit cards and eMoney Payment Systems transactions include the total transactions undertaken by all payment systems in the country In India this includes a Paper Clearing CTS Non MICR b Large Value RTGS c Retail Electronic Clearing ECS NACH NEFT d Fast Payments IMPS UPI f Card Payments Credit and Debit Card and g eMoney PPI Cards and Wallets In terms of volume USA is far above other countries and India is growing at a fast clip 6 Value of payment systems transactions to cash in circulation 61 Key insight The payment systems transactions at 780 times the cash in circulation in the year 2017 establishes that India has a moderately strong bias for cash payments The ratio in 2016 was 909 as demonetisation led to an increase in the ratio more due to nonavailability of cash rather than due to a shift in preference 62 Benchmarking rating Moderate 63 Analysis The demand for cash remains robust around the world India is ranked 11 amongst 16 countries for which data is available data is not available for cash preferred economies like Japan and Germany Cash like other forms of money is used both as a means of payment and a store of value While good progress have been made in developing alternate modes of payment demand for cash continues for various reasons However this also offers scope for giving further push to efforts at digitizing payments D Cheques 7 Rate of decline of cheques 71 Key insight While India was far behind the United States in the volume of cheques the decline rate in India was the lowest Only Turkey posted a decline lower than India CAGR of 1 between 2012 and 2017 The slow decline in India in the years 2016 and 2017 was because use of cheques increased in the wake of demonetisation 72 Benchmarking rating Weak 73 Analysis In most countries cheques have disappeared or are dying a slow death Indias cheque volume declined by 108 between 2012 and 2017 at a CAGR of 2 The United States of America and Brazil which had a higher volume of cheques in 2012 showed a sharper decline In India the year on year growth in 2016 was 101 which can be attributed to demonetisation where all modes of payment showed an increase 2017 however saw a small decline of 29 over the previous year 8 Cheques volume vs payment systems volume 81 Key insight Indias share of cheque volume relative to all payment instruments was high at 73 in the year 2017 keeping it at the bottom of the pile with respect to the countries benchmarked However the share reduced to 46 in 201819 82 Benchmarking rating Weak 83 Analysis Across the board cheque volumes have dropped significantly compared to all other payment instruments We can place the examined countries into three groups those that are close to eliminating cheques Australia China Germany Indonesia Saudi Arabia South Africa South Korea Sweden and Turkey those that are rapidly reducing cheque usage but still have some way to go Brazil Canada Italy Singapore and United Kingdom and those that still have high cheque usage United States France Mexico and India India is steadily reducing the volume of cheques relative to all other payment instruments In 2012 cheques made up 435 of all Indias payment systems volumes including all debit and credit card transactions direct debits credit transfers and eMoney Six years later this had dropped to 73 However India still has considerable ground to cover to catch up with countries that are close to being cheque free 9 Cheque instrument features 91 Key insight India has a robust cheque clearing system with a T1 settlement across the country This ensured that the economy did not suffer on account of payment and settlement issues when the major mode of settlement viz cash was not in adequate supply 92 Benchmark rating Leader 93 Analysis In India the cheque processing system is fast and efficient We have a T1 settlement and the cheques processing is mechanised Standardisation of cheque forms and cheque truncation system CTS were the key factors that enabled mechanisation of cheque processing Benchmarks like quality of paper watermark banks logo in invisible ink void pantograph etc and standardisation of field placements on cheques have been prescribed towards achieving standardisation of cheques issued by banks In truncation instead of the physical cheque an electronic image of the cheque is transmitted to the paying branch through the clearing house along with relevant information like data on the MICR band date of presentation presenting bank etc This effectively eliminates the associated cost of movement of the physical cheques reduces the time required for their collection and brings efficiency to the entire activity of cheque processing E Debit and Credit Cards 10 Number of debit and credit cards issued 101 Key insight India is second only to China in terms of number of debit cards issued and is a leader in growth For credit cards while the growth levels are good and better than all the benchmarked countries the number of credit cards issued is not very significant when compared to the group 102 Benchmarking rating Debit Cards Leader Credit Cards Moderate 103 Analysis As at the end of the year 2012 India had 33160 million and 1955 million debit and credit cards respectively which grew to 86170 million and 3749 million respectively as at the end of the year 2017 As on March 31 2019 the number of debit and credit cards issued were 925 million and 47 million respectively In respect of debit cards India is second only to China An interesting fact is that while the debit cards issued were 86170 million as per the socioeconomic profile Table 25C only 33 of the population reported having a debit card in 2017 This could be because of some persons having multiple cards and others none In credit cards while the growth is strong and better than all the benchmarked countries there is still a lot of catching up to do so far as total number of cards is concerned The reasons for low credit card usage in India are a demand where Indian households are traditionally oriented towards savings b supply with a majority of the labour force occupied in the unorganised sector with the card issuers in all probability unwilling to take higher credit risks and c the Indian ethos to pay for goods and services on purchase instead of running up credit lines 11 Share of debit and credit cards in payment systems Volume 111 Key insight Debit and Credit cards made up 299 of Indias payment systems volume in the year 2017 Based on the mix of the countries benchmarked India is in the lower rung and ranks higher than only Germany and Indonesia In terms of volume however India was moderate with a strong CAGR Table 14 As per the data available with the Reserve Bank Indias debit and credit card share was 25 of the payment systems volume in the financial year 201819 112 Benchmarking rating Weak 113 Analysis The world over people are using cards for making payments more frequently and even for smaller transactions Indias credit and debit card transactions while lower than most countries had a remarkable CAGR of 40 between 2012 and 2017 Table 14 The growth was driven in part by more people holding debit and credit cards and growth in the number of point of sale PoS terminals 12 Point of Sale PoS Terminals Deployed 121 Key insight India had made considerable progress in deployment of PoS terminals and the number is higher than all countries with the exception of Brazil and China Over the period between 2012 and 2017 India had a CAGR of 29 which is next only to Chinas CAGR of 34 122 Benchmarking rating Strong 123 Analysis In terms of absolute number of PoS terminals India evidenced a strong position with 3083000 PoS terminals in service as at the end of the year 2017 Between 2012 and 2017 China India Russia and Saudi Arabia have shown a strong growth As on March 31 2019 the number of PoS terminals in service in India was 3722229 13 People per PoS Terminals 131 Key insight Although India had made considerable progress with reference to the absolute number of PoS terminals deployed it has a long way to go for reaching them out to its population 132 Benchmarking rating Weak 133 Analysis While India ranks highly in terms of number of PoS terminals deployed its ranking is weak in terms of availability of PoS terminals to consumers India had 3083000 PoS terminals in service at the end of the year 2017 which equates to 427 people for each terminal which improved significantly from 1446 people for a terminal in 2012 14 Debit and Credit Card Payments 141 Key insight India is slowly and steadily moving away from cash for making payments at retail outlets The volume of card payments grew by a CAGR of 40 from 880 million transactions in 2012 to 4799 million transactions in 2017 142 Benchmarking rating Moderate 143 Analysis While Indias performance was better than Germany Italy Indonesia Mexico Singapore South Africa Saudi Arabia Sweden and Turkey it lags far behind China Russia Brazil UK and USA in this aspect F Cash vs Debit and Credit Cards 15 Debit and Credit Card payments vs currency in circulation 151 Key insight India is at the lower rung of the benchmarked countries in respect of the value of debit and credit card spending relative to the cash in circulation 152 Benchmarking rating Weak 153 Analysis Indias debit and credit card payments is 05 times the cash in circulation This is one of the lowest ratios amongst the benchmarked countries The result is a combination of India having high levels of cash and low card usage Indonesia and Japan have ratios comparable with that of India G Cash and Automated Teller Machines ATMs 16 ATMs Deployed 161 Key insight India is next only to China in terms of the number of ATMs deployed and it also had a strong CAGR of 14 during the period between 2012 and 2017 While this is good from customer service perspective it also depicts a high demand for cash 162 Benchmarking rating Leader 163 Analysis As at the end of the year 2017 India had 222300 ATMs and was second only to China which had 961000 ATMs As on March 31 2019 the number of ATMs in India dropped to 221703 17 People per ATM 171 Key Insight Like PoS terminals although India has made considerable progress with reference to the absolute number of ATMs deployed it has a long way to go for reaching them out to its population All countries in the benchmarked group have a better deployment rate The silver lining however is that the availability has doubled over the six year period between 2012 and 2017 with dependency reducing from 10832 persons per ATM in 2012 to 5919 persons per ATM in 2017 172 Benchmarking rating Weak 173 Analysis India is a cash dependent economy While the number of ATMs available is second only to China as mentioned earlier deployment of more ATMs erspecially in the semiurban and rural areas are necessary to serve a large population 18 Count of Cash withdrawal at ATMs per capita 181 Key insight In 2017 Indians attained a low 7 ATM withdrawals per person which was better than all the benchmarked countries While this ratio normally indicates less cash dependency the truth is that in India access to ATMs is low numerator and the population is high denominator hence a good ratio In addition there is a limit on the number of times cash can be withdrawn from ATMs in a month without any charges which acts as a deterrence at times 182 Benchmarking rating Leader 183 Analysis This ratio is also an indicator of the cash dependency of the economy In terms of number of annual ATM withdrawals per capita Indias 2017 level is better than countries which are less dependent on cash than India Cash dependency increased in most countries except Australia France Germany Singapore Sweden and UK which had reduced withdrawals The large increase in cash withdrawal in India can also be attributed to demonetisation in late 2016 where people had to go to the ATMs frequently on account of the limits imposed on a single withdrawal In Sweden going cashless is the norm especially in large cities Purchases are done through cards or digital medium like Swedens most popular payment app Swish Many restaurants have stopped accepting cash Busses and trains do not accepts notes and coins This did not cause an adverse reaction in Sweden as everybody had an alternate payment system Sweden being a pioneer in digital technology has facilitated its move to a cashless society Strong broadband coverage even in remote areas and a tech savvy population have also contributed The dependence on cash can be done away in India only when an alternate is made available to each and every person and the infrastructure is expanded 19 ATM Withdrawal vs cash in circulation 191 Key insight India has one of the lowest ratios of ATM cash withdrawal relative to cash in circulation This is because of the high level of cash in circulation low percapita availability of ATMs 5919 people per ATM in the year 2017 refer Table 17 and restriction on number of free withdrawals It is also an indicator of low efficiency in recycling cash ie the cycle withdrawing cash making payments with it and in turn making deposits through the banking system 192 Benchmarking rating Weak 193 Analysis The value of withdrawal from ATMs is 16 times the amount of cash in circulation This takes off from the earlier analysis at indicator 6 para 63 about the uses of cash as means of payment and as a store value In India ATMs dispense higher denomination notes H Domestic Card Networks 20 Presence of Domestic Card network and its share 201 Key insight India with Rupay launched in 2012 is a late entrant in the market In 2017 the share of Rupay was 15 of the total cards issued in India It is reported that about 586 million RuPay cards have been issued as of March 31 2019 by nearly 1100 banks giving it more than 50 share in the countrys debit cards issued The drive for a less cash economy in the wake of demonetisation and issue of RuPay cards for basic savings bank deposit BSBD accounts promoted usage of RuPay cards in the interiors of the country where paying with a card was a novelty just five years back 202 Benchmarking rating Moderate 203 Analysis Many types of payments usually done with cash are moving electronic Countries that encourage domestic cards have been faster in moving away from cash The use of domestic cards in various countries in the year 2017 is given in Table 19 To increase its acceptance around the world RuPay has tied up with other payment networks like UnionPay China JCB Japan NETS Singapore BCCard South Korea Elo Brazil and DinaCard Serbia in addition to Discover and DinerClub France and Germany have more than 90 domestic cards usage Countries where the domestic cards are widely used promote their networks and have tie ups with Visa and Master only for international transactions I Credit Transfers 21 Volume and growth of Credit Transfers 211 Key insight Indias credit transfer volumes are strong when compared with the benchmarked countries It has also exhibited leading growth with a CAGR of 60 between 2012 and 2017 and a year on year growth of 529 in 2017 The growth can be attributed to the robust working of wellestablished credit transfer systems 212 Benchmarking rating Strong 213 Analysis Credit transfers are payment instruments based on payment orders or sequences of payment orders made for the purpose of placing funds at the disposal of the payee In India this can be undertaken using RTGS NEFT ECS Credit NACH Credit IMPS and UPI Aggregate credit transfer volumes of majority of the benchmarked countries grew at less than 10 over the previous year with the exception of China India Indonesia Mexico Saudi Arabia Singapore and Turkey China India and Singapore as evidenced in the later parameters have robust RTGS and fast payment systems 22 Share of Credit Transfers Volume in payment systems 221 Key insight With an efficient credit transfer system in place India was 2nd amongst the benchmarked countries in the year 2017 with reference to the share of credit transfers in the payment systems 222 Benchmarking rating Leader 223 Analysis While Indonesia is the leader Brazil Germany Mexico and Sweden also have a reasonable share of credit transfers in the payment systems Indias share has grown from 194 in 2012 to 383 in 2017 due to reasons stated in the earlier indicator J Large Value Payments 23 Real Time Gross Settlement RTGS 231 Key Insight RTGS which is owned and operated by the Reserve Bank of India started functioning in 2004 this was upgraded in 2013 when India became the first country to use ISO 20022 standard for RTGS messages The RTGS offers direct and indirect access to participants and also offers access to intraday liquidity to eligible participants 232 Benchmarking rating Strong 233 Analysis Largevalue systems are the most significant component of the national payment systems This is because largevalue systems are capable of generating and transmitting disturbances of a systemic nature to the financial sector Large Value Payment Systems are therefore systemically important financial market infrastructure and critical for smooth functioning of the financial system RTGS systems contribute to the reduction of settlement risk in securities and foreign exchange transactions by facilitating the delivery versus payment DVP and payment versus payment PVP mechanisms for settlement of funds leg in INR Variants of the basic RTGS system the socalled hybrid systems that take into account liquiditysaving features that exist in net settlement systems have been introduced in some of the benchmarked countries including India over the years Domestically located banks domestically located nonbanks domestically located brokerdealer domestically located FMIs and foreign branches located in the jurisdiction have direct access to RTGS in India RTGS can be accessed through webbased portal and proprietary network In addition transactions can also be initiated physically at participants locations These features make the system robust and have led to its acceptability and usability The system is however not available 247 and there is no technical interoperability with other systems K Fast Payments 24 Channels in which fast payments are available 241 Key insight India is one of the few countries which has fast payment systems in the form of IMPS and UPI IMPS stared functioning as early as 2010 and scores over fast payment systems in other countries as it is available through all the channels online mobile physical and IVR UPI which was introduced in 2016 has the convenience of not requiring the need for providing card numbers IFSC codes or account numbers for transactions IMPS also 242 Benchmarking rating Strong 243 Analysis Payment systems are becoming faster and more convenient Fast payments can be defined by two key features speed and continuous service availability Based on these features fast payments can be defined as payments in which the transmission of the payment message and the availability of final funds to the payee occur in real time or nearreal time and are available on as near to a 24hour and 7day 247 basis as possible The concept of fast payment systems is not new Amongst the benchmarked countries Japan and South Korea have had payment systems with some fast payment capabilities for years and they continue to enhance these systems to meet the demand of end users In India there are over 1 billion mobile subscriptions as at the end of the year 2018 Leveraging this high mobile density many payment service providers PSPs utilise mobile payment apps to link underlying payment instruments such as bank accounts or eMoney with mobile phone numbers for fast payments To include users with nonsmartphone devices an interoperable platform based on the Unstructured Supplementary Service Data USSD channel connecting all the telecom service providers in the country has also been implemented The subscribers use a single code 99 to access this service to make P2P payments via the UPI In addition the Unified Payment Interface UPI system brings a complete interoperability for merchant payments as well as P2P payments The UPI enables users to link their bank accounts with their mobile phone numbers through an application provided by the service providers and obtain a virtual address which can be used for making and receiving payments L Direct Debits 25 Volume and growth of Direct Debits and Growth 251 Key insight In the year 2017 Indias direct debit was ranked 12th out of the 17 benchmarked countries for which data is available which was lower than the 2nd position out of 21 benchmarked countries in respect of credit transfers The growth however was good 252 Benchmarking rating Weak 253 Analysis Direct debits are payment instruments based on preauthorised debits possibly recurrent of the payers account by the payee In India this comprises of ECS Debit and NACH Debit While the volumes in India are low the growth is next only to Saudi Arabia Direct debit typically has been an alternate to cheques for repetitive payments due to its convenience 26 Share of Direct Debits in payment systems 261 Key insight Indias share of direct debits in payment systems was low at 30 in the year 2017 It may also be noted that other forms of alternate payments have picked up and are being preferred over direct debits 262 Benchmarking rating Weak 263 Analysis Direct debits as a mode of payment are mainly preferred in countries where larger percentage of population saves in financial institutions Australia UK USA and Korea Other benchmark countries have been orienting towards other modes of payments M eMoney 27 Availability of alternate payments for retail transactions 271 Key insight India has developed a number of alternate payment channels Although behind China India has a decent 26 of online transactions using eMoney It is far above other developed countries where cards especially credit cards are predominantly used In India on account of epayments the financial system has leapfrogged the use of cards and moved to epayments in large numbers 272 Benchmarking rating Leader 273 Analysis New electronic payment epayment services are emerging which are increasingly instant ubiquitous and available around the clock Electronic payments boost economic growth while advancing financial inclusion For these reasons countries are working to make payment systems less dependent on cash and there is a thrust to move towards a cashless society with countries embarking on a cashless journey The most straightforward approach to have a digital push would be to target the generation which is most responsive to technology and digital age Since India has a large population of Millennium Children or Generation Y individuals born between 1982 and 2004 the aptitude for digital products is large and possibly larger than countries such as Japan and Europe which have an aging population This generation is also ready to try out new payment systems channels as long as the rewards are good The key reasons for acceptance of digital payments in India are enumerated in Table 27B Payment service providers PSPs can therefore personalise rewards beyond cashbacks to comarket with merchants and create loyalty programmes Such incentive programmes help in driving and sustaining mass adoption and engagement 28 Volume and growth of eMoney 281 Key insight With 3459 million eMoney transactions India was behind only Japan and USA data on China not available in 2017 with respect to volume of eMoney transactions The availability of various alternate payment systems has helped its growth 282 Benchmarking rating Strong 283 Analysis eMoney is prepaid value stored electronically which represents a liability of the emoney issuer a bank an emoney institution or any other entity authorised or allowed to issue emoney in the local jurisdiction and which is denominated in a currency backed by an authority In India Prepaid Payment Instruments are issued as Wallets and Cards Singapore has a significant number of prepaid cards including prepaid credit cards which is reported in Red Book as eMoney and not under cards Sweden had a growth of 908 in 2016 due to expanding digital transactions and nonacceptability of cash as a mode of payment at most places as detailed in indicator 18 According to GlobalData a data and analytics company the eMoney in India is poised for significant growth as Indian consumers are increasingly turning away from cash and card According to the 2017 Consumer Payments Insight Survey by the company India is one of the top markets globally in terms of eMoney adoption with 554 survey respondents indicating that they have eMoney and use it India is followed by China and Denmark The adoption level in India is much higher compared to many of the developed markets such as the US and the UK where consumers predominantly use cards Demonetization in November 2016 was a gamechanger for eMoney as people switched to electronicmodes of payments resulting in a year on year growth of 1625 in the year 2016 While medium to largevalue transactions continue to be made through digital banking channels and cheques the lowvalue daytoday transactions shifted to eMoney The growth in 2017 was 120 showing its sustenance and a perceptible shift towards eMoney 29 eMoney share in payment systems 291 Key insight India has made a significant progress by increasing the share of eMoney in the payment systems from 08 in 2012 to 103 in 2016 and 215 in 2017 While demonetisation gave the necessary fillip the availability of mobile infrastructure and alternate payment systems ensured that payment systems were not affected when cash was in short supply 292 Benchmarking rating Leader 293 Analysis Although data for China is not available in the Red Book as seen in Table 27A Chinese customers have adopted eMoney like no other nation and the trend does not appear to be slowing Singapores techsavvy culture and high smart phone adoption rate has helped in changing the payment habits of individuals In India while consumers have benefited from convenient payment option and pricing benefits cashback discounts it is the costeffectiveness that appeals to the merchants as the cost associated with eMoney acceptance including settingup infrastructure and transaction fees is much lower compared to traditional cardbased payment system N Digital Utility Payments 30 Digital Payment of Utility Bills 301 Key Insights Only 3 of the population in India used the internet to pay utility bills in the year 2017 There is scope for increased adoption in this sphere of activity refer Table 25C 302 Benchmarking rating Weak 303 Analysis The mobile connection are growing at a rapid pace For every 100 Indians there were 8728 cellular phones in the year 2017 293 million Basic Savings Bank Deposit BSBD Accounts opened since 2014 is a testimony of the penetration of financial inclusion However the challenge is to find a meeting point for the two Indias performance is abysmally low with reference to using digital means to pay utility bills and accessing financial institution through mobile and or broadband Indias standing will improve when banks take advantage of the digital explosion and offer safe and secure payment and remittance options to all their account holders 31 Public Mass Transportation 311 Key insight The National Common Mobility Card also known as One Nation One Card is an interoperable transport card conceived by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs of the Government of India This card would help the cities and people in the task of management and settlement of payment for public transport The card is an open system which can be used in a bus train and metro etc and will promote digital transaction while using public transport 312 Benchmark Rating Weak 313 Analysis The ticketing system of public mass transportation is a key feature for ensuring customer convenience The efficiency of the system is measured through a availability of travel chip card for several types of public transport b possibility of remote topup c availability of mobile ticketing d possibility to buy ticket chip card using a bank card e possibility to use contactless cards and mobile applications directly at pay gates e possibility to pay for nontransport services using chip card The ticketing systems of public mass transportation are observed to be more city specific than widespread across a country The leading cities in this regard are Tokyo Shanghai Singapore Beijing Hong Kong and Moscow In Hong Kong the advanced ticketing system Octopus chip card is used by 99 of the residents Singapore uses the EZlink card a unified contactless storedvalue card introduced for public transport in 2002 to ensure convenience and flexibility of the Singaporean ticketing system In Moscow while mobile ticketing is an alternative payment option PayPass Apple Pay Android Pay are also being introduced Delhi government started a trial of common mobility card which can be used in both Delhi Transport Corporation DTC busses and the metro Kochi Metro Rail Ltd KMRL was the first in the country where the entire public transport systems like bus metro and auto rickshaws use a single common card Kolkata started with Oyster a multipurpose card system for all transactions India however has a long road to travel O Digital Infrastructure 32 Mobile and broadband subscriptions 321 Key insight The growth of infrastructure in India has been phenomenal over the past six years especially with reference to availability of Mobile Cellular Subscriptions Only China in terms of connections per million inhabitants has evidenced faster growth With increased penetration of 3G and 4G even in remote areas the internet network is rapidly expanding in India and provides a threshold of Digital Revolution There are however connectivity issues which need to be addressed 322 Benchmarking rating Strong 323 Analysis The ways in which we pay for things has changed more in the past 15 years than in the previous 150 and nearly every innovation we have seen has taken a share away from cash Access to and uptake of new technology and innovation and the quality of infrastructure are important for ensuring safe and quick payments which help in building confidence in the payment systems The recent developments in Information and Communication Technology ICT in general and mobile technology in particular have provided a solid platform for building a new generation of payment technology While Indias performance has been good in terms of mobile infrastructure the same cannot be said about broadband However since internet for financial transactions is majorly accessed through mobiles Indias rating is considered as strong There is nothing to stop the country from becoming a leader in this area in case the connectivity improves and is available all over the country P Government ePayments 331 Overall 3311 Key Insight As per the Government EPayment Adoption Ranking report despite the fact that India has less than adequate infrastructure an average category score of 301 versus 442 across all countries as well as less sophisticated social economic context it performs well on all other four epayment pillars pushing it to a high rank of 28 India along with Brazil ranked 17th and South Africa ranked 42nd have implemented more concerted initiatives to facilitate epayments to and from the State China ranked 48th has witnessed a boom in commercial epayments but C2G and G2C electronic transaction services are lower 3312 Benchmark Rating Moderate 3313 Analysis Government payments play a critical role in the development of a national payment system especially in developing economies Government payments can facilitate economic growth and innovation in the underlying payment system infrastructure and enhance public policy goals such as efficiency transparency security of payments as well as financial inclusion The global epayments ecosystem continues to evolve at a staggering pace as traditional concepts of finance personal identity and trust are toppled by technological advances Governments have been trying to strike a balance between epayments advantage of increased efficiency in tax collection and social services expenditure and their possible risks Indias ranking improved from 36 in 2011 to 28 in 2018 Part of the reason for Indias progress is the sea change in identity assessment with the introduction of the Aadhaar biometric identity system in 2009 With almost 12 billion Indians more than 99 of the countrys adult population enrolled in Aadhaar it is recognised as the worlds largest biometric identity system The Economist Intelligence Unit in its 2018 Government EPayments Adoption Ranking has ranked India 28th amongst 75 countries and termed Indias performance as Intermediate 332 Citizen to Government C2G 3321 Key insight As per the Government EPayments Adoption Ranking report Indias performance is exceptional with reference to payments platform functionality for transaction services pension contributions obtaining paying for an ID card private transit costs and public transit payments and very strong with reference to income tax payments 3322 Benchmarking rating Leader 3323 Analysis This indicator captures the extent to which individuals can complete various transactions through an egovernment platform France and UAE the latter not included in this exercise top the C2G category reflecting their longstanding commitments to facilitate multiple public services through epayments and broadening citizen access to them through numerous channels Some of the areas where France and UAE lead are the existence of a single online and mobile access point for government services and the ease of obtaining and paying for an identification card Some countries are surging ahead by emulating best practices in a targeted costefficient way or by innovating to meet their needs The progress achieved by India and Russia both of which are tied for third place constitutes a remarkable jump from joint 41st in the C2G category in 2011 Indias performance is reflective of some older initiatives such as a fully electronic pension platform the National Pension System portal or eNPS and also of newer ones such as the development of an online portal to begin the process of obtaining an ID card In Mumbai the traffic police introduced in 2016 an electronic system to automate the issuance and payment of fines for traffic violations In addition constables in Mumbai have been equipped with handheld devices through which spot fines can be issued and paid immediately via payment cards or eMoney Although numerous implementation challenges remain other Indian cities are already planning to emulate the system The Economist Intelligence Unit in its 2018 Government EPayments Adoption Ranking has ranked India 3rd along with Russia Australia and Hong Kong amongst 75 countries 333 Government to Citizen G2C 3331 Key insight As per the Government EPayments Adoption Ranking report Indias performance is exceptional with reference to income tax refunds pension benefits and government social security payments online but is below average in disbursing unemployment benefits 3332 Benchmarking rating Moderate 3333 Analysis This indicator captures whether various government transfers to individuals can be completed through an egovernment platform Programmes such as Brazils Bolsa Familia and Indias Aadhaar while not without their risks and limitations have become case studies for governmenttocitizen transfers and national digital identification respectively One of Aadhaars early goals was to improve the efficiency of state aid by linking welfare and other transfers to the unique 12digit ID numbers tagged to biometric markers Aadhaar as claimed by the government reduced leakage from the system for example through graft by middlemen and saved USD 8bn in subsidy payments in two and a half years It is claimed that hundreds of thousands of fake beneficiaries have been expunged The Economist Intelligence Unit in its 2018 Government EPayments Adoption Ranking has ranked India 25th amongst 75 countries and termed its performance as Mature 334 Business to Government B2G 3341 Key insight As per the Government EPayments Adoption Ranking report India scores exceptionally in all the parameters assessed under the indicator viz business income tax payments VAT sales tax now GST payments business pension contributions company registration and payment of fees 3342 Benchmarking rating Leader 3343 Analysis This indicator captures the extent to which business can complete various transactions through egovernment platforms Governments around the world have been most proactive about facilitating their own revenues In particular almost 90 of governments provide electronic facilities for the filing of income and sales taxes and for the registration of businesses The Economist Intelligence Unit in its 2018 Government EPayments Adoption Ranking has ranked India as a joint leader along with several advanced economies 335 Government to Business Payments G2B 3351 Key insight As per the Government EPayments Adoption Ranking report India scores very highly for business income tax refunds VAT sales tax refunds payments for goods and services and disbursement of loans In India the tax calculation tracking and refund process is electronic 3352 Benchmarking rating Leader 3353 Analysis This indicator captures the extent to which various government transfers to business can be completed on an egovernment platform There are several developed countries that perform poorly in this indicator Some countries allow for epayments of tax refunds but do not offer businesses an easy way to calculate their refunds or check their status In others such as the UK although the public procurement portal lists tenders it does not facilitate payments tracking In some countries such as the UAE applications for government loans require facetoface interaction The Economist Intelligence Unit in its Government EPayments Adoption Ranking has ranked India as a joint leader along with Brazil Norway France and Hungary amongst 75 countries Q Aggregators 34 Third Party Payment Service Providers Payment Gateways Payment Aggregators 341 Key insight In India there is no direct regulation of the third party payment service providers while indirect regulation which has been serving well does exist However the central bank has issued directions for opening and operation of accounts and settlement of payments for electronic payment transactions involving intermediaries to ensure the safe and orderly conduct of these transactions The Reserve Bank has been examining the need and feasibility of regulating Payment Gateway Service Providers and Payment Aggregators It may be added that not regulating payment aggregators removes them from the ambit of the Digital Ombudsman 342 Benchmark Rating Moderate 343 Analysis Third Party Payment Service Providers Payment Gateways Payment Aggregators are service providers who process the payment transactions of ecommerce merchants Aggregators allow merchants to accept card and bank transfers without having to set up a merchant account with a bank or a card association The regulations relating to Third Party Payment Service Providers Payment Gateways Payment Aggregators are pertaining to specific areas such as i Licensing Authorisation ii Requirements for operation iii Security of online payments iv Settlement of funds and v Customer protection Direct regulation of Third Party Payment Service Providers is in place in China Brazil Japan and South Korea However in countries such as India and Singapore there is no direct regulation of payment intermediaries In countries where regulation is in place there are requirements for minimum levels of realized capital IT facilities organizational structure reserves and data storage Further some countries have prescribed some restrictions for storing accessing transmitting or performing transactions using sensitive customer information With regard to settlement of funds some countries have no restrictions South Korea USA Brazil and Europe China requires payment aggregators or intermediaries to not settle funds from their own bank account while Japan requires payment aggregators and payment intermediaries to hold funds from Merchant Consumer in a trust escrow in a designated bank account arrange bank guarantee deposit the amount to the designated Government Depository In India it is required that the accounts of payment intermediaries are opened and maintained by banks for facilitating collection of payments and that such accounts are not maintained or operated by the intermediaries R Customer Protection and Complaint Redress 35 Customer safety and Authentication Standards 351 Key Insight India has a framework on Limiting Liability of Customers in Unauthorised Electronic Banking Transactions In addition the Reserve Bank has also mandated a positive confirmation for RTGS NEFT and IMPS b two factor authentication for card transactions and c alerts on debit to bank accounts and eMoney India along with China is one of the few countries to have launched its two factor authentication system Rupays PaySecure The other systems in use today are Mastercard Visas 3DSecure and UnionPays SecurePay and ExpressPay 352 Benchmark Rating Strong 353 Analysis Authentication is important to prevent fraudulent transactions in the eCommerce environment Visa and Mastercard recognised the need to authenticate the cardholder during cardnotpresent eCommerce transactions and worked to develop a common payment authentication standard Authentication enhances security of online payment systems through identification of the payer It improves a trust between the merchant and the customer and b security in a world where cyber security has become a major issue 36 Ombudsman 361 Key Insight The Ombudsman Scheme for Digital Transactions launched on January 31 2019 was introduced with the objective to facilitate the redress of complaints regarding digital transactions undertaken by customers of a Payment System Participant viz any person other than a bank participating in a payment system banks are covered under the Banking Ombudsman Scheme A separate Ombudsman Scheme for complaints relating to digital financial transactions does not exist in other major jurisdictions Only in Australia the Ombudsman attends to complaints on secure payment system transactions such as PayPal or Safe2pay 362 Benchmark Rating Strong 363 Analysis The grievance redress mechanism of a system is a measure of its efficiency and effectiveness as it provides important feedback on the working of that system As stated in Reserve Bank of Indias Annual Report of 201718 the grievances relating to digital mode of financial transactions accounted for 19 per cent of total complaints during 201617 which has gone up to 28 per cent till end June 2018 particularly with the inclusion of deficiencies in mobile banking service as a ground of complaint under the scheme with effect from July 1 2017 Although a separate Ombudsman Scheme for complaints relating to digital financial transactions does not exist in other major jurisdictions the growing trend and increasing complexity of such complaints along with the emergence of nonbank service providers in the digital payment space underlines the need for designing a dedicated Ombudsman Scheme for redress of such grievances With this in view Reserve Bank of India announced constituting an Ombudsman Scheme for Digital Transactions covering services provided by entities falling under Reserve Banks regulatory jurisdiction S Securities Settlement and Clearing System 37 Central Counterparty CCP For the purpose of this study we look into the operations of the CCP regulated by the Reserve Bank viz Clearing Corporation of India Limited CCIL 371 Key Insight CCIL offers central counterparty CCP clearing services for trades in Indian Government Securities outright Repo Triparty Repo Forex including Forward trades and Rupee OTC derivative trades interest rate Swaps and Forward rate agreements India ranks strong with reference to the services offered and the risk management policies in place CCIL monitors its exposures on a real time basis and collects sufficient margins from member participants It also has constituted a default fund from member contributions Further it has a Settlement Reserve Fund and a Contingency Reserve Fund its skin in the game to cater to memberdefault and nondefault related losses 372 Benchmark Rating Strong 373 Analysis Central Counterparties typically handle large value transactions creating the possibility that a failure in such systems could cause broader financial and economic instability Market liquidity is critically dependent on confidence in the safety and reliability of the clearing and settlement arrangements Hence a financial or operational problem in such systems or any issue affecting one of its major participants could result in systemic risks In India CCIL manages its exposures to participants in the following ways Membership requirements Membership and access criteria are different for different segments Participation requirements are adequately tailored to ensure participation of all eligible entities and any restriction imposed is on account of the risk management guidelines or regulatory prescriptions Member exposure monitoring CCIL actively monitors its exposures arising out of CCP clearing on an online real time basis Settlement Risk CCIL eliminates settlement risk through a process of multilateral netting and deliveryversuspayment DVP or paymentversuspayment PVP modes of settlement while settling transactions in the cash market Margin collection Current and potential future exposures to each participant are covered through margins collected in the form of Government of India securities and cash from them Default Fund Default Funds are calibrated monthly and tested daily to ensure sufficiency to withstand the default of the largest Clearing Member and its affiliates along with 5 weak entities that give rise to the largest losses calculated under scenarios of extreme conditions Prefunded risk resources CCIL has Settlement Reserve Fund SRF and Contingency Reserve Fund CRF out of its own funds to take care of losses arising from participant default and losses other than participant default Recovery tools CCIL has provided for its insolvency in its Byelaws and has put in place recovery tools to cover liquidity shortfall beyond LOC and tools to handle various nondefault losses T Oversight 38 Oversight 381 Key Insight The Oversight by Central Bank is explicitly and implicitly laid down in the statute and the Reserve Bank of India is empowered with a wide variety of tools to carry out this function 382 Benchmark Rating Leader 383 Analysis The scope of central bank oversight pertaining to payment systems depends on national specificities and could include largevalue and retail payment systems payment instruments clearing and settlement systems for financial instruments and central counterparties Payment systems oversight involves monitoring of the reliability and efficiency of payment systems operating in the country on an ongoing basis assessing systems features and fostering changes when necessary The factors that contribute to the effectiveness of payment systems oversight are a the adequacy of legal powers of the central bank in the payment systems arena b the internal organization of the central bank in relation to payment systems activities and c the range of instruments that the central bank has as its disposal to oversee systems The Reserve Banks oversight of the payment systems has legal backing it has separate verticals to look after this task and has in its armoury tools like monitoring dialogue moral suasion issuing regulations imposing sanctions and onsite inspection to effectively carry out the oversight function U Cross Border Personal Remittances 39 Availability 391 Key Insight The Act governing cross border remittances is the Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999 FEMA The main channel for remittance is through authorised dealer category I banks which predominantly use the SWIFT messaging system Entities licenced as authorised dealer category II are permitted to make inward remittances only Outward remittances have to be channelized only through banks In the absence of alternatives the payment system is slow as compared to domestic payments 392 Benchmark rating Weak 393 Analysis Cross border remittances comprising crossborder payments notably traderelated payments and persontoperson international remittances are increasingly relevant for economies and their societies as a result of current global realities particularly growing economic integration and interdependence among countries at all levels and the increasing flow of immigrants throughout the world Remittances are a major source of foreign exchange earnings in many Low and Middle Income Countries LMICs like India From a policy making perspective retail crossborder payments share many of the features of domestic payments systems In India cross border remittances are mainly done through banks While nonbanks are permitted in the inward remittance domain it is a strict no in the outward remittances space Know Your Customer AntiMoney Laundering KYC AML and Combatting Financing of Terrorism CFT issues have made countries worldwide circumspect to flows leading to multiple checks and authentications These restrictions make crossborder remittances slow A good level of crossborder integration of payment systems should translate into crossborder payments being settled more efficiently and safely which could result in relatively lower costs and faster transactions A good example of this is entities like Paypal and authorised Money Transfer Service Scheme MTSS operators 40 Flows 401 Key Insight India is a leader with reference to inflows towards personal remittances It received USD 795 billion in 2018 This can be attributed to the large Indian Diaspora outside sending remittances to the country 402 Benchmark rating Leader 403 Analysis The upsurge is driven by stronger economic conditions in highincome economies particularly the United States and an increase in oil prices up to October 2018 which had a positive impact on remittance outflows from some Gulf countries such as the United Arab Emirates which reported 13 percent growth in outflows in the first half of 2018 With reference to nonpersonal remittances the path has been chequered for India Global cues increase outflows putting a pressure on the domestic currency In the period from 2012 flows have been adverse in 2013 owing to Taper Tantrum A stable capital account management however is in place to manage capital flows 41 Costs of Cross Border remittances 411 Key Insight Cost of sending remittances from India to Nepal was below 2 and from Singapore to India was in the range between 2 to 4 in the year 2018 The costs were high for remittances from Japan and South Africa and low for remittances from Russia 411 Benchmark rating Moderate 413 Analysis According to the Migration and Development Brief 30 2018 the global average cost of sending remittances has remained nearly stagnant at 69 percent in the third quarter of 2018 more than double the target Sustainable Development Goal or SDG of 3 percent by 2030 The report states that South Asia had the lowest average remittance costs of any world region at 54 percent in the third quarter of 2018 which was higher than 52 in the previous quarter The report states that remittances from India to Nepal and from Singapore to India are some of the less expensive Factors contributing to high costs include derisking measures taken by commercial banks for ensuring compliance with KYC AML guidelines and exclusive partnerships between national post office systems and a single money transfer operator Increased costs only increases remittances through nonbanking channels Harmonized regulation and adoption of innovative technologies could lower remittance costs by reducing intermediaries enabling standardized and verifiable transactions and smoothening AML CFT regulatory processes

2023,Payment and settlement systems play an important role in improving overall economic efficiency They consist of all the diverse arrangements that we use to systematically transfer moneycurrency paper instruments such as cheques and various electronic channels I am delighted to be here at the first Payment System Operators PSO Conference being organised by the Department of Payment Settlement Systems DPSS of the RBI It is indeed a matter of pride that the Indian payment systems have been globally recognised as bestinclass and future ready It is the combined effort of all the PSOs the Government and the Reserve Bank that has made India a shining star in global payments space The Reserve Bank acknowledges the efforts put in by each one of the stakeholders for accomplishing this Going by the theme of this conference Payments Rendezvous Reminisce Revitalise it is an opportune time to reminisce about this journey and identify the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead 2 Over the years and guided by key initiatives of the Reserve Bank the payments landscape in India has evolved into a stateoftheart system that is affordable accessible convenient fast safe and secure Indias payment infrastructure caters to the needs of a diverse group of consumers It comprises a wide array of payment options for executing large value payments retail credit transfers fast payments cheque clearing card payments bulk repetitive payments bill payments toll collections offline payments etc In India there are about 114 crore mobile phone connections1 with urban and rural share being 55 and 45 respectively Widespread use of mobile phones coupled with availability of internet services have provided thrust to digital payments This has led to anytime anywhere banking which transcends traditional branch banking hours About 1050 crore retail digital payment transactions2 worth 51 lakh crore processed in January 2023 stand as testimony to the size and efficiency of Indias digital payments 3 It is hard to believe today that there was a time when a card issued by a bank could be used only at ATMs of that bank Since then ATM networks have made interoperability the order of the day Similarly card networks have made it possible for us to pay for our purchases at any Point of Sale PoS terminal in India or abroad The Clearing Corporation of India Ltd CCIL and National Payments Corporation of India NPCI have set up worldclass payment infrastructure for securities and retail segment respectively These two institutions have emerged as the bedrock of our payments innovations in wholesale and retail payments A decade back it would have been hard to imagine a mobile phone becoming such a powerful and broadbased medium of doing payment transactions The launch of Unified Payments Interface UPI in 2016 has revolutionised the payments ecosystem with about 803 crore transactions3 worth 13 lakh crore processed in January 2023 alone For Indians banking facilities are available at their fingertips today We have moved far beyond doorstep banking Further given the importance of remittances received from Indian diaspora abroad Money Transfer Service Scheme MTSS operators form a significant section of PSOs Prepaid Payment Instrument PPI issuers have become a part of daily life for many Indians The facility provided by White Label ATM Operators WLAOs and Instant Money Transfer IMT operator have helped in expanding the avenues for cash withdrawal PSOs operating in niche segments like National Electronic Toll Collection NETC Bharat Bill Payment Operating Units BBPOUs and the newest entrants Payment Aggregators PAs are bringing ease of living to the segments they cater to Last but not the least Trade Receivables Discounting System TReDS platforms have enabled factoring of MSME receivables in a transparent and competitive manner thereby improving the liquidity position of MSMEs On an average 35000 Factoring Units FUs4 worth 7200 crore are discounted or financed in TReDS every month 4 The Reserve Bank has also taken a number of steps to increase safety and security of payment transactions as well as the ecosystem Introduction of Additional Factor of Authentication AFA for cardbased ecommerce and online transactions which was later extended to other payment modes and channels is a success story in Indian payment systems Simple measures like provision of switch on switch off facility for card transactions have positively impacted the trust of cardholders in digital payments In all these initiatives the Reserve Bank has kept customer convenience and safety as the prime objective Other examples could be contactless card transactions offline payments framework emandate based transactions CardonFile Tokenisation CoFT etc 5 During the pandemic resilience of payment systems was severely tested Movement of people running the operations of PSOs was restricted and some of them also fell ill In such a situation a spurt in digital payments was observed Suddenly many more people started transacting digitally PSOs rose to the occasion and showed remarkable tenacity All our payment systems have proved their worth during the pandemic Among other things I remember the efforts taken to tag the payment systems and the stakeholders as essential services This was a singlemost defining factor which enabled everyone to carry out various transactions unhindered 6 Let me also highlight a few more major steps taken by the Reserve Bank in payments sphere in recent years Since midDecember 2019 NEFT has been made available on 24x7 basis The same was replicated in RTGS a year later This development allowed interbank settlement of ancillary payment systems to happen in RTGS on 24x7x365 basis It also facilitated additional settlement cycles to be run by the payment system operators Presently around 90 multilateral net settlement batch files are posted in RTGS for effecting settlement of transactions during a particular day This has reduced the attendant liquidity credit and settlement risks 7 In the card payments space the Reserve Bank has issued instructions to restrict storage of card data only with card issuers and card networks ATM cash withdrawal transactions can now be completed without the need for cards Imagine how many cardrelated ATM frauds can now be mitigated 8 In the realm of UPI a number of steps have been taken recently RuPay credit cards have been permitted as underlying instrument in UPI UPI Lite has been introduced for offline payments UPI123Pay was introduced to allow feature phone users to perform UPI transactions In February 2023 UPI One World was launched to extend the UPI facility to inbound travellers from G20 countries Further inward payments have been permitted in Bharat Bill Payment System BBPS so that NRIs can seamlessly pay utility education and other bills on behalf of their family members and friends The scope reach and utility of BBPS has thus been significantly enlarged 9 The Reserve Bank has also permitted PPI issuers card networks and WLA operators to participate in Centralised Payment Systems ie RTGS and NEFT as direct members thereby enhancing accessibility of payments infrastructure and providing avenues for reducing intermediaries Even in TReDS many enhancements like insurance facility commencement of secondary market operations and modification in eligibility criteria to participate as financier have been announced These measures will empower the MSMEs to realise their dues faster and in a more costeffective manner Even in the Payment Aggregator PA space the Reserve Bank has taken significant efforts to bolster transparency and keep the space regulated and of course to be directly supervised as well 10 It is worth pointing out that the Reserve Bank has been transparent in terms of its data releases and in keeping the ecosystem informed of the actions taken The intent behind all these efforts is to move towards a lesscash society while maintaining the health of Indian payment systems The expectation is that PSOs would implement regulatory measures in an expeditious manner Let us work together and make the entire payments ecosystem a winwin for all 11 The fact that the Digital Payments Index DPI developed by the Reserve Bank has gone up from 100 as the base in March 2018 to 37746 as of September 2022 is testimony to the long way we have travelled However despite the progress made so far would it be wise to rest on our past laurels In my view the answer is No It is often said that change is the only constant in life There have been instances in the past when companies which dominated their market segment have failed to anticipate winds of change and did not innovate on products and processes Consequently they have become almost extinct Not just companies some of the countries which used to set the global agenda in previous centuries could not maintain their pole position and other countries have become the guiding light Therefore while we take pride in our achievements it is imperative to chart our way forward by identifying the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead 12 You are aware of the efforts being taken by the Reserve Bank to increase awareness and upscale digital payment adoption in the country The RBI Kehta Hai has become a popular phrase in the country The Digital Payments Awareness Week DPAW was celebrated recently I take great pride in participating in such programmes I am aware of the popularity of each one of you and your institutions in the digital payments space But as they say yeh dil maange more 13 I would now like to underscore some of the challenges that confront us and how we all can work together to resolve them The Reserve Bank has constantly been engaged with the task of bringing more people within the digital payments fold While making multitude of payment methods available we believe that for convincing more people to transact digitally it is imperative to augment their awareness and trust in digital payment methods Financial literacy is just the first step towards digital payments literacy Having opened more than 48 crore Jan Dhan accounts5 it would augur well to leverage these accounts and help people realise the ease that digital payments can bring to their lives PSOs have an important role to play here in creating awareness and countering misinformation 14 Availability and affordability of an expeditious grievance redress mechanism is of utmost importance to ensure public trust in digital payments While traditional bank branch model offers a physical place where customers can lodge their grievances the same may not be the case in digital payments where users sometimes find it difficult to ascertain the appropriate forum for lodging their grievances More the struggle undertaken by people in resolving their grievances more unlikely it becomes that they would attempt digital payments in future Prompt reconciliation of transactions by PSOs is an easy and expeditious method of addressing customer grievances Latest technologies may also be leveraged to support rulebased resolution of grievances with zero to minimal manual intervention While there is wide appreciation of the Online Dispute Resolution ODR system conceived by RBI how many PSOs have actually enabled it Should not the entities embrace such initiatives upfront and enhance customer satisfaction Afterall PSOs deal with public money 15 Increase in digital payments and its users also brings to the fore potential risks pertaining to cyber security data privacy and operational resilience PSOs must always be cognisant of the emerging threats and put in place suitable risk mitigation measures A related area that requires focus is outsourcing arrangements of PSOs with their vendors Service level agreements with vendors should meet minimum standards prescribed by the Reserve Bank In all such agreements PSOs right to conduct audit of the service provider must always be ensured 16 Since payment system operations are heavily dependent on technology many newage tech firms are entering the payments ecosystem Some of them have come under the regulatory ambit of the Reserve Bank for the first time At times some PSOs display unwillingness to comply with regulatory instructions citing various reasons like cost of carrying out systemlevel changes In this digital age there is a necessity to constantly upgrade the systems so as to remain relevant and increase efficiency Legacy systems must be updated to bring them in line with changing realities While any system may be presumed to be resilient and safe a single bad experience of the customer with digital payments may drive him away to other channels or modes of payments PSOs have a big responsibility here 17 For long term success the PSOs should specifically focus on i ensuring good governance and prudent risk management ii maintaining robust IT infrastructure with cyber resilience and iii putting in place responsive grievance redress mechanism Efforts may also be made for ensuring wider participation in the framework for offline payments PSOs may also work on formation of SelfRegulatory Organisations SROs for greater good of all stakeholders 18 Going forward the achievements of payment systems in India present more exciting opportunities for us Having successfully implemented so many payment systems domestically on such a large scale time has come to expand our reach overseas With the Indian economy getting increasingly integrated with the global system crossborder payments have assumed greater significance Our homegrown payment products UPI and RuPay network are enhancing their global footprint Launch of UPI linkage with Singapores PayNow is a major step forward In future such linkages with other countries will make crossborder payments simple affordable and realtime QR codebased merchant payments through UPI apps are already enabled in Bhutan Singapore and UAE All these would also help project Indias soft power at the global level Conclusion 19 To conclude I would like to say that a lot has been achieved but a lot more can and should be done in the days ahead Payments and settlements are serious businesses with potential downsides should anything go wrong Our effort should be to mitigate such downsides and capitalise on the upsides This is something all market participants must recognise and constantly remind themselves Every failed transaction every fraud attempted or actually carried out every complaint that is not satisfactorily addressed should be a cause of concern and must invite a detailed root cause analysis It would do well to remember that like the batsman on the cricket field you are only as good as the last ball faced 20 We must together make sure that no one in the country is left behind in the digital payments journey Under Reserve Banks Payments Vision 2025 we stand committed to the core theme of EPayments for Everyone Everywhere Everytime 4Es We must seize every opportunity to internationalise our payment products This will open up a new world of opportunities for our country This is the year of Indian Presidency of the G20 Let us present the India story to the global audience Let us work together let us innovate together This PSO Conference will provide ample opportunities to deliberate on all these issues With your active participation I am sure we will achieve more and stride forward with greater conviction and responsibility My best wishes to all the participants Thank you 1 Source Telecom subscription data as on 31st December 2022 httpswwwtraigovinsitesdefaultfilesPRNo13of20230pdf 23 Source RBI website Payment System Indicators 4 Source RBI

Mission Har Payment Digital Mumbai,Payment and settlement systems play an important role in improving overall economic efficiency They consist of all the diverse arrangements that we use to systematically transfer moneycurrency paper instruments such as cheques and various electronic channels 1 The Launching of Mission Har Payment Digital today during the Digital Payments Awareness Week DPAW 2023 reinforces RBIs commitment to deepen digital payments in the country 2 I am happy to note that the Department of Payment and Settlement Systems DPSS of the RBI is celebrating its 18th anniversary it was formed on March 7 2005 Congratulations to team DPSS on this milestone Over the years our payment systems have evolved and now we have multiple systems available round the clock facilitating instant payments Indias payment systems are talked about globally and several countries have shown interest to replicate Indias success story 3 It is a matter of pride that payment systems in India have witnessed over 1000 crore transactions every month since December 2022 This speaks volumes of the robustness of our payments ecosystem and acceptance by consumers A recent panIndia digital payments survey covering 90000 respondents revealed that 42 of respondents have used digital payments 4 Launched in 2016 UPI has emerged as the most popular and preferred payment mode in India pioneering Person to Person P2P as well as Person to Merchant P2M transactions in India accounting for 75 of the total digital payments The volume of UPI transactions has increased multifold from 045 crore in January 2017 to 804 crore in January 2023 The value of UPI transactions has increased from just 1700 crore to 1298 lakh crore during the same period The Digital Payments Awareness Week DPAW will further deepen the usage and footprint of digital payments across the country 5 The payments ecosystem has variety of payment systems that have facilitated migration to digital Unified Payments Interface UPI has facilitated digital payments to merchants such as retail outlets kirana stores street vendors etc across the country Bharat Bill Payment System BBPS has ensured migration of bill payments from cash cheques to digital mode with a hasslefree and streamlined digital bill payment experience The National Electronic Toll Collection NETC System has helped in migration of the toll payments to digital mode with enhancing efficiency in terms of reduced waiting time at toll plazas The National Automated Clearing House NACH system has also facilitated Government Direct Benefit Transfers DBT payments digitally and eliminating leakages in the system The smooth release of DBT benefits by the Prime Minister to 834 crore farmers under the PMKISAN Scheme is a testimony to the reliance and deliverability of our payment systems 6 We have taken steps for internationalisation of our payment systems and cross border linkage of fast payment systems of India and Singapore ie UPIPayNow This linkage is in addition to the QR code based and UPI enabled P2M payments already happening in Bhutan Singapore and UAE Recently we also enabled the visitors from G20 counties to be onboarded to UPI without having a bank account in India Through this initiative the G20 delegates had a firsthand experience of making merchant payments seamlessly through the UPI during their stay in India 7 The mission Har Payment Digital is aimed at reinforcing the ease and convenience of digital payments and facilitate onboarding of new consumers into the digital fold Various campaigns highlighting the digital payment channels available are being planned by the banks and nonbank payment system operators This will further encourage and support the adoption of digital payments in the country I am also happy to note that our Regional Offices will be taking up Jan Bhagidari activities to promote the acceptance and use of digital payments under the G20 theme of promoting digital public infrastructure during Indian presidency 8 The message of Digital Payment Apnao Auron ko bhi Sikhao Adopt digital payments and Also teach others under the mission Har Payment Digital is very relevant and expected to create greater awareness and usage among the people 9 Once consumers are onboarded to the digital payments ecosystem its advantages availability convenience speed and safety would ensure customer satisfaction and lead to furthering digital payments The message is in sync with the Payments Vision 2025 of the RBI ie EPayments for Everyone Everywhere Everytime Significantly inclusion has been identified as one of the anchors under the vision and various activities proposed now will help facilitate the same 10 We have also decided to initiate a 75 Digital Villages programme through adoption of 75 villages and involvement of village level entrepreneurs Under this programme and in observance of 75 years of independence PSOs will adopt 75 villages across the country and convert them into digital payment enabled villages They will conduct two camps in each of these villages to enhance awareness and onboard merchants in the village for digital payments 11 I appeal to all the stakeholders like industry payment system operators media digital payment users and others to teach nonusers about the merits of digital payments and fulfil the mission of Har Payment Digital with every person in the country becoming a digital payments user
https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1202&fn=9,Date Inauguration of the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub RBIH,Payment and settlement systems play an important role in improving overall economic efficiency They consist of all the diverse arrangements that we use to systematically transfer moneycurrency paper instruments such as cheques and various electronic channels Central Banks are often viewed as traditional institutions that set monetary policies issue currencies and regulate and supervise the financial sector segments and entities For every economy to grow steadily and efficiently this characteristic of a central bank is very important Being a full service central bank the RBI also plays a developmental role and is looked upon as a residual regulator as well 2 RBI has been able to perform its varied roles with required professionalism and pragmatism The ability to combine traditional functions with innovation has been critical to ensure orderly growth of the financial sector To achieve specific end goals apart from its own initiatives the RBI has been an institution builder and has nurtured the setting up and development of many institutions1 like NABARD CCIL NPCI IDRBT IGIDR and ReBIT 3 The recent phenomenon of technological innovations transforming the experience of availing financial services be it banking nonbanking payment services or being part of the financial markets has raised greater expectations from RBI to act as an innovation enabler as well To promote and facilitate an environment that accelerates innovation across the financial sector the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub RBIH has been set up as a wholly owned subsidiary of the RBI Taking into consideration the availability of skilled personnel innovation ecosystem linkages with academia incubation centres etc it was decided to set up the Hub at Bengaluru Karnataka 4 This initiative puts RBI in an exclusive group of select global central banks that are enterprising enough to change the mode of engagement while dealing with innovation It also reflects a genuine commitment to have continuous engagement with industry innovators academia and related stakeholders to nurture and leverage beneficial innovation in the financial sector which can deliver customised products particularly relevant for those at the bottom of the pyramid I have no doubt that this transformative move will facilitate further innovation not just in the areas under the remit of RBI but across the entire spectrum of financial sector in the country 5 The RBIH is an investment for the future The Hub is expected to build an ecosystem for development of prototypes patents and proofs of concept and promote crossthinking spanning regulatory domains and national boundaries With its own independent Board comprising eminent members from industry and academia I am sure RBIH is perfectly positioned to facilitate convergence of ideas among various stakeholders While fostering innovation however the underlying focus of RBIH should always be to promote access to financial services and products for the lowincome population in the country It should be our duty to promote such innovation that not only improves process efficiencies but also transforms the society The overall focus I feel should be on innovation with a purpose 6 I am happy to hear that to begin with the Hub has plans of identifying and mentoring startups having maximum potential I wish and hope that the Hub strives to nurture multiple indigenous ideas in the short to medium term each of which can positively impact one or more segments of our financial ecosystem The Hub is also expected to collaborate with various Government Ministries Departments Academia to identify problem statements in different domains and explore potential solutions To become a Hub in true sense RBIH should serve as a focal point for interaction among various stakeholders It should become the epicentre for promotion and exchange of views and knowledgesharing while also remaining focused on delivering clear cut objectives within reasonable timelines 7 RBIH should aim to establish itself as a respected innovation and incubation centre and showcase Indias commitment to openness of ideas resolve to innovate with underlying concern for inclusive growth I am confident that RBIH shall facilitate making our financial sector more agile participative and robust 8 With these words I am delighted to inaugurate the RBIH and wish it all success The expectations are high and the Hub will be guided by public interest It has the potential to touch the lives of every citizen by facilitating innovations with high social impact The Hub I am sure will emerge as a significant player in Indias journey of inclusive growth 1 National

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1058&fn=9,Date Excellence in Payments,Payment and settlement systems play an important role in improving overall economic efficiency They consist of all the diverse arrangements that we use to systematically transfer moneycurrency paper instruments such as cheques and various electronic channels Shri B Mahapatra Chairman NPCI Shri Dilip Asbe MD NPCI distinguished guests fellow bankers captains of the industry and the Honourable members of the Jury it gives me great pleasure to be amidst you all as NPCI today recognises the significant work done by the innovators in payment systems of the country Let me begin with a quote by Robin Sharma the motivational speaker who says Small daily improvements over time lead to stunning results No one can disagree with him This is most applicable to the area of payment systems in India which has got international recognition Giant strides taken by India in respect of payment and settlement systems and the retail payment space stand out prominently The role played by NPCI in this regard is immense and it is only befitting that the awards instituted by them reflect the importance ascribed towards innovations in payment systems Retail payment systems in India the Background 1 Thrust on digitisation of payment systems in India have had a relatively recent origin The NPCI envisioned as an umbrella organisation for retail payment systems in the country was setup with the guidance and support of the Reserve Bank and Indian Banks Association IBA in December 2008 2 The Payments Systems Vision Document 200508 of Reserve Bank had envisaged a new institutional structure for Retail Payment Systems preferably owned by banks and other financial institutions with the objective of a optimally using the resources through consolidation of existing infrastructure and building new infrastructure to enable national reach in a seamless manner and b creating a robust technology platform which provides service of the highest quality to customers at affordable price Accordingly in the year 2009 the NPCI started its role as a payment system provider by operating the ATM network when IDRBT handed over to it the National Financial Switch NFS Thereafter the RBI requisitioned the NPCI to operate the Cheque Truncation System CTS on its behalf 3 The objective of an umbrella organisation is to provide swift convenient anytimeanywhere payment services which are easytouse simple secure fast and costeffective for customers NPCI over the years has operated various retail payment systems viz IMPS UPIincluding BHIM National Unified USSD Platform NUUP for mobile payments RuPay NACH Aadhaar based AePS including Aadhaar Pay APBS BBPS NETC etc some of which are available for use on a 24x7 basis In all the payment systems the main role of NPCI has been to offer switching services and the attendant clearing and settlement facilities This has involved creating technology platforms setting up standards framing procedural guidelines creating risk management structure etc which in a way has changed the retail payments scenario of the country Thus initial expectations of the Reserve Bank have been largely fulfilled Retail Payment Systems The Rise of India in the Global Map 4 India has been always been a country which has fostered innovation and development in the area of payment and settlement systems The past decade has witnessed the blossoming of a myriad of payment systems all for the convenience of the common man 5 For a country which has a large dependence on cash the only major payment system until the 90s was the cheque clearing system We still process over 90 million cheques per month This is important as cheques are also noncash transactions and are often not given due importance This system was also unique in the sense that there were more than 1000 clearing houses in the country a big number by any standard The initial steps towards the change in the payment systems was the mechanisation of the clearing houses managed by the Reserve Bank in the late eighties by the introduction of the MICR technology for cheque processing This not only ushered in computerisation of clearing but also sowed the seeds for the digitisation of payments in the years to come The initial steps towards electronic products were all set up by the Reserve Bank and once the level of maturity was reached the market was allowed to develop and thus came about the emergence of interoperable ATMs The NFS has proven that in a large country like India networked ATMs can function very well and that costs are shared by competing entities as well Today the growth in ATM usage has migrated away from the metropolitan centres to the Tier 3 4 and 5 cities and the evolution of White label ATMs is proof of the large potential that ATMs have brought in 6 India is among a few countries which has settlement funds available for cheque clearing on a T1 basis with finality India has pride of place in the form of the UPI for retail payments We are also having the one of its kind Aadhar enabled payment systems as well the most ubiquitous QR codebased processing All these retail payment systems have resulted in the availability of a wide choice for the common man and more importantly at reasonable rates Excellence in Retail Payments 7 Retail payments have grown by nearly 45 per cent in volume and 30 per cent by value during 201718 Retail payment systems in India are characterised by large volumes and this makes it necessary that the systems are available whenever and wherever they are required If these systems are to deliver at the desired levels of expectations then there is a need to focus on certain key essential features of excellence Let me dwell a bit on each of these six excellence features 8 The first most important requirement in this regard is AVAILABILITY Retail payment systems by their very nature have to be available on demand at all times generally 24 by 7 and at all convenient locations and modes While most of our systems do reflect this the bottleneck is in terms of digital connectivity Addressing infrastructure constraint is critical to making available retail payment services to the population Currently a large number of RRBs rural cooperative banks and district central cooperative banks are yet to be part of retail platforms NEFT IMPS and NACH To encourage participation of citizens in semiurban and rural India there is a need to bring all RRBs rural cooperative banks and district central cooperative banks on various retail electronic platforms subject to their technological capability 9 The second requirement is EFFICIENCY In a country such as ours where the diaspora of population and the attendant requirements are of multiple levels it is essential that the systems are available at very cost effective rates and that they also perform as per the levels of expectations 10 The third crucial requirement is CONVENIENCE Todays customer is very discerning and choses convenience over cost a feature which is observed prominently among the young population The large scale use of Mobile Banking app based payment systems QR Code are all testimony to this fact 11 The fourth hallmark of excellence is SAFETY All payment systems should display explicit levels of safety It would be necessary that the systems not only meet the requirements of safety but are also subjected to safety audits at periodic intervals 12 The fifth essential necessity is SECURITY This is perhaps the central pivotal requirement since the entire world of today is grappling with issues relating to cyber security It is of utmost importance that the risk management practices to ensure smooth clearing and settlement settlement guarantee fund default fund line of credit margins debit caps etc are implemented with a conservativeness in approach and ruthlessness in implementation across each and every product There have been incidents involving misuse of the payment systems networks to defraud the participant institutions and or their customers Whether the fraudsters could have been prevented from doing so can be a matter of debate but there cannot be differing opinion that attention to security on an ongoing basis can greatly mitigate this risk Failure to do so by one few entities can put the entire payment system to peril While it is gratifying to note that NPCI in collaboration with IDRBT is providing optimal security to their retail payment systems there is an essential need for the entire eco system to have security as an integral component and ensure that security becomes a culture It is necessary to keep in mind that no system can be 100 fool proof While experimenting security standards that are best in class periodically testing them for vulnerability mitigating the risks it is equally important to build in resilience so that the service continues uninterrupted or recovers within a short period if there is any failure 13 The sixth indicator of excellence is ADAPTABILITY In a fast changing world product life cycles are becoming very short and thus adapting them for quick changes is a virtual requirement I may at this stage indicate that while the RBI introduced the MICR cheque clearing with the reader sorter based processing it also closed it a few years ago and brought in Cheque Truncation This is a good example of adaptability coupled with evolution Way Forward 14 Let me flag a few aspects which apply to any payment service provider and products and may need to be examined going forward i Performance Assessment As I look at the landscape of retail payment systems the question of whether we have too many productsvariants could be contemplated Products that have outlived its utility could be eased out The process of consolidation exit route for products and players should be actively pursued May be marketsusers themselves could take care of this It is also useful to make the systems interoperable to harness their true potential ii Customer Grievance Redressal Mechanism a The eBAAT programmes and the recent media workshops that RBI has conducted reveal one striking feature Lack of consumer awareness not just on the various payment options and features available but even on the grievance redressal mechanisms available This illiteracy transcends across all geographies and regions not just rural or semiurban north or south and is equally true of the staff at the front desks of bank branches Are we doing enough to educate the public Should it be the responsibility of the regulator alone The answer is no Let us all strive to build consumer awareness consciously and rigorously An informed customer is a crucial cog in the payment ecosystem b We get many complaints related to failure of transactions In our country when new users are being initiated into digital financial transactions if their early experience is less than wholesome they are put off and fall back on nondigital means It is imperative that we harness technology to ensure this Payment systems must ensure 100 accuracy c While we are on the subject of consumers let me also highlight the need for effective redressal mechanisms While an elaborate machinery is in place for redressing bankingrelated customer complaints the same cannot be said about redressal of complaints in the digital space and need to be put in place Member institutions and payment service providers must strengthen their grievance redressal mechanism to handle complaints which should be transparent easy and effective 15 The Reserve Bank has been placing its Vision for payment systems in the public domain right from 2001 Work on the next vision document for the ensuing period has now commenced The future will hold more challenges and the time would be ripe for consolidation as also growth RBI has always favoured competition and innovation in every field including payments systems Allowing nonbanks into the payment ecosystem was done to foster this with permission given to nonbanks to issue PPIs establish while label ATMs innovation and competition has gathered momentum This will guide the regulatory philosophy in the coming years also 16 In addition to issues highlighted above we have also been receiving inputs for the road map for payment systems over the next threefour years While we are working on the same there is a need to debate and put in place the following in the best possible manner They are Robust data collection big data analysis and analytics framework for creating benchmarks Platforms for industry wide sharing of fraud data Need for SelfRegulatory Organisations amongst various industry sectors Security standards for mobile payments including Internet of Things devices and security aspects of social networks based payments Leveraging block chain or distributed ledger technology Encouraging contact less payments including through QR code tokenisation Innovation through regulatory sandbox 17 Last but not the least the payment systems in India which as indicated earlier are amongst the best in the world This has happened only because of the collaborative efforts of all stake holders RBI on its part has always followed a consultative process with all the stakeholders while framing regulations While competition and innovation must be encouraged the regulator has to be mindful of stability of the system For example dilution of KYC AML framework can seriously undermine public confidence in the system itself and must be eschewed 18 The spirit to leverage technological innovation to safely and securely bridge the gap in payment systems should continue to be our watchword If todays awards of excellence is any indication I am optimistic that the future is bright Let us not be a part of the future let us create the future and make it successful 19 My congratulations to the winners of award today The award should goad them to further excellence and inspire others to create a payment system that is safe secure efficient convenient and best in the world I wish NPCI will play a stellar role in achieving this Thank you Keynote Address by Shri B P Kanungo Deputy Governor Reserve Bank of India at the NPCI National Payments Excellence Awards function Mumbai on May 29 2018 Inputs received from the

critical role to play in ensuring the safety and soundness of the banking systemand in maintaining financial stability and public confidence in this system I am delighted to participate in this symposium on Indian Economy organised by the Institute of Indian Economic Studies IIES Tokyo I understand this event is being organised by the IIES after a gap of 3 years due to the intervening period of the COVID19 pandemic Earlier this year in March 2023 Prof Sakakibara and Mr Sugaya had visited the Reserve Bank of India in Mumbai when we discussed about my participation in this symposium I would like to convey my sincere thanks and gratitude to Prof Sakakibara and the IIES for inviting me to participate in this event today 2 The global economy continues to face multiple macroeconomic and geopolitical shocks The prediction of a global recession has not come true but there are indications that global growth is slowing down amid tightening financial conditions and still elevated inflation Even as the fallouts of the pandemic the war in Ukraine and the unprecedented tightening of monetary policy reverberate across the world the recent developments in West Asia have added to the litany of challenges for the global economy Policymaking in this scenario becomes extremely challenging with difficult tradeoffs growth versus inflation price stability versus financial stability and current exigency versus future sustainability There is always a risk of doing too little or doing too much In such a scenario I would like to start with the Reserve Bank of Indias approach to policy making during this turbulent period Our Approach 3 To protect the economy from the relentless shocks in the recent period our endeavour has been to remain proactive pragmatic and prudent in our policy response We were conscious of the fact that an overdose of monetary medicine while relieving the pain in the short run could give rise to increased vulnerability and fragility over a period of time Following the onset of the COVID19 pandemic we injected liquidity but almost every measure of liquidity injection was for a limited period and was targeted By doing so we avoided the pitfall of a liquidity trap Further our lending standards were not diluted in terms of our counterparties banks and collateral requirements for onlending to stressed entities or sectors 4 On the regulatory side also our actions were measured We allowed lenders to offer moratorium on loan repayments and interest payments We put in place loan resolution frameworks for the COVID19 related stressed assets thereafter These loan resolution frameworks were not open ended but subject to achievement of certain financial and operational parameters The idea was to avoid the phenomenon of moral hazard and other pitfalls typically associated with open ended restructuring of loans 5 We are acutely aware that a healthy and efficient banking and financial system is the primary stabilising force against various shocks Mindful of this we have carried out a series of reforms in our regulatory and supervisory architecture We have come out with certain governance guidelines for banks and introduced a scalebased regulation for nonbank financial companies NBFCs based on the size and complexity of their businesses The process of supervision of banks NBFCs and other financial entities has also been substantially strengthened with the focus being on early detection and preemptive correction rather than reacting to the symptoms of weaknesses 6 Thanks to a confluence of factors including to a large extent the steps taken by the Reserve Bank the Indian economy has emerged as an epitome of stability and opportunity We have not only kept our house in order against large and overlapping global shocks but also improved our macroeconomic fundamentals and buffers While growth remains on track inflation is on a path of moderation though it is still above the target The balance sheets of banks and corporates are healthiest in a long time and with the public investment push by the Government they create favourable conditions for a sustained revival in investment Consumer confidence as evident from our surveys is on a rising trajectory since the pandemic lows Our external sector inspires confidence as we are reaping export opportunities in the services sector our current account deficit remains eminently manageable and we have bolstered our forex reserves to deal with potential eventualities 7 Today India has become the new engine of global growth with its young demography1 improving physical and digital infrastructure and above all an enabling policy environment In this context Japan and India continue to be the natural partners We share deep historical ties The teachings of Gautama Buddha have inspired our shared ethos and cultures We look up to the Japanese Economic Miracle as a learning opportunity as we prepare the ground to uplift Indias growth trajectory Japan has played a critical role in infrastructure building in India through several public and private sector partnerships2 There are many collaboration opportunities in frontier technologies such as space technology artificial intelligence quantum computing rareearths extraction semiconductors and resilient supply chains and other areas Our partnership could also be potentially strengthened in the sphere of human resources I am sure the future offers limitless possibilities to deepen our engagements for the benefit our people and the entire world 8 It would be worthwhile here to look a little deeper into Indias growth drivers its experience of managing inflation since the pandemic and the emerging opportunities and challenges especially in the FinTech space Growth Drivers 9 Policy focus on strengthening macroeconomic fundamentals and continued structural reforms have made India distinct in terms of growth outcomes This was reflected in the rebound in GDP growth after the pandemic from a contraction of 58 per cent in 202021 pandemic year to a growth of 91 per cent in 202122 and 72 per cent in 202223 The GDP grew by 78 per cent in the first quarter of 202324 and the available high frequency indicators suggest continuation of this momentum For the full year 202324 real GDP growth is projected at 65 per cent by the Reserve Bank 10 The innate resilience of the Indian economy could be attributed to its well diversified economic structure Although India has made rapid strides in external openness through trade and financial channels and gained competitiveness its core dependence for growth continues to be its domestic demand which also provides a cushion against external shocks Among the constituents of aggregate demand private consumption accounts for over half of GDP around 570 per cent average share during 201112 to 202223 followed by fixed investment and government consumption During the postpandemic recovery private consumption contributed an average of 660 per cent to GDP growth during 202122 and 2022233 At the same time structural reforms related to banking digitalisation taxation manufacturing etc have laid the foundation for a strong and sustainable growth over the medium and long term 11 On the supply side while the agricultural and the industrial sectors are maintaining their underlying momentum with renewed focus on manufacturing a major part of the Indias growth is coming from the services sector which again largely depends on domestic demand With crucial transformations underway Indias services sector is expected to lift its future trajectory of growth with a major impetus coming from rapid digitalisation of the economy which could be a gamechanger for economic development The external demand for Indias services is also increasingly gaining significance with services exports growing rapidly on the back of rising competitiveness in niche areas Indias services exports are diversifying from information technology IT related services to other professional services such as business development research and development professional management accountancy and legal services Domestic services are also undergoing a steady shift from lowskill consumeroriented services towards more technologyenabled business services The newly emerging startups are largely concentrated in the services sector Capitalising on Indias impressive public digital infrastructure4 many of these startups function as service providers for other businesses by offering services ranging from facilitating digitization and improving access to credit Managing Inflation 12 As in the case of growth there are some nuances in Indias experience in managing inflation visvis other countries The nature of inflation shocks throughout much of 2020 and 2021 in India were largely supply side shocks coming from COVID19 lockdowns and adverse weather events As lockdowns were withdrawn and the impact of weather disturbances waned forces of inflation correction began to operate The monetary and fiscal support provided during the pandemic were measured and targeted Consequently demandled inflation pressures in India were much less compared to several other economies The monetary policy committee MPC of the Reserve Bank was therefore able to look through the intermittent higher inflation prints with the aim of supporting economic growth during and in the aftermath of the COVID19 pandemic The MPC took the considered view that policy tightening in such a scenario would only accentuate the growth slowdown and impart higher volatility without being able to properly address the firstround effects of temporary supply side shocks This approach was in consonance with the flexibility embedded in our flexible inflation targeting framework wherein the primary objective of monetary policy is to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth 13 In early 2022 with the waning of COVID19 shocks on inflation gradual easing of supply bottlenecks and forecast of a normal monsoon inflation was expected to witness a significant moderation to the target rate of 4 per cent by Q3202223 These expectations were completely overturned by the war in Ukraine Initially the shocks came from the spike in global fuel and food prices which got further accentuated by local adverse weather events These shocks got transmitted to the retail prices of goods and services as domestic economic recovery and rising demand enabled passthrough of the large pentup input costs This also imparted stickiness to underlying core inflation The result was a generalized inflationary impulse 14 In the period that followed the Ukraine war in 2022 what stood out in India was the coordinated monetary and fiscal policy response to tame the inflationary pressures The MPC quickly changed gears by prioritising inflation over growth while changing its stance from being accommodative to withdrawal of accommodation in April 2022 The MPC then went on to increase the policy repo rate by 250 bps cumulatively between May 2022 and February 2023 to keep inflation expectations anchored break the core inflation persistence and contain second round effects 15 Looking back there were several aspects in our conduct of policy that helped in taking decisive and timely action during the heightened inflation pressures seen in 202223 First prudence was the cornerstone of the monetary policy response to the COVID19 shock with most of the extraordinary liquidity injection measures being targeted with preset end dates This ensured an orderly unwinding of the monetary stimulus as growth recovered Second the Government also adhered to fiscal prudence with actual fiscal deficit for 202223 kept in line with the Budget Estimates Third complementing the monetary policy measures were a series of proactive and targeted supply side measures by the Government5 All these factors put together proved to be critical in moderating the price pressures 16 As things stand today the MPC in its October 2023 meeting has projected CPI inflation at 54 per cent for 202324 a moderation from 67 per cent in 202223 Headline inflation however remains vulnerable to recurring and overlapping food price shocks The core inflation has also moderated by 170 basis points since its recent peak in January 2023 In these circumstances monetary policy remains watchful and actively disinflationary to progressively align inflation to the target while supporting growth FinTech Space 17 The advent of FinTechs has transformed the landscape of traditional financial services This has tremendously improved the delivery of financial services by making them faster cheaper efficient and more accessible India is currently the worlds third largest FinTech ecosystem in terms of the number of FinTechs operating in India It is growing at a robust pace and is projected to generate around US200 billion in revenue by the year 20306 contributing to approximately 13 per cent of the global FinTech industrys total revenue in 2030 The defining feature of the Indian model of digitisation is the lead taken by the Government and the Public Sector in building infrastructures on top of which innovative products are created by private sector FinTech firms and startups7 The JAM trinity a combination of bank accounts Jan Dhan Aadhaar Indias biometric identity system that provides a single and portable proof of identity and Mobile phone numbers has revolutionised Indias FinTech ecosystem in terms of financial inclusion digitisation of financial services and overall service delivery 18 On top of this the Unified Payments Interface UPI has played a phenomenal role in the FinTech revolution in India Its success story has in fact become an international model Its ability to instantly transfer money between bank accounts through mobile applications has transformed the way people make digital transactions The interoperability of UPI across banks and payments systems has created a unified payment ecosystem It has facilitated digital payments even for small businesses and street vendors leading to greater financial inclusion UPI has also spurred development of new payment related products and services8 Further linking of the UPI with fast payment systems of other countries is also being undertaken Linkage of fast payment systems of India and Japan may also be explored to leverage the power of fintech and make crossborder payments more efficient and less costly9 19 The Reserve Bank has also commenced pilot runs of Indias central bank digital currency CBDC the eRupee for specific use cases in both wholesale and retail segments Our approach to FinTech ecosystem is customercentric focus on good governance ensuring effective oversight ethical conduct and risk management and encouraging selfregulation by the FinTechs themselves through a SelfRegulatory Organization SRO 20 Although financial innovation enhances ease of payment and lowers its cost they also pose risks and challenges to the financial system These risks have a bearing on overall financial stability and market integrity We therefore intend to play a dual role of acting as promoter of innovation as well as being the regulator While promoting innovation our focus is on ensuring a wellregulated ecosystem that addresses systemic risks and challenges Concluding Observations 21 It is a matter of satisfaction that the Indian economy has sailed through the turbulent waters smoothly during the recent years Driven by its inherent dynamism and supported by a prudent policy mix growth is getting stronger foothold while inflation is also coming under control Our economic performance also owes a lot to the very calibrated focused and targeted monetary and fiscal responses since the pandemic 22 I must add that in the current uncertain environment it is best to avoid any sense of complacency We remain agile and continue to fortify our macroeconomic fundamentals and buffers Today the confidence and trust in Indias prospects are at an alltime high To seize the moment India looks at Japan as a close partner to usher in a new era of growth and prosperity for both our countries We will be celebrating the festival of lights Deepavali in a few days in India With Japan as our close partner I am sure the land of the rising sun will further light up our spirits to take our economies and wellbeing of our people to greater heights Thank you Namaskar 1 India is endowed with a great demographic dividend as 68 per cent of the total population estimated at 1429 billion in the latest World Population Report 2023 United Nations Population Fund belongs to 1564 years 2

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1391&fn=2,Date Reflections Challenges in Regulations,Banks are fundamental to the nations financial system The central bank has a critical role to play in ensuring the safety and soundness of the banking systemand in maintaining financial stability and public confidence in this system Ladies gentlemen and distinguished guests It is indeed a pleasure to be participating in this summit a gathering that is engaged to distill the essence of responsible stewardship in the corporate world Keeping up with the theme of this session The Challenge of Regulation I will reflect a bit on the dynamic landscape of regulations and regulation making its evolving nature and on the transformation underway in the financial sector Later I will also outline a few challenges and dilemmas encountered by the regulators in framing appropriate regulations to manage these transitions Do we need Regulations Many believe that minimal regulations is the best way to foster growth of the enterprise But history is replete with the examples of how minimal regulation coupled with lenient supervision and restrained enforcements have often led to financial crises In fact we would all agree that nothing could be more damaging to sustainable growth than a misfiring banking and financial sector While in an ideal scenario the invisible hand would ensure that the system functions flawlessly for the greater good with minimal regulatory oversight in reality it does not happen that way As such to control the irrational exuberance in the financial sector there is need for a regulator who sets the boundaries and also enforces them for ensuring a sound and robust set of financial institutions and there by promotes financial stability Regulations usually impose restrictions on the entry and operations of the entity while controlling the what and how of the business that is undertaken This process imposes opportunity cost on regulated entities to achieve the desired objectives However these are distributable costs to deliver a collective good Therefore regulations ensure that the overall financial system fulfils its supportive role to the real sector through efficient financial intermediation and its remains stable robust and responsive Moreover financial sector and banking industry is special The inherent ability of banks to generate leverage and the potential to trigger a domino effect in the financial system makes it unique Further banks are not just the custodians of the customers hardearned savings but also custodians of public trust It is RBIs responsibility to ensure that the trust reposed by the customers and depositors on banks is resolutely upheld Managing Transitions As we look at the challenges in the financial sector today it becomes important to address the profound structural shifts that are transforming the shape of the financial sector These transitions encompass a myriad of factors each with its own set of unique challenges These are also complex multifaceted issues that demand nuanced adaptable solutions Striking the right balance between encouraging innovation and maintaining the stability and security of the financial sector is always a formidable task Let me elaborate on few of such transitions which we are engaged with Climate Transition We are all aware of the global challenge that climate change poses to our planet and its impact which is felt across the world The transition to a more sustainable environmentally responsible financial sector is no longer an option but an imperative As societies demand greater commitment towards a cleaner greener environment regulators must undertake the task of integrating climate risks into the regulatory frameworks Ensuring that financial institutions consider the environmental impact of their actions while simultaneously managing the flow of credit demands a delicate balancing act and requires collaborative solutions The moot question which the regulators have to deliberate on is whether climate risk is a unique risk that need to be captured separately and thus requires a separate framework on a standalone basis or whether it transverses across credit market and operational risks and can be captured as a part of the existing risk frameworks Another point of debate is whether these risks need to be captured as combination of pillar 2 supervisory review and pillar 3 market discipline and disclosures requirements or is it better to capture the risk as part of pillar 1 capital and liquidity straight way Technology Transition Technology is reshaping the landscape of finance at an unprecedented pace and has emerged as a transformative force reshaping operations and customer experiences alike Digitalisation is helping to enlarge the options available to customers and lenders increase efficiency and competition in the provision of financial services and more importantly making these services available to larger segments of the population As we embrace these technological advancements it is imperative that regulatory frameworks evolve in tandem to ensure the security privacy and integrity of financial system In an era defined by data the protection of personal and financial information has come the fore In India the Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 DPDP Act has been recently enacted Such a legislation was necessary for safeguarding individuals rights and ensuring responsible handling of personal data Banks and other financial institutions as custodians of vast volumes of sensitive customer data must make the required efforts to adhere to the provisions of the Act and related regulations To manage this transition smoothly financial institutions must invest in robust data governance frameworks ensuring that they and their data processors collect process and store data in complete adherence to the law and the regulations Managing the transition to a more dataconscious and data cultured institution necessitates treading a delicate path The Digital Intermediation Transition Post the pandemic digital lending and emergence of digital platforms providing loans has seen an exponential rise in various emerging economies including India While this led to an increase in scale and velocity of credit in an increasingly digital environment it has raised a host of business conduct issues The questions for any regulator to consider are whether they should try to be ahead of the curve to ensure that financial innovations are enabled only after putting in place an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework or to follow a relaxed approach of allowing the markets to develop on its own By being more accommodating do the regulators then run the risk of having to deal with unanticipated business conduct concerns and in extreme cases confront and deal with potential events that could trigger systemic risks which may lead to outcomes that are difficult to anticipate and manage Nonetheless for a regulator inaction can never be an option The pace with which newer business models players and products are coming up with such entities often exploiting the gaps in existing regulations or conducting business operations that fall in a regulatory grey area continues to be a challenge The business models that are built to challenge the regulatory perimeters aggressive marketing strategies and those that are engaged in exploitation of gullible customers makes it clear that such issues need intervention But the dilemma lies in deciding the extent of regulatory intervention which will contain and restrict the customer abuse without significantly altering the nature of FinTech led innovation For example in the beginning of 2020 the lending activities of the new technology driven platforms involved small ticket size loans granted to a large number of borrowers mostly falling in the lower income strata of the society such as students retail businesses gig workers etc For these borrowers taking a loan at an exorbitant interest rate meant falling into a vicious debt trap What made the situation worse was the fact that borrowers were not even aware of such high interest rate or charges before taking the loan as these were not disclosed upfront there was no interface except the mobile app to raise their grievances and the recovery practices were harsh and unorthodox We had also observed that right from credit underwriting to recovery every activity was being outsourced with scant regard to customer privacy and protection Digital Lending was operating on a rent an RE model where the FinTech platform was undertaking all the lending activities on behalf of the regulated entity by posing itself as principal In many cases the customers were not even aware of the name of the bank or NBFC which had sanctioned the loan To tackle this issue the regulatory stance has converged on regulating the digital lending activity and the arrangements between regulated entities and FinTechs providing specified services to REs which were rechristened as Lending Service Proivers or LSPs RBIs digital lending regulations have laid down a broad regulatory framework under which FinTechs can become enabling partners with regulated entities These guidelines are a mix of reiteration of the extant guidelines like reporting to CICs conducting due diligence before engaging LSPs etc and some fresh ones with REs being the fulcrum around which digital lending activities are required to operate with the regulatory compliance being made their responsibility The Social Media Transition Social media has revolutionized the speed and scope of dissemination of information Information sharing has never been so quick and unhindered thus far But this also means that unsubstantiated rumors and false news can also spread equally quickly and can adversely affect financial institutions especially banks The recent banking turmoil in USA has jolted some of the widely held views regarding principles of liquidity management and nature and speed of bank runs The banking turmoil in the United States and Europe in early March 2023 has had a significant impact on the global financial system This episode has highlighted the need for a reassessment of global standards in financial sector regulations This episode has offered two important lessons First the trust is vulnerable to perceptions of weaknesses and misinformed social media commentary Second that in an age of social media and internet banking the speed with which bank runs occur is unprecedented and therefore the response time to handle any such crisis has telescoped to a fraction of what was hitherto considered acceptable To address these challenges constant and effective supervision complemented by ability of the bank concerned to monitor and prevent spread of misinformation over social media has become vital How is RBI Managing these Transitions RBIs approach has always been to foster and support innovations and dynamism while balancing it with financial stability considerations Therefore let me elaborate what are we doing to manage these transitions Simplifying Regulations The regulatory instructions have evolved over a period of time in consonance with the developmental trajectory of the financial system and institutions The regulatory perimeter has also expanded as the Indian financial system has ventured into newer business models product lines and geographical territories Over time this may have led to certain regulations becoming complex with concomitant increase in compliance burden Therefore a periodic stocktake is useful to review the regulatory instructions and compliance procedures with a view to streamlining rationalising them and making them more effective The RBI had setup Regulations Review Authority 20 RRA in 2021 following the RRA 1 set up in 1999 to undertake this task and ensuring simplicity of regulations that has become a priority for us In my view future regulations must be responsive to the evolving need of the financial system For this to happen we have adopted a fivepillar strategy First we are making sure that future regulations are forward looking and proactive Second we have become nimble in our approach This is critical as the pace of change has accelerated Third our approach to regulation making has become more data driven and impact assessment oriented This in turns has led to a more analytical decision making process and is helping in making provision for a suitable path for transition wherever warranted Fourth we have been adopting a more consultative approach to regulation making Prior consultation with stakeholders enables us to gather diverse viewpoints and incorporate them in the regulations This also makes implementation of regulations better The fifth and last pillar is collaboration We are engaging more and more with stakeholders government and with other regulators and industry to evolve a safe and resilient financial sector The Reserve Bank has been conferred upon the powers to make subordinate legislation under a wide spectrum of statutes This casts a responsibility upon RBI to ensure that its instructions are within the perimeters set by the statutory mandate clear in language appropriate and proportional Therefore we have increased our focus on providing suitable training and skills to our officers so that the regulations can be written in simple language and there is better clarity on the regulatory intent Bringing customer conduct into focus In whole scheme of things the customer should and must remain the centre The two primary objectives of regulation viz ensuring financial stability and protecting customer interest leads to two broad categories of regulations prudential regulations and conduct regulations Prudential regulation builds foundation for financial stability while conduct regulation lays the ethical foundation for maintaining customer trust together help in safeguarding the integrity of our financial system Accordingly our endeavour has been to inculcate responsible conduct on the part of the regulated entities We have asked banks to design suitability and performance requirements for financial products and financial services keeping in mind the interests of its customers This includes Board level oversight arrangements that a bank must put in place in order to meet these objectives As we further strengthen our approach towards addressing the concerns in the area of conduct based regulations the guiding philosophy would be to set certain minimum regulatory expectations with the option for entities to adopt higher standards depending upon their size proportionality and customer focus The ultimate message is that the regulated entities should treat all customers big or small urban or rural educated or less educated in a transparent and ethical manner Principle Based vs Rule Based Regulations There is an ongoing debate of whether a principle based approach is preferable or whether a rulebased approach to regulations is the better option At different points in time one approach has influenced the policymakers more than the other The benefit of rulesbased regulations is that it provides certainty and firm guidance on what regulated entities are required to do and from the regulators point of view the measurable and explainable regulatory targets and responsibilities that can be easily monitored and enforced But in a prescriptive approach to regulation the rules might end up becoming more important than the intended outcome for which they were designed leading to a culture of box ticking compliance In contrast principlebased regulation is more like a compass providing regulated entities with a general direction without specifying the precise route to be taken The principles are crafted to be suitable for a wide array of situations and emphasize on desired outcomes They grant regulated entities the flexibility to adapt to evolving circumstances and to innovate however it also requires them to exercise prudent judgment and make responsible decisions But often to make the regulatory expectations clear principlebased regulations are required to be supplemented with clarifications illustrations and guidance notes So where do we stand in the continuum of rulebased and principlebased regulatory approach The Reserve Bank as a matter of policy has been gradually giving banks greater operational freedom to conduct their business operations within the overarching regulatory framework We are thus moving at a good pace towards making our regulations increasingly principlebased Maintaining a Level Playing Field A level playing field ensures that all participants operate within a fair and consistent regulatory framework where the potential risks and rewards of the financial system are evenly balanced There is widespread agreement that a level playing field is a key condition for a competitive financial sector As a regulator we are following the principle of same activity same risk same regulation This approach can be seen in the case of our guidelines on Digital lending first loss default guarantee FLDG and microfinance sector However maintaining a level playing field has to be counter balanced by ensuring regulations that are proportionate to the risks posed by the firm to the financial system We are quite mindful of the need to ensure that the regulatory burden on an entity should be proportionate to the risks posed by it to the financial system and to the size of its operation This thought has underscored our revised scalebased regulatory approach to NBFCs and revised regulatory framework for UCBs It however must also be appreciated that limiting the potential for regulatory arbitrage and establishing a level playing field for market participants is an important objective for regulators but it is not the overriding one To ensure efficient market functioning and more broadly to safeguard the public interest policymakers may at times need to treat different players differently Conclusion Let me conclude Framing regulations in todays dynamic and interconnected world is a challenging task but it is a challenge that we are fully committed to overcoming As a regulator our most important contribution to the society is that we do our job by making forward looking riskbased and proportionate regulations and implement them in a consistent manner At the same time we are conscious that process of regulation making must yield a net surplus for the financial system Even as we move forward on these lines we need to remain steadfast in our dedication to maintaining stability fostering growth and safeguarding the interests of customers 1 The inputs provided by Deepak Rana Vishal Kumar Prasad Pramanshu Rajput and Pradeep Kumar are sincerely

organised by the Ministry of Finance Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India August 11 2023 Mumbai,Banks are fundamental to the nations financial system The central bank has a critical role to play in ensuring the safety and soundness of the banking systemand in maintaining financial stability and public confidence in this system Todays seminar on Global Economy Challenges Opportunities and the Way Forward held as part of the International Financial Architecture IFA and Framework Working Groups FWG workstreams under Indias G20 Presidency including the three panel discussions have yielded rich and insightful thoughts on i financing development and global public goods ii tackling global debt vulnerabilities and iii the key risks to the global economy All these issues are priorities under Indias G20 Presidency I take this opportunity to thank all the participants for enhancing the quality of discussions during the day 2 Today Policy makers across the world are grappling with multifarious and intertwined challenges in ensuring postpandemic recovery in the face of elevated inflation financial market vulnerabilities reduced policy headroom and geopolitical tensions In this milieu Indias G20 Presidency aims at enhancing global cooperation to face such common challenges This is embodied in the Presidency theme of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam One EarthOne FamilyOne Future This theme underlines the importance of global public goods for common prosperity of all 3 Global Public Goods GPGs play a crucial role in shaping developmental strategies and securing human welfare across borders and generations Financing them has become a critical issue in the wake of the COVID19 pandemic the highly unsettled geopolitical environment climate change fractures in international supply chains and tectonic shifts in financial market conditions and global liquidity Given the confluence of such factors global financial stability is gaining prominence in the hierarchy of global public goods 4 Indias experience has shown how Digital Public Infrastructure DPI can be utilised for advancing financial inclusion and productivity gains through cost reductions Our sustained engagement in the India Stack and the Unified Payments Interface UPI especially during the pandemic and thereafter has filled us with the conviction that digital public infrastructure like the UPI can become a critical part of global public goods when scaled up beyond national borders 5 While the UPI has been a public sector led initiative it is not necessary that public goods can only be developed and financed by the public sector The private sector needs to engage in the provision of GPGs not just because they create an enabling ecosystem for businesses to thrive but also because they would be a commercially viable endeavour In this regard it is worthwhile to build innovative design features which private investors find attractive in financing of GPGs In the investment cascade keeping in view the very large investment requirements the trigger financing can come from public investment This would help in minimizing risk and expanding market access Subsequent financing needs can be met by the private sector This is where international capital flows and movements assume importance Hence risk sharing should be an important design element in fostering private financing for global public goods In this endeavour Multilateral Development Banks MDBs could catalyse private sector investment through risk sharing mechanisms 6 Recent fault lines in global cooperation have led to underprovisioning of global public goods and erosion of economic welfare Absence of seamless access to COVID19 vaccines is a case in point Similarly the lack of timely financial support and creditor cooperation can explain even if partly the rising debt stress in some developing economies High and unsustainable debt levels have severely constrained many countries limiting their fiscal capacity While the G20led initiatives such as the Common Framework CF for debt treatment and the Debt Service Suspension Initiative DSSI have been discussed intensely significant progress beyond these have to be achieved I would like to make three specific suggestions in this context 7 First it is essential that Debt Sustainability Analysis DSA for countries is realistic on growth and fiscal projections are fully founded on accurate and comprehensive debt data A global debt datasharing platform can help in this regard Establishing such a platform could be very challenging and may take several years In the interregnum therefore we may examine the possibility of constructing suitable proxies for debt flows Such proxies may be derived from data on capital flows and locational banking statistics from sources such as the Institute of International Finance IIF and the Bank for International Settlements BIS 8 Second a multilateral debt relief program providing targeted assistance to lowincome countries with high debt levels needs to be considered on a priority basis This initiative can be designed with a clear focus on utilisation of debt relief for sustainable development projects and poverty reduction efforts To this end instruments such as debtfordevelopment swaps1 and green debt relief programs2 could be employed 9 Third the crucial role of the International Monetary Fund IMF and the World Bank in addressing global debt vulnerabilities cannot be overstated These institutions are at the centre of international monetary and financial system Hence it is incumbent upon them to do more for countries in debt distress At present the IMFs precautionary programmes such as the Precautionary Lending Line are available for countries with sound macrofundamentals however there is little reason for countries with strong macrofundamentals to seek Precautionary Lines Further StandBy Arrangements SBAs are offered for countries with a balance of payments crisis but SBAs come with performance benchmarks and the attendant stigma This is an important issue as the recent experience shows how the perceived stigma of andor lack of access to IMF programmes can cause countries to seek support from other lenders rather than the IMF with debt sustainability consequences It may be helpful if programs can be designed with less conditionality for countries with macrofundamentals that are not sound but reasonably resilient if they are not marred by balance of payments stress 10 The key point I am trying to stress is that corrective measures including financing should be put in place in a timely nonstigmatised and more open access basis For this purpose a bigger and stronger IMF that is capable of managing the levels of country risk assumes crucial importance Since the IMFs support is linked to the quota size of countries the 16th general review of quotas and its attendant requirements including governance reform need to be completed expeditiously Besides enhancing the legitimacy of the IMF in its oversight of the international monetary and financial system this will increase traction for the IMFs policy advice We must not allow the burden of debt to stifle the potential for global growth 11 In this connection the panel discussion on key risks to global growth namely inflation financial stability and climate change assumes topical relevance Even as the global economic outlook is marred by risks to the downside longterm structural challenges such as climate change must be addressed through supply of adequate and affordable financing for green transition 12 We must however be mindful of the potential financial stability implications of green transition The transition efforts must address both the physical and transition risks of climate change Smooth and orderly green transition is necessary to avoid disruptions to economic activity and loss of growth potential While the investment needs for smooth green transition are large the actual financial flows to green projects are highly skewed and are by and large concentrated in Advanced Economies There is an urgent need to enhance green capital flows to EMDEs As noted by the IMF in the recent Global Financial Stability Report the green flows to EMDEs are curtailed by inadequate supply of green rated investment projects While green flows today are dependent on ESG ratings recent research shows that these ESG ratings do not adequately reflect financial and nonfinancial materialities of these investments Therefore there is a need to ensure that green ratings reflect the actual environmental impact of the projects so as to avoid greenwashing 13 A crucial aspect of this effort is ensuring private financing for climate transition efforts through globally comparable and transparent disclosure norms and taxonomy of green activities The International Sustainability Standards Board ISSB is actively working on these aspects 14 While efforts are underway to improve and deepen green financing it is equally critical to fortify regulatory frameworks that enable the implementation of climate taxonomy across jurisdictions prevent greenwashing and facilitate sufficient green capital inflows to EMDEs A comprehensive and collaborative approach involving governments private sector entities financial institutions civil society organizations and the general public is essential for ensuing a successful transition to a sustainable future 15 Let me now conclude by saying that structural challenges such as financing global public goods managing global debt vulnerabilities and dealing with climate transition are uphill tasks which no country can achieve alone Recommitting to multilateralism is the need of the hour and this is precisely what the Indian Presidency of G20 is trying to foster It is also important to take note of peoplecentric transformative changes taking place in member countries like the UPI and the financial inclusion initiatives in India Wider adoption of such models would make the world a better place for everyone Thank you 1 To support countries transitioning to lowcarbon and climateresilient economies through debt swaps that link debt relief to the implementation of environmentally friendly policies and projects 2 Creditors offer debt reductions or writeoffs in exchange for investments in projects that promote environmental sustainability social development and economic growth
https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1376&fn=2,Date Remarks of Shri M Rajeshwar Rao Deputy Governor Panel Discussion on Climate Implications for Central Banking,Banks are fundamental to the nations financial system The central bank has a critical role to play in ensuring the safety and soundness of the banking systemand in maintaining financial stability and public confidence in this system 1 Good Afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen 2 Thank you for inviting me to participate in this dialogue and the Panel Discussion on Climate Implications for Central Banking Climate change and its impact on us is no longer a distant threat Rising global temperatures extreme weather events changing weather patterns and the degradation of ecosystems are threatening our lives and livelihoods We therefore have to face up to the challenge of climate change sooner not later Now it is up to us to deal with this in a calibrated and wellplanned manner or deal with it once we are pushed into a corner with little elbow room Therefore the timing of this dialogue is quite appropriate and provides an opportunity to discuss and deliberate on this issue 3 Climate change poses a threat to our longterm growth and prosperity It has potential to create shocks to monetary stability growth financial stability the safety and soundness of regulated entities Therefore keeping in view the theme of todays discussion in my remarks I intend to focus on the role of central banks in managing the outcomes from climate change 4 A range of factors would influence how things pan out in future including changes in climaterelated policies and regulations emergence of newer technologies and behavioural changes in consumers To ensure a successful transition to a sustainable future we need a multifaceted approach that involves governments private sector entities financial institutions civil society organizations and the public 5 Central banks typically are concerned with the questions of monetary policy and growth of financial stability and regulation and supervision of financial system In many countries including India the Central Banks are statutorily mandated to pursue a given set of objectives This means that they should address risks and threats that impact their core mission Climate change does pose such a risk They must therefore manage outcomes which could affect the stability of the financial system and safety and soundness of the financial entities 6 From a bankers perspective Climate risks can impact the macroeconomic outcomes primarily from two channels ie physical risks and transition risks While physical risks refer to direct outcomes of climatic events such as wildfires storms and floods the transition risks refer to the risks arising from the process of adjustment towards reducing the emission intensity of the economy For example extreme weather events such as storms or floods can disrupt production and supply chains and create shortages of essential goods and services This could lead to a sudden increase in prices leading to inflationary pressures Again in India rising temperatures heat waves and changing rainfall patterns can also affect crop yields resulting in higher or at times lower prices of some of the agriculture produce This may lead to uncertainty in their prices for both producers and consumers Such uncertainties can make measurement and management of inflation and anchoring of inflation expectations difficult 7 Another challenge that may arise on account of physical risk dimension of climate change is increased probability of loss to banks and financial institutions First the operations of these financial institutions if concentrated in a vulnerable geographical location may be vulnerable to losses on account of climate events Second the assets which they have financed or taken as collateral may become unavailable or lose value due to adverse climate events Such loans may turn nonperforming impacting banks capacity to lend further 8 The transition risks if not managed properly could also lead to sudden fall in asset prices of the carbonintensive assets or increase in the risk premia or both making them unattractive to hold and perhaps creating larger ripples across the financial markets On the other side the prices of green assets may rise disproportionately creating a bubblelike situation Further increased demand of such assets may give rise to greenwashing concerns Disorderly transition could create piquant situations where a sector or industry may witness credit withdrawal or restrictive cost without buildup of sufficient and viable alternatives Such situations may become a limiting factor for production of essential commodities or increase the cost of production 9 Central banks are therefore beginning to recognise and evaluate risks which climate change may pose to monetary policy financial stability and regulated entities More Importantly the risks arising from climate change transverse geographical boundaries and sectoral segmentations Therefore tackling climate change requires global coordination and cooperation Being mindful of these challenges international organisations such as the IMF and standardsetting bodies such as the BCBS and FSB are stepping up their work on issues relating to climate change 10 At the global level several initiatives are already underway under the aegis of the G20 Different standard setting bodies are undertaking focused work to address the vulnerabilities arising from climate change The Financial Stability Board FSB had published a Roadmap for Addressing Financial Risks from Climate Change which was endorsed by the G20 in July 2021 and has since been updated The Roadmap sets out a comprehensive and coordinated plan for addressing climaterelated financial risks and covers four areas ie firmlevel disclosures data vulnerabilities and regulatory and supervisory practices tools 11 The consequences intensity severity and frequency of climate events are hard to measure and difficult to predict The impact of these events on banks and financial institutions is even more difficult to quantify Therefore the first step in managing the risks to which banks and other regulated entities are exposed from climate events is to measure the amount of exposure at risk This is only possible if the firms adequately and transparently disclose the carbon intensity of their operations The data related to exposure of firms banks and financial institution to climate events is crucial for planning the transition International Sustainability Standards Board ISSB has been working on designing global sustainabilityrelated disclosures The standards will help improve trust and confidence in sustainability disclosures in companies and also create a common language for disclosure about the effect arising from climaterelated risks and opportunities on their prospects 12 The next step in this process is ensuring availability of data and identification of vulnerabilities For this we need time consistent transparent standardised and forwardlooking disclosures for identification of vulnerabilities At a firmlevel the scenario analysis and stress testing would help frame the strategies to manage the risks for individual entities Central banks across the globe are encouraging banks and other lenders to identify such vulnerabilities In India we plan on issuing guidance to banks on the stress testing for climate vulnerability of their credit portfolio soon 13 Further by the virtue of their mandate for regulating and supervising the financial sector central banks are uniquely placed to influence the behaviour of institutions within the financial system incentivize climatefriendly investments and support the mobilization of capital for sustainable development Most often central banks have used positive reinforcement and incentive structure to encourage green finance Financial markets are also increasingly beginning to integrate climate risks and opportunities into investment decision making The number of ESGfocused funds is increasing globally Institutional investors are expecting their investee companies to make detailed climaterelated financial disclosures pursue netzero goals declare transition plans and report progress Green bonds climate funds and blended finance mechanisms can attract private investment towards climate projects However these developments do also give rise to greenwashing concerns which may require regulatory interventions in future to ensure that what is being projected as green is in fact actually green 14 At the cost of repetition let me emphasize that financing the new green ventures alone will not be enough We would need credible transition plans for existing emitting firms without compromising their output or growth For this to materialise central banks can incorporate climaterelated risks into their supervisory frameworks and can contribute to the development of frameworks and standards for green finance These frameworks can help promote transparency standardization and integrity in the green finance market 15 Over the years Reserve Bank has been taking various policy measures to promote and support green finance initiatives For example finance to renewable energy projects have been included as a part of Priority Sector Lending PSL portfolio of banks Earlier this year the Reserve Bank supported Government of India in successfully issuing sovereign green bonds SGrBs The proceeds of the SGrBs are intended to be deployed in public sector projects which will help in reducing the carbon intensity of the economy The issuance of SrGBs would also help in price discovery for other financial instruments and give a fillip to development of a market for green financing ecosystem in the country 16 Recognising that climate change can translate into climaterelated financial risks for Regulated Entities REs and that it can also have broader financial stability implications the Reserve Bank had brought out a discussion paper in July 2022 to elicit views from all the stakeholders Based on the feedback and suggestions received we have issued the instructions for acceptance of Green Deposits while a disclosure framework on Climaterelated Financial Risks and guidance on Climate Scenario Analysis and Stress Testing is also under works The recently released Report on Currency and Finance 2022231 with the theme Towards a Cleaner Greener India has examined the macrofinancial implications of climate change and the possible fiscal monetary regulatory and other policy options for India 17 Global understanding of systemic impact of climate change on the economy and the financial system is evolving and accordingly the responses of central banks and supervisors around the world have also been developing We need to undertake a largescale capacity building effort to equip central banks financial firms real economy players to understand assess and plan for the climate issues and related financial risks Only then would they be able to innovate make strategic decisions mobilise capital and build effective transition plans for achieving sustainability targets One very important aspect of this capacity building is going to be the handholding of the smaller firms and MSMEs to make it easier for them to navigate the transition 18 Another point to note is that we all are in the same boat and action of any one entity will have consequences for all Therefore global cooperation and collective efforts are very important An important factor in finding a solution to manage the climate risk is that it needs to account for emission contributions of countries in the past When we measure the per capita emission instead of absolute emission or consider consumptionbased emissions instead of productionbased emissions the highincome countries stand out for their contribution in global CO2 emissions Unfortunately it is also a reality that while we all face the fury of the climate change middle and lower income countries bear a disproportionate share of the costs in terms of loss in production capacity property damage wealth loss and impact on general health and wellbeing Any solution therefore must factor the cumulative carbon space used by countries 19 On ground implementation of various climate finance commitments from advanced economies has been far from satisfactory and the gap between what is being done and what needs to be done is only growing As against the amount of US 100 billion pledged by advanced economies only US 833 billion has been provided in 2020 an increase of just 4 per cent from 2019 This trend needs to reverse 20 To conclude dealing with climate change is going to be a long haul for all of us There are going to be situations and circumstances when other issues and concerns may come into focus and get prioritized but we should not lose sight of longterm goal of planned and coordinated efforts to deal with the impacts of climate change The earlier we all act the better the outcome Thank you 1

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1371&fn=2,Date Some perspectives on Banking Supervision,Banks are fundamental to the nations financial system The central bank has a critical role to play in ensuring the safety and soundness of the banking systemand in maintaining financial stability and public confidence in this system Mr Mangal Goswami Executive Director SEACEN Centre Mr Raihan Zamil Senior Advisor Financial Stability Institute Directors of Supervision of AsiaPacific Economies Ladies and gentlemen A very good morning to all of you The Reserve Bank is delighted to host this Conference of Directors of Supervision SEACEN Research and Training Centre and FSI have curated an excellent lineup of topics that are both timely and pertinent covering key banking risks in the AsiaPacific region lessons learnt from recent bank failures in the US and Europe and strategies for building resilience in banks In the dynamic world of finance it is imperative that we constantly adapt and learn from past experiences to navigate the challenges that lie ahead This Conference serves as a platform to exchange insights and foster collaboration towards a stronger and more resilient banking sector in the AsiaPacific 2 In the aftermath of the recent bank failures abroad banking supervisors face the challenging task of finding a delicate balance between ensuring financial stability on the one hand and addressing the moral hazard implications of their actions on the other By implementing prudent regulations conducting effective riskbased supervision promoting transparency doing timely interventions and maintaining independence and accountability supervisors can strive to strike an optimum balance that fosters stability while minimizing moral hazard risks ultimately contributing to a resilient and sustainable banking sector which can support the real economy 3 Indeed supervisors have come a long way from being mere regulatory compliance enforcers to becoming riskassessors New supervisory tools aim to instil a forwardlooking and calibrated supervisory approach based on principles of proportionality and risk perception This approach involves constant focus on emerging risks and the business models at the Supervised Entities SEs 4 Today I would like to share my perspective on some of the emerging issues the Indian experience and a few areas that I believe are important for supervisors to focus upon Emerging Issues 5 In the everevolving landscape of banking several emerging challenges have surfaced necessitating adequate attention and proactive measures I would like to discuss three important issues 6 Firstly banking is undergoing a significant technology revolution driven by the emergence of Fintech companies This is pushing traditional banks to embrace digital transformation and become agile and innovative While technology brings numerous benefits such as increased efficiency and improved customer experiences it also presents varied risks Banks must therefore carefully manage the adoption of new technologies and ensure adequate controls and safeguards to address potential vulnerabilities Additionally the reliance on thirdparty technology providers requires robust due diligence and risk management practices to mitigate the risks associated with outsourcing 7 Secondly closely linked to technology is the issue of data The banking industry by the nature of its business possesses a wealth of data that can be leveraged for various purposes This data covers customer information financial transactions credit histories and more While there are significant opportunities to derive value from this data it is crucial to acknowledge and address the inherent risks associated with its handling including those relating to data breaches and privacy concerns 8 Thirdly in an increasingly interconnected world there are geopolitical and macroeconomic risks Political instability and trade tensions can have farreaching implications on banks customers which in turn can put pressure on the banks themselves Similarly macroeconomic developments such as the recent coordinated monetary tightening can transmit risks to the banking sector 9 Thus more than ever before there is a need for both banks and banking supervisors to build capacities to handle technological advancements and navigate uncertain waters This would entail enhancing knowledge and skills and investing in technology with a longterm vision Indian Perspective 10 Now let me brief you on some of the works done in India 11 India as one of the fastestgrowing economies in the world has witnessed significant transformation in its banking sector in recent period From being saddled with high nonperforming assets poor capital adequacy level and significant losses the Indian banking sector today reflects strength stability and resilience thanks to the joint efforts of the Government RBI and the banks themselves 12 Over the past few years the Reserve Bank has significantly enhanced its supervisory systems transitioning from an entitybased approach to a more thematic and activitybased one Structural changes have been implemented in the Supervisory architecture to improve agility bring flexibility and enhance specialization A unified and harmonized supervisory approach has been adopted for commercial banks nonbanking financial companies NBFCs and urban cooperative banks UCBs with greater emphasis on identifying and addressing the root causes of identified vulnerabilities 13 To enhance the effectiveness of supervisory frameworks the Reserve Bank has employed various analytical tools These include an Early Warning System Stress Testing models Vulnerability Assessments Cyber Key Risk Indicators Phishing and Cyber reconnaissance exercises targeted evaluations of compliance with KYCAML norms and MicroData Analytics among others Additionally the Reserve Bank is in the process of adopting Advanced Analytics Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning into supervisory data while taking necessary safeguards to gain even deeper insights into the operations of supervised entities These initiatives reflect the Reserve Banks commitment towards harnessing the power of technology and datadriven approaches to strengthen its supervision 14 Realising the importance of adequate skill and capacity building in supervisors the Reserve Bank has set up a dedicated College of Supervisors CoS The College has been conducting a large number of general and specialised training programmes An Integrated Learning Management System has also been rolled out to facilitate continuous learning and updation Focus areas for Supervisors 15 Moving forward I would like to emphasize nine specific areas where supervisory rigor should be directed more emphatically 16 Firstly governance is of paramount importance and invariably at the root cause of supervisory concerns Effective corporate governance and sound regulation go hand in hand reinforcing each other The recent bank failures in advanced economies have underscored the pressing need to address governance concerns headon 17 Secondly supervisors must closely examine the business models adopted by banks and meticulously assess whether these models align with the institutions risk appetite This evaluation should delve into the level of business growth projections sustainability of earnings potential extent of diversification provisioning cover and appropriate pricing mechanisms etc 18 Thirdly supervisors need to examine IT issues holistically It is crucial to determine whether banks have the capacity to develop robust IT systems that align with their business strategies Futureproofing by banks of their IT infrastructure becomes imperative necessitating strategic investments in both capital and operational expenditure As virtual work environments and cyber risks become more prevalent effective IT governance takes on heightened significance 19 Fourthly supervisors must focus on the efficacy of assurance functions viz risk management compliance and internal audit The assurance functions serve as a critical safeguard providing independent and objective assessment of the banks operations risk management practices and compliance with regulatory requirements By assessing the quality of the assurance functions supervisors can identify potential vulnerabilities assess the effectiveness of internal controls and mitigate risks before they become bigger 20 Fifthly the Compliance culture at the entire organisation level is another critical area that demands supervisory attention While evaluating an institutions culture may pose challenges supervisors must ascertain whether the compliance permeates horizontally and vertically within the institution and gets support from the senior management of the entity 21 Sixthly Communication is an indispensable tool for banking supervisors It facilitates the effective transmission of expectations to Supervised Entities supports compliance with regulations promotes collaboration enhances crisis management capabilities and fosters public trust By prioritizing clear and transparent communication supervisors can strengthen their oversight role and contribute to a stable and resilient banking system 22 Seventh as banking supervisors play a crucial role in maintaining financial stability and safeguarding the interests of depositors intervening in a timely manner and utilizing supervisory powers judiciously is of paramount importance To do so it would be useful for supervisors to develop a formal escalation matrix for supervisory intervention that provides a structured approach for supervisors to determine the appropriate level of intervention and the corresponding actions to be taken 23 Eighth data analytics empowers supervisors with the ability to extract valuable insights from vast amounts of data This enables them to make datadriven decisions identify risks and take timely actions to safeguard financial stability By leveraging the power of data analytics banking supervisors can considerably strengthen their supervisory frameworks 24 Lastly supervisors must strengthen their market intelligence capabilities Media inputs including social media can be extremely useful in identifying emerging issues Whistleblower complaints often viewed as channels for redressal have also become valuable sources of market intelligence Importance of Capacity Building 25 Before I conclude I would like to highlight the importance of capacity building As banks adopt new technologies it is essential for supervisors to be equipped with the necessary knowledge skills and resources to effectively supervise and regulate these advancements 26 In todays rapidly evolving banking landscape supervisors cannot afford to stay behind the curve It is essential for banking supervisors to stay abreast of industry developments enhance their supervisory techniques promote consistent standards and strengthen risk management practices to address emerging challenges 27 Capacity building through recruiting adequate number of quality staff and equipping them with the right skills and tools is an ongoing process that empowers supervisors to fulfil their roles in maintaining the stability and soundness of the banking sector Conclusion Let me now conclude 28 By staying abreast of technological advancements monitoring the evolving risk landscape keeping pace with regulatory developments building necessary capacities and skills and adopting latest analytical tools supervisors can more effectively fulfil their role in maintaining financial stability protecting consumers and fostering a resilient banking sector Learning from past experiences and collaborating across jurisdictions can help better navigate the challenges ahead This can contribute to building a strong banking sector that supports sustainable economic growth in the AsiaPacific region The Conference provides this platform and I believe that it shall prove to be very useful for all the participants My best wishes to all of you Thank You

in ensuring the safety and soundness of the banking systemand in maintaining financial stability and public confidence in this system Q 1 Certain aspects of Master Direction on Regulatory Framework for Microfinance Loans may require additional time for drafting of new policies getting boardlevel approvals making changes in technology systems training of staff etc Whether the timeline for complete rollout of these directions may be extended while keeping the effective date as April 1 2022 Ans The effective date of these directions is April 1 2022 However in view of implementation related difficulties expressed by some regulated entities REs REs are advised to implement these directions completely at the earliest on best effort basis but not later than October 1 2022 Q 2 Whether all members of a household are mandatorily required to become borrowers of a microfinance loan Ans The directions require assessment of income and indebtedness at household level There is no requirement of treating all members of the household as applicants borrowers of a loan which can be provided to an individual member Boardapproved policies of REs may include the methodologies operational frameworks to assess income and indebtedness of all members of the household Q 3 Whether loans for consumption ie for buying gadgets meeting expenses on ceremonies etc without collateral would be treated as microfinance loans Ans All collateralfree loans to individuals belonging to lowincome households ie households having annual income up to 300000 are treated as microfinance loans Q 4 If a loan is backed by hypothecation of any security gold equipment white goods underlying assets etc will this loan be considered collateralfree and classified as a microfinance loan Ans Loans backed by hypothecation of any security shall not be treated as microfinance loans Q 5 Whether the instructions related to limit of 50 per cent on monthly loan repayment obligations of a household as a percentage of monthly household income apply to nonmicrofinance loans given to lowincome households Ans Yes for providing a nonmicrofinance loan to a lowincome household as defined under the directions it should be ensured that the limit of 50 per cent on monthly loan repayment obligations of a household as a percentage of monthly household income is not breached In other words the limit of 50 per cent shall include both microfinance as well as nonmicrofinance loans Q 6 How should credit facilities not having an EMI feature be treated for arriving at total monthly repayment obligations of the household Ans Boardapproved policies of REs should cover such operational aspects One possible way could be to distribute the annualized repayment obligations over twelve months to estimate monthly outgo of the household towards debt repayment Q 7 Can expected income from an asset activity financed by a microfinance loan be included for estimation of household income Ans No Q 8 What type of insurance charges are to be disclosed in the factsheet and included for computation of effective annualized interest rate Whether charges related to noncredit products should also be provided in the factsheet Ans The insurance charges included in the factsheet are only for credit linked insurance product as these charges are linked to the microfinance loan A borrower would not have incurred these charges if he had not taken the loan The factsheet should contain information related to only pricing of microfinance loans to keep it uncluttered Disclosures related to other noncredit products should be provided separately from the factsheet as mentioned under para 7151 of the directions All noncredit products both financial products such as investment products insurance products etc as well as nonfinancial products such as solar lanterns sewing machines etc should be provided only with the explicit consent of the borrower and REs should ensure that there is no direct or indirect linkage between the loan provided to the borrower and other noncredit products No noncredit product shall be sold as a precondition for the loan product REs should prominently display2 that purchase of any noncredit product by the microfinance borrowers is purely on a voluntary basis Boardapproved Fair Practices Code of the REs as mentioned under para 7113 of the directions should also cover this aspect Q 9 Are REs allowed to review and revise interest rates applicable to existing loans during the loan tenure apart from cases of restructured loans Ans The directions are

compliance with the relevant guidelines Q 10 Is the practice of calling a borrower before 900 am and after 600 pm being considered as harsh practice only for recovery of overdue loans or also for normal conduct of business Ans This clause is applicable only for recovery from borrowers having overdue loans For other borrowers REs can continue with the existing timing process for business like group meetings collection in regular accounts etc as per borrowers convenience Q 11 Is there any specific reason for including a dedicated mechanism for redressal of recovery related grievances when there is already a customer grievance redress mechanism Ans The purpose of having a dedicated redress mechanism for recovery related grievances is that these grievances should be promptly addressed Treating clubbing them as with other complaints eg operational issues may result in delayed action However this does not imply that a separate redress mechanism for recovery related grievances is being mandated REs can restructure reorganise the existing customer grievance redress mechanism to identify and promptly address recovery related grievances Q 12 What is the purpose of assessment of household expenses as provided under AnnexI on Indicative Methodology for Household Income Assessment Does it mean that household income for computing the limit on loan repayment obligations of a household is the household income net of expenses Ans Annex I provides only an indicative methodology for assessment of household income and REs are required to put in place a boardapproved policy for household income assessment References to household expenses and assessment of household profile are only for the purpose of validation of the household income reported by the borrowers Q 13 Is the regulatory framework for microfinance loans applicable to all entities operating in the microfinance sector including trusts and societies Ans The regulatory framework for microfinance loans is applicable only to REs entities as defined under para 214 and para 925 of the directions However it may be prudent for other lenders operating in the microfinance sector to follow these

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_FAQs.aspx?Id=83&fn=2,Automated Data Flow,Banks are fundamental to the nations financial system The central bank has a critical role to play in ensuring the safety and soundness of the banking systemand in maintaining financial stability and public confidence in this system Automated Data Flow ADF from banks to Reserve Bank of India The Reserve Bank of India has placed on its website an Approach Paper describing the goals and objectives of Automated Data Flow ADF and advised the banks to implement Automated Data Flow The approach paper can be accessed through the link Home Press Releases November 11 2010 Banks have been individually seeking clarification from RBI officials on ADF Consolidated questions and responses are presented as FAQs on ADF Frequently Asked Questions FAQs on ADF 1 WHAT IS THE BACKGROUND FOR ADF In several of its functions Reserve Bank of India relies on data submitted by banks and quality of data is of great importance In order to meet the need for correct and consistent data the Reserve Bank of India has initiated the project on Automated Data Flow ADF 2 WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE OF ADF ADF seeks to ensure submission of correct and consistent data from the banks straight from their systems to Reserve Bank without any manual intervention 3 WHY IS ADF THOUGHT OF NOW With CBS in banks it is felt that time has come to utilize CBS system capabilities to meet requirements like MIS ADF etc in addition to regular transactional activities 4 WHETHER ANY SPECIFIC APPROACH HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED No specific approach has been recommended for achieving ADF due to the reason that various banks are at different levels of IT and Process maturity However the Approach Paper on ADF clearly articulates the common end state for achieving the objectives of ADF 5 WHETHER ANY PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY OR PROCESS HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED FOR ADF No specific Technology Vendor Service Provider or Process has been recommended for achieving ADF and it has been left to the banks to decide on these issues on the basis of internal requirements 6 HOW DO BANKS ASSESS THEIR LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGY AND PROCESS MATURITY TO IMPLEMENT ADF Banks can refer to the methodology given in the Approach Paper to assess People Process and Technology maturity and place themselves in a specific cluster which in turn would help in determining the time lines for implementation of ADF 7 WHAT IS THE MEANING OF DIRECTLY FROM SOURCE SYSTEM WITHOUT ANY MANUAL INTERVENTION IN THE CONTEXT OF ADF Direct from the source system without any manual intervention implies that whatever data and information is available in CBS and other IT systems of the banks would be submitted to the regulator without any manual aggregation conversion or filling of data Activities like collecting or collating of data from diverse source systems and compiling them into RBI prescribed formats manually would fall within the meaning of manual intervention 8 WHETHER ANY DATA DEFINITION REPORTING FORMAT RATIONALISATION OF RETURNS ETC HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED UNDER ADF PROJECT No It is clarified that requirement under ADF is restricted to ensuring that data as available in the banks source systems is submitted to Reserve Bank without any manual intervention All returns statement and reports prescribed by RBI to be submitted by banks fall under the ADF project 9 WHETHER DATA WILL BE PUSHED OR PULLED UNDER ADF For the present the priority under ADF is to ensure that the banks put in place a system which will ensure quality of data compiled from source systems of banks to be submitted to RBI After a verifiable system has been put in place by all banks it will be decided in due course as to what arrangements would be best suited for flow of data from banks 10 WHETHER ADF IMPLEMENTATION WILL BE PIECEMEAL OR HOLISTIC Banks are free to go ahead with a holistic plan by designing and implementing longterm solutions However the banks need to implement ADF for the returns committed under their roadmaps Further the returns identified by Reserve Bank for immediate implementation in a time bound manner also need to be brought under ADF 11 WHETHER ANY TIMELINES HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED FOR ADF The total time for complete implementation of ADF would depend on the cluster in which the bank places itself after making an assessment of Process and Technology maturity as per the methodology given in the Approach Paper However it is expected that the banks with advanced IT systems and experience of working in computerised environment would take the lead and implement ADF in shortest possible time say even 23 months In general banks should strive to meet the objectives within shortest possible timelines 12 WHAT LEVEL OF GRANULARITY IS DESIRABLE IN ADF The granularity to be built in the system should be able to meet the current requirements of regulatory reporting as prescribed by various departments of Reserve Bank However over and above this banks are free to determine and have a finer granularity not only to meet ad hoc requirements of RBI from time to time but also for internal MIS 13 WHICH ALL RETURNS ARE APPLICABLE TO A BANK A list of returns generally applicable to the banks has been made available in the Approach Paper However every bank is required to work on all the RBI returns applicable to it 14 IS A ROADMAP ESSENTIAL PART OF ADF Yes The Roadmap to be prepared as per the recommendations of the Approach Paper would enable the banks to set milestones for achieving ADF which in turn would also help in monitoring from time to time the progress made in implementation 15 WHAT ABOUT RETURNS REQUIRING QUALITATIVE INPUTS Such returns which require qualitative or subjective inputs and narrations may be considered for classification as complex returns by the banks and may be taken up for implementation towards the end of the project

instructions guidelines on the subject issued till date as listed in the Annex 9 Yours faithfully Manoranjan Mishra Chief General Manager Encl As above Master CircularIncome Recognition Asset Classification Provisioning and Other Related Matters General 11 In order to reflect a banks actual financial health in its balance sheet and as per the recommendations made by the Committee on Financial System Chairman Shri M Narasimham the Reserve Bank has introduced in a phased manner prudential norms for income recognition asset classification and provisioning for the advances portfolio of the banks 12 Broadly the policy of income recognition should be objective and based on record of recovery rather than on any subjective considerations Likewise the classification of assets of banks has to be done on the basis of objective criteria which would ensure a uniform and consistent application of the norms The provisioning should generally be made on the basis of the classification of assets into different categories 13 The requirements of the State Cooperative Societies Acts and or rules made thereunder or other statutory enactments may continue to be followed if they are more stringent than those prescribed hereby 2 Nonperforming Assets NPA 21 Classification of Assets as NonPerforming 211 A nonperforming asset is a loan or an advance where i Interest and or installment of principal remain overdue1 for a period of more than 90 days in respect of a Term Loan ii The account remains out of order2 in respect of an Overdraft Cash Credit ODCC and all other loan products being offered as an overdraft facility including those not meant for business purposes andor which entail interest repayments as the only credits iii The bill remains overdue for a period of more than 90 days in the case of bills purchased and discounted iv In the case of direct agricultural advances as listed in Annex 1 the overdue norm specified at para 213 would be applicable In respect of agricultural loans other than those specified in Annex 1 identification of NPAs would be done on the same basis as nonagricultural advances v Any amount to be received remains overdue for a period of more than 90 days in respect of other accounts vi In addition an account may also be classified as NPA in terms of certain specific provisions of this Master Circular including inter alia paragraphs 227 and clarifications provided under the frequently asked questions FAQs in Annex4 212 A The exact due dates for repayment of a loan frequency of repayment breakup between principal and interest examples of SMANPA classification dates etc should be clearly specified in the loan agreement and the borrower should be apprised of the same at the time of loan sanction and also at the time of subsequent changes if any to the sanction termsloan agreement till full repayment of the loan 212 B Credit Card Accounts In credit card accounts the amount spent is billed to the card users through a monthly statement with a definite due date for repayment Banks give an option to the card users to pay either the full amount or a fraction of it ie minimum amount due on the due date and rollover the balance amount to the subsequent months billing cycle A credit card account will be treated as nonperforming asset if the minimum amount due as mentioned in the statement is not paid fully within 90 days from the payment due date mentioned in the statement Banks shall report a credit card account as past due to credit information companies CICs or levy penal charges viz late payment charges etc if any only when a credit card account remains past due for more than three days The number of days past due and late payment charges shall however be computed from the payment due date mentioned in the credit card statement 213 Agricultural Advance i In respect of all direct agricultural advances as specified in Annex 1 a A loan granted for short duration crops will be treated as NPA if the installment of principal or interest thereon remains overdue for two crop seasons b A loan granted for long duration crops will be treated as NPA if the installment of principal or interest thereon remains overdue for one crop season ii For the purpose of these guidelines long duration crops would be crops with crop season longer than one year and crops which are not long duration crops would be treated as short duration crops iii The crop season for each crop which means the period up to harvesting of the crops raised would be as determined by the State Level Bankers Committee in each state iv Depending upon the duration of crops raised by an agriculturist the above NPA norms would also be made applicable to agricultural term loans availed by him v Banks should ensure that while granting loans and advances realistic repayment schedules are fixed on the basis of cash flows fluidity with the borrowers 214 Identification of Assets as NPAs should be done on an ongoing basis i The system should ensure that identification of NPAs is done on an ongoing basis and accounts are classified as NPA immediately as soon as they turn into NPA as per the guidelines contained in this circular without waiting till the end of quarterfinancial year Banks should also make provisions for NPAs as at the end of each calendar quarter ie as at the end of March June September December so that the income and expenditure account for the respective quarters as well as the PL account and balance sheet for the year end reflects the provision made for NPAs ii The borrower accounts shall be flagged as overdue by banks as part of their dayend processes for the due date irrespective of the time of running such processes Similarly classification of borrower accounts as SMA3 as well as NPA shall be done as part of dayend process for the relevant date and the SMA or NPA classification date shall be the calendar date for which the day end process is run In other words the date of SMANPA shall reflect the asset classification status of an account at the dayend of that calendar date Example If due date of a loan account is March 31 2022 and full dues are not received before the bank runs the dayend process for this date the date of overdue shall be March 31 2022 If it continues to remain overdue then this account shall get tagged as SMA1 upon running dayend process on April 30 2022 ie upon completion of 30 days of being continuously overdue Accordingly the date of SMA1 classification for that account shall be April 30 2022 Similarly if the account continues to remain overdue it shall get tagged as SMA2 upon running dayend process on May 30 2022 and if continues to remain overdue further it shall get classified as NPA upon running dayend process on June 29 2022 iii UCBs having total assets of 2000 crore or above as on March 31 2020 were required to implement systembased asset classification4 with effect from June 30 2021 iv UCBs having total assets of 1000 crore or above but less than 2000 crore as on March 31 2020 and having selfassessed themselves as being under Level III or Level IV in terms of the circular DoSCOCSITEBC40833101052201920 dated December 31 2019 on Comprehensive Cyber Security Framework for UCBs were required to implement systembased asset classification with effect from September 30 2021 v UCBs which meet the above criteria as at the end of the financial year 20202021 or subsequent financial years shall implement systembased asset classification within a period of six months from the end of the financial year concerned For smooth implementation of the system such UCBs may conduct pilotparallel run and evaluate the results for accuracyintegrity of the asset classification in compliance with the applicable RBI instructions so as to ensure that they are ready for implementation of the systembased asset classification from the appointed date vi UCBs not meeting the above criteria are also encouraged to voluntarily implement the systembased asset classification in their own interest 215 Charging of Interest at monthly rests i Banks should charge interest at monthly rests in the context of adoption of 90 days norm for recognition of loan impairment wef from the year ended March 31 2004 and consequential need for close monitoring of borrowers accounts ii The charging compounding of interest on agricultural advances would be linked to crop seasons and the instructions regarding charging of interest on monthly rests shall not be applicable to agricultural advances iii Banks should take into consideration due dates fixed on the basis of fluidity with borrowers and harvesting marketing season while charging interest and compound the same if the loan installment becomes overdue in respect of short duration crops and allied agricultural activities 216 Classification as Special Mention Account SMA and Reporting of Large Exposures to Central Repository of Information on Large Credits CRILC UCBs SMA is an account which is exhibiting signs of incipient stress resulting in the borrower defaulting in timely servicing of her debt obligations though the account has not yet been classified as NPA As early recognition of such accounts enables banks to initiate timely remedial actions to prevent their potential slippages into NPAs all UCBs shall classify loansadvances accounts as SMA as under In case of revolving credit facilities like cash credit the SMA subcategories will be as follows ii The abovementioned instructions on classification of borrower accounts into SMA categories are applicable for all loans including retail loans other than agricultural advances governed by crop seasonbased asset classification norms irrespective of size of exposure iii Primary Urban Cooperative Banks UCBs having total assets of 500 crore and above shall report credit information including classification of an account as Special Mention Account SMA on all borrowers having aggregate exposures of 5 crore and above with them to Central Repository of Information on Large Credits CRILC maintained by the Reserve Bank Aggregate exposure shall include all fundbased and nonfund based exposure including investment exposure on the borrower iv UCBs having total assets of 500 crore and above are required to submit CRILC Report on quarterly basis with effect from December 31 2019 Detailed operating instructions have been issued vide circular DoSOSMOSNo46333305018201920 dated January 16 2020 on Reporting of Large Exposures to Central Repository of Information on Large Credits CRILC UCBs by the Department of Supervision Reserve Bank of India v UCBs should take utmost care about data accuracy and integrity while submitting the information data on large credit to RBI failing which penal action as per the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act 1949 may be taken 22 Treatment of Accounts as NPAs 221 Record of Recovery i The treatment of an asset as NPA should be based on the record of recovery Banks should not treat an advance as NPA merely due to existence of some deficiencies which are temporary in nature such as nonavailability of adequate drawing power balance outstanding exceeding the limit nonsubmission of stock statements and the nonrenewal of the limits on the due date etc Where there is a threat of loss or the recoverability of the advances is in doubt the asset should be treated as NPA ii A credit facility should be treated as NPA as per norms given in paragraph 21 above However where entire overdues pertaining to all the credit facilities availed by a borrower from a given bank have been regularised by repayment through genuine sources not by sanction of additional facilities or transfer of funds between accounts the accounts may be upgraded to standard asset category In such cases it should however be ensured that the accounts remain in order subsequently and a solitary credit entry made in an account on or before the balance sheet date which extinguishes the overdue amount of interest or installment of principal is not reckoned as the sole criteria for treatment of the account as a standard asset 222 Treatment of NPAs Borrowerwise and not Facilitywise i In respect of a borrower having more than one facility with a bank all the facilities granted by the bank will have to be treated as NPA and not the particular facility or part thereof which has become irregularNPA ii However in respect of consortium advances or financing under multiple banking arrangements each bank may classify the borrowal accounts according to its own record of recovery and other aspects having a bearing on the recoverability of the advances Each bank shall follow the principle at i above for NPA classification of a borrower 223 Agricultural Advances Default in repayment due to Natural Calamities i Where natural calamities impair the repaying capacity of agricultural borrowers as a relief measure banks may decide on their own to a convert the shortterm production loan into a term loan or reschedule the repayment period and b sanction fresh shortterm loans ii In such cases of conversion or reschedulement the term loan as well as fresh shortterm loan may be treated as current dues and need not be classified as nonperforming asset NPA The asset classification of these loans would therefore be governed by the revised terms and conditions and these would be treated as NPA under the extant norms applicable for classifying agricultural advances as NPAs 224 Housing Loan to Staff In the case of housing loan or similar advances granted to staff members where interest is payable after recovery of principal interest need not be considered as overdue from the first month onwards Such loans advances should be classified as NPA only when there is a default in repayment of instalment of principal or payment of interest on the respective due dates 225 Credit facilities Guaranteed by Central State Government i The credit facilities backed by guarantee of the Central Government though overdue should not be treated as NPA ii This exemption from classification of government guaranteed advances as NPA is not for the purpose of recognition of income iii From the year ended March 31 2006 State Government guaranteed advance and investment in State Government guaranteed securities would attract asset classification and provisioning norms if interest and or principal or any other amount due to the bank remains overdue for more than 90 days irrespective of the fact whether the guarantee have been invoked or not 226 Project Financing Project Loan would mean any term loan which has been extended for the purpose of setting up of an economic venture Banks must fix a Date of Commencement of Commercial Operations DCCO for all project loans at the time of sanction of the loan financial closure in the case of multiple banking or consortium arrangements For the purpose of Income Recognition and Asset Classification norms all project loans may be divided into the following two categories i Project Loans for infrastructure sector ii Project Loans for noninfrastructure sector Detailed guidelines are given in Annex 8 In the case of bank finance given for industrial projects where moratorium is available for payment of interest payment of interest becomes due only after the moratorium or gestation period is over Therefore such amounts of interest do not become overdue and hence NPA with reference to the date of debit of interest They become overdue after due date for payment of interest if uncollected 227 Prudential Guidelines on Restructuring of Advances The prudential guidelines on restructuring of advances are detailed a under a Asset Classification Norms 2271 Restructuring of advances could take place in the following stages before commencement of commercial production operation after commencement of commercial production operation but before the asset has been classified as substandard after commencement of commercial production operation and the asset has been classified as substandard or doubtful 2272 The accounts classified as standard assets should be immediately reclassified as substandard assets upon restructuring 2273 The non performing assets upon restructuring would slip into further lower asset classification category as per extant asset classification norms with reference to the prerestructuring repayment schedule 2274 All restructured accounts which have been classified as nonperforming assets upon restructuring would be eligible for upgradation to the standard category after observation of satisfactory performance during the specified period Annex 5 2275 In case however satisfactory performance during the specified period is not evidenced the asset classification of the restructured account would be governed as per the applicable prudential norms with reference to the prerestructuring payment schedule 2276 Any additional finance may be treated as standard asset up to a period of one year after the first interest principal payment whichever is earlier falls due under the approved restructuring package However in the case of accounts where the prerestructuring facilities were classified as substandard and doubtful interest income on the additional finance should be recognised only on cash basis If the restructured asset does not qualify for upgradation at the end of the above specified one year period the additional finance shall be placed in the same asset classification category as the restructured debt 2277 In respect of loan accounts which enjoy special regulatory treatment as per para 22725 upon restructuring such nonperforming assets would continue to have the same asset classification as prior to restructuring In case satisfactory performance of the account is not evidenced during the specified period it would slip into further lower asset classification categories as per extant asset classification norms with reference to the prerestructuring repayment schedule 2278 In case a restructured asset which is a standard asset on restructuring is subjected to restructuring on a subsequent occasion it should be classified as substandard If the restructured asset is a substandard or a doubtful asset and is subjected to restructuring on a subsequent occasion its asset classification will be reckoned from the date when it became NPA on the first occasion However such advances restructured on second or more occasion may be allowed to be upgraded to standard category after one year from the date of first payment of interest or repayment of principal whichever falls due earlier in terms of the current restructuring package subject to satisfactory performance b Income Recognition Norms 2279 Subject to provisions of paragraphs 2276 and 22722 interest income in respect of restructured accounts classified as standard assets will be recognized on accrual basis and that in respect of the account classified as non performing assets will be recognized on cash basis c Provisioning Norms 22710 Normal Provisions Banks will hold provision against the restructured advances on the basis of classification of assets into prescribed categories as detailed in paragraph 3 below 22711 Provision for Diminution in the Fair Value of restructured Advances The erosion in the fair value of the advance should be computed as the difference between the fair value of the loan before and after restructuring Fair value of the loan before restructuring will be computed as the present value of cash flows representing the interest at the existing rate charged on the advance before restructuring and the principal discounted at a rate equal to the banks BPLR as on the date of restructuring plus the appropriate term premium and credit risk premium for the borrower category on the date of restructuring Fair value of the loan after restructuring will be computed as the present value of cash flows representing the interest at the rate charged on the advance on restructuring and the principal discounted at a rate equal to the banks BPLR as on the date of restructuring plus the appropriate term premium and credit risk premium for the borrower category on the date of restructuring 22712 It may please be noted that the above formula moderates the swing in the diminution of present value of loans with the interest rate cycle and will have to be followed consistently in future 22713 Further it is reiterated that the provisions required as above arise due to the action of the banks resulting in change in contractual terms of the loan upon restructuring which are in the nature of financial concessions These provisions are distinct from the provisions which are linked to the asset classification of the account classified as NPA and reflect the impairment due to deterioration in the credit quality of the loan Thus the two types of the provisions are not substitute for each other 22714 It is also reemphasised that the guidelines on restructuring of advances by RBI are aimed at providing an opportunity to banks and borrowers to preserve the economic value of the units and should not be looked at as a means to evergreen the advances 22715 In their published annual Balance Sheets banks shall make disclosures as per Annex6 22716 In the case of working capital facilities the diminution in the fair value of the cash credit overdraft component may be computed as indicated in para 22711 above reckoning the higher of the outstanding amount or the limit sanctioned as the principal amount and taking the tenor of the advance as one year The term premium in the discount factor would be as applicable for one year The fair value of the term loan components Working Capital Term Loan and Funded Interest Term Loan would be computed as per actual cash flows and taking the term premium in the discount factor as applicable for the maturity of the respective term loan components 22717 In the event any security is taken in lieu of the diminution in the fair value of the advance it should be valued at Re1 This will ensure that the effect of charging off the economic sacrifice to the Profit Loss account is not negated 22718 The diminution in the fair value may be recomputed on each balance sheet date till satisfactory completion of all repayment obligations and full repayment of the outstanding in the account so as to capture the changes in the fair value on account of changes in BPLR term premium and the credit category of the borrower Consequently banks may provide for the shortfall in provision or reverse the amount of excess provision held in the distinct account 22719 If due to lack of expertise appropriate infrastructure a bank finds it difficult to ensure computation of diminution in the fair value of advances extended by small branches as an alternative to the methodology prescribed above for computing the amount of diminution in the fair value banks will have the option of notionally computing the amount of diminution in the fair value and providing therefore at five percent of the total exposure in respect of all restructured accounts where the total dues to banks are less than rupees one crore 22720 The total provisions required against an account normal provisions plus provisions in lieu of diminution in the fair value of the advance are capped at 100 of the outstanding debt amount d Prudential Norms for Conversion of Unpaid Interest into Funded Interest Term Loan FITL 22721 Asset Classification Norms The FITL created by conversion of unpaid interest will be classified in the same asset classification category in which the restructured advance has been classified Further movement in the asset classification of FITL would also be determined based on the subsequent asset classification of the restructured advance 22722 Income Recognition Norms i The income if any generated may be recognised on accrual basis if FITL is classified as standard and on cash basis in the cases where the same has been classified as a nonperforming asset ii The unrealised income represented by FITL should have a corresponding credit in an account styled as Sundry Liabilities Account Interest Capitalization iii Only on repayment in case of FITL the amount received will be recognized in the PL Account while simultaneously reducing the balance in the Sundry Liabilities Account Interest Capitalisation e Special Regulatory Treatment for Asset Classification 22723 The special regulatory treatment for asset classification in modification to the provisions in this regard stipulated in para 2271 to 2278 will be available to the borrowers engaged in important business activities subject to compliance with certain conditions as enumerated in para 22728 below Such treatment is not extended to the following categories of advances i Consumer and personal advances including advances to individuals against the securities of shares bonds debentures etc ii Advances to traders 22724 The asset classification of the above two categories of accounts as well as that of other accounts which do not comply with the conditions enumerated in para 22728 will be governed by the prudential norms in this regard described in para 2271 to 2278 above f Elements of Special Regulatory Framework 22725 The special regulatory treatment has the following two components i Incentive for quick implementation of the restructuring package ii Retention of the asset classification of the restructured account in the pre restructuring asset classification category 22726 Incentive for Quick Implementation of the Restructuring Package During the pendency of the application for restructuring of the advance with the bank the usual asset classification norms would continue to apply The process of reclassification of an asset should not stop merely because the application is under consideration However as an incentive for quick implementation of the package if the approved package is implemented by the bank within 90 days from the date of receipt of application by the bank the asset classification status may be restored to the position which existed when the restructuring application was received by the bank 22727 Asset Classification Benefits Subject to the compliance with the undernoted conditions in addition to the adherence to the prudential framework laid down in para 2271 to 2278 i In modification to para 2272 an existing standard asset will not be downgraded to the substandard category upon restructuring ii In modification to para 2273 during the specified period the asset classification of the substandard doubtful accounts will not deteriorate upon restructuring if satisfactory performance is demonstrated during the specified period 22728 However these benefits will be available subject to compliance with the following conditions i The dues to the bank are fully secured as defined in Annex 5 The condition of being fully secured by tangible security will not be applicable in the following cases a SSI borrowers where the outstanding is up to 25 lakh b infrastructure projects provided the cash flows generated from these projects are adequate for repayment of the advance the financing banks have in place an appropriate mechanism to escrow the cash flows and also have a clear and legal first claim on these cash flows c WCTL created by conversion of the irregular portion of principal dues over the drawing power subject to the condition that provisions are made against the unsecured portion of the WCTL as under Standard Assets 20 Substandard Assets 20 during the first year and to be increased by 20 every year thereafter until the specified period one year after the first payment is due under the terms of restructuring If the account is not eligible for upgradation after the specified period the unsecured portion will attract provision of 100 ii The unit becomes viable in 10 years if it is engaged in infrastructure activities and in 7 years in the case of other units iii The repayment period of the restructured advance including the moratorium if any does not exceed 15 years in the case of infrastructure advances and 10 years in the case of other advances The Board of Directors of the banks should prescribe the maximum period not exceeding 15 years for restructured advances keeping in view the safety and soundness of advances iv Promoters sacrifice and additional funds brought by them should be a minimum of 15 of banks sacrifice v Personal guarantee is offered by the promoter except when the unit is affected by external factors pertaining to the economy and industry vi The restructuring under consideration is not a repeated restructuring as defined in para iv of Annex 5 g Disclosures 22729 Banks should disclose in their published annual Balance Sheets under Notes on Accounts information relating to number and amount of advances restructured and the amount of diminution in the fair value of the restructured advances in Annex 6 h Illustrations 22730 A few illustrations on the asset classification of restructured accounts are given in Annex 7 22731 Resolution of Covid19 related stress implemented under the following circulars shall be subject to the specific requirements including the prudential requirements

requirements specified therein 228 Other Advances i Advances against term deposits NSCs eligible for surrender KVPs and Life policies need not be treated as NPAs although interest thereon may not have been paid for more than 90 days provided adequate margin is available in the accounts ii Banks should fix monthly quarterly instalments for repayment of gold loans for nonagricultural purposes taking into account the pattern of income generation and repayment capacity of the borrowers and such gold loan accounts may be treated as NPAs if instalments of principal and or interest thereon are overdue for more than 90 days iii As regards gold loans granted for agricultural purposes interest is required to be charged as per Supreme Court judgment at yearly intervals and payment should coincide with the harvesting of crops Accordingly such advances will be treated as NPA only if instalments of principal and or interest become overdue after due date 229 Recognition of Income on Investment Treated as NPAs The investments are also subject to the prudential norms on income recognition Banks should not book income on accrual basis in respect of any security irrespective of the category in which it is included where the interest principal is in arrears for more than 90 days 2210 NPA Reporting to Reserve Bank Banks should report the figures of NPAs to the Regional Office of the Reserve Bank at the end of each year within two months from the close of the year in the prescribed proforma given in the Annex 2 2211 Consumer Education on SMANPA With a view to increasing awareness among the borrowers banks should place consumer education literature on their websites explaining with examples the concepts of date of overdue SMA and NPA classification and upgradation with specific reference to dayend process Banks should also consider displaying such consumer education literature in their branches by means of posters andor other appropriate media Further it shall also be ensured that their frontline officers educate borrowers about all these concepts with respect to loans availed by them at the time of sanctiondisbursalrenewal of loans 3 Asset Classification 31 Classification 311 Banks should classify their assets into the following broad groups viz i Standard Assets ii Substandard Assets iii Doubtful Assets iv Loss Assets 32 Definitions 321 Standard Assets Standard asset is one which does not disclose any problems and which does not carry more than normal risk attached to the business Such an asset should not be an NPA 322 Substandard Assets With effect from March 31 2005 an asset would be classified as substandard if it remained NPA for a period less than or equal to 12 months In such cases the current net worth of the borrowers guarantors or the current market value of the security charged is not enough to ensure recovery of the dues to the banks in full In other words such assets will have well defined credit weaknesses that jeopardise the liquidation of the debt and are characterised by the distinct possibility that the banks will sustain some loss if deficiencies are not corrected 323 Doubtful Assets With effect from March 31 2005 an asset is required to be classified as doubtful if it has remained NPA for more than 12 months A loan classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent as that classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently known facts conditions and values highly questionable and improbable 324 Loss Assets A loss asset is one where loss has been identified by the bank or internal or external auditors or by the Cooperation Department or by the Reserve Bank of Indias inspection but the amount has not been written off wholly or partly In other words such an asset is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted although there may be some salvage or recovery value 33 Guidelines for Classification of Assets 331 Basic Considerations i Broadly speaking classification of assets into above categories should be done taking into account the degree of well defined credit weaknesses ii In respect of accounts where there are potential threats to recovery on account of erosion in the value of security it will not be prudent for the banks to classify them first as substandard and then as doubtful after expiry of 12 months from the date the account has become NPA Such accounts should be straight away classified as doubtful asset or loss asset as appropriate irrespective of the period for which they have remained as NPA 332 Advances Granted under Rehabilitation Packages Approved by Term Lending Institutions i Banks are not permitted to upgrade the classification of any advance in respect of which the terms have been renegotiated unless the package of renegotiated terms has worked satisfactorily for a period of one year While the existing credit facilities sanctioned to a unit under rehabilitation packages approved by term lending institutions will continue to be classified as substandard or doubtful as the case may be in respect of additional facilities sanctioned under the rehabilitation packages the income recognition and asset classification norms will become applicable after a period of one year from the date of disbursement ii A similar relaxation be made in respect of SSI units which are identified as sick by banks themselves and where rehabilitation packages nursing programmes have been drawn by the banks themselves or under consortium arrangements 333 Internal System for Classification of Assets as NPA i Banks may adhere to the timelines for implementation of systembased asset classification mentioned at paragraph 214 above ii Banks which are not required to implement systembased asset classficiation in terms of the instructions at paragraph 214 should establish appropriate internal systems to eliminate the tendency to delay or postpone the identification of NPAs especially in respect of high value accounts The banks may fix a minimum cutoff point to decide what would constitute a high value account depending upon their respective business levels The cutoff point should be valid for the entire accounting year iii Responsibility and validation levels for ensuring proper asset classification may be fixed by the bank iv The system should ensure that doubts in asset classification due to any reason are settled through specified internal channels within one month from the date on which the account would have been classified as NPA as per extant guidelines v Banks should ensure scrupulous compliance with the instructions for recognition of credit impairment and view aberrations by dealing officials seriously vi RBI would continue to identify the divergences arising due to noncompliance for fixing accountability Where there is wilful noncompliance by the official responsible for classification and is well documented RBI would initiate deterrent action including imposition of monetary penalties 4 Income Recognition 41 Income Recognition Policy 411 The policy of income recognition has to be objective and based on the record of recovery Income from nonperforming assets NPA is not recognised on accrual basis but is booked as income only when it is actually received Therefore banks should not take interest on nonperforming assets to their income account on accrual basis 412 However interest on advances against term deposits NSCs KVPs and life insurance policies may be taken to income account on the due date provided adequate margin is available in the accounts 413 Fees and commissions earned by the banks as a result of renegotiations or rescheduling of outstanding debts should be recognised on an accrual basis over the period of time covered by the renegotiated or rescheduled extension of credit 414 If Government guaranteed advances remain overdue for more than 90 days the interest on such advances should not be taken to income account unless the interest has been realised This shall be applicable in cases of both Central and State Government guaranteed accounts 415 In cases of loans where moratorium has been granted for repayment of interest banks may recognize interest income on accrual basis for accounts which continue to be classified as standard This shall be evaluated against the definition of restructured accounts provided at slno iii of Annex5 to this Master Circular 42 Reversal of Income on Accounts Becoming NPAs 421 If any advance including bills purchased and discounted becomes NPA interest accrued and credited to income account should be reversed or provided for if the same is not realised This will also apply to Government guaranteed accounts which remain overdue for more than 90 days 422 However if loans with moratorium on payment of interest permitted at the time of sanction of the loan become NPA after the moratorium period is over the capitalized interest if any corresponding to the interest accrued during such moratorium period need not be reversed 423 In respect of NPAs fees commission and similar income that have accrued should cease to accrue in the current period and should be reversed with respect to past periods if uncollected 424 Banks undertaking equipment leasing should follow prudential accounting standards Lease rentals comprises of two elements a finance charge ie interest charge and a charge towards recovery of the cost of the asset The interest component alone should be taken to income account Such interest component taken to income account before the asset became NPA if unrealised should be reversed or provided for 43 Booking of Income on Investments in Shares Bonds 431 As a prudent practice and in order to bring about uniform accounting practice among banks for booking of income on units of UTI and equity of All India Financial Institutions such income should be booked on cash basis and not on accrual basis 432 However in respect of income from Government securities bonds of public sector undertakings and All India Financial Institutions where interest rates on the instruments are predetermined income may be booked on accrual basis provided interest is serviced regularly and is not in arrears 44 Partial Recovery of NPAs Interest realised on NPAs may be taken to income account provided the credits in the accounts towards interest are not out of fresh additional credit facilities sanctioned to the borrower concerned 45 Interest Application 451 In case of NPAs as a prudential norm there is no use in debiting the said account by interest accrued in subsequent months and taking this accrued interest amount as income of the bank as the said interest is not being received It is simultaneously desirable to show such accrued interest separately or park in a separate account so that interest receivable on such NPA account is computed and shown as such though not accounted as income of the bank for the period 452 The interest accrued in respect of performing assets may be taken to income account as the interest is reasonably expected to be received However if interest is not actually received for any reason in these cases and the account is to be treated as an NPA then the amount of interest so taken to income should be reversed or should be provided for in full 453 With a view to ensuring uniformity in accounting the accrued interest in respect of both the performing and nonperforming assets the following guidelines may be adopted notwithstanding the existing provisions in the respective State Cooperative Societies Act i Interest accrued in respect of nonperforming advances should not be debited to borrowal accounts but shown separately under Interest Receivable Account on the Property and Assets side of the balance sheet and corresponding amount shown under Overdue Interest Reserve Account on the Capital and Liabilities side of the balance sheet ii In respect of borrowal accounts which are treated as performing assets accrued interest can alternatively be debited to the borrowal account and credited to Interest account and taken to income account In case the accrued interest in respect of the borrowal account is not actually realised and the account has become NPA interest accrued and credited to income account should be reversed or provided for iii The illustrative accounting entries to be passed in respect of accrued interest on both the performing and nonperforming advances are indicated in the Annex 3 454 In the above context it may be clarified that overdue interest reserve is not created out of the real or earned income received by the bank and as such the amounts held in the Overdue Interest Reserve Account cannot be regarded as reserve or a part of the owned funds of the banks It will also be observed that the Balance Sheet format prescribed under the Third Schedule to the Banking Regulation Act 1949 As Applicable to Cooperative Societies specifically requires the banks to show Overdue Interest Reserve as a distinct item on the Capital and Liabilities side vide item 8 thereof 5 Provisioning Norms 51 Norms for Provisioning on Loans Advances 511 In conformity with the prudential norms provisions should be made on the nonperforming assets on the basis of classification of assets into prescribed categories as detailed in paragraph 3 above 512 Taking into account the time lag between an account becoming doubtful of recovery its recognition as such the realisation of the security and the erosion over time in the value of security charged to the bank the banks should make provision against loss assets doubtful assets and substandard assets as below i Loss Assets The entire assets should be written off after obtaining necessary approval from the competent authority and as per the provisions of the Cooperative Societies Act Rules If the assets are permitted to remain in the books for any reason 100 per cent of the outstanding should be provided for ii Doubtful Assets a Provision should be 100 per cent of the extent to which the advance is not covered by the realisable value of the security to which the bank has a valid recourse The realisable value should be estimated on a realistic basis b In regard to the secured portion provision may be made on the following basis at the rates ranging from 20 per cent to 100 per cent of the secured portion depending upon the period for which the asset has remained doubtful iii Substandard Assets A general provision of 10 per cent on total outstanding should be made without making any allowance for ECGC guarantee cover and securities available iv Provision on Standard Assets a The standard asset provisioning norms applicable to Tier I Tier 2 Tier 3 and Tier 4 UCBs as categorized under the revised regulatory framework5 shall be as under Direct advances to agriculture and SME sectors which are standard shall attract a uniform provisioning requirement of 025 percent of the funded outstanding on a portfolio basis Advances to commercial real estate CRE sector which are standard shall attract a uniform provisioning requirement of 100 percent of the funded outstanding on a portfolio basis Advances to commercial real estate residential housing CRERH6 sector which are standard provision requirement shall be 075 percent For all other advances banks shall maintain a uniform general standard asset provision of a minimum of 040 per cent of the funded outstanding on a portfolio basis b The standard asset provisioning requirements for all UCBs are summarized as under c The erstwhile Tier I UCBs which are currently maintaining standard asset provision of 025 on all other loans and advances not included above are permitted to achieve the provisioning requirement of 040 on such advances in a staggered manner by March 31 2025 Thus provision on all such standard loans and advances outstanding as on March 31 2023 shall be increased to 030 by March 31 2024 to 035 by September 30 2024 and to 040 by March 31 2025 d The provisions towards standard assets need not be netted from gross advances but shown separately as Contingent Provision against Standard Assets under Other Funds and Reserves item2 viii of Capital and Liabilities in the Balance Sheet e In case banks are already maintaining excess provision than what is required prescribed by Statutory Auditor RBI Inspection for impaired credits under Bad and Doubtful Debt Reserve additional provision required for Standard Assets may be segregated from Bad and Doubtful Debt Reserve and the same may be parked under the head Contingent Provisions against Standard Assets with the approval of their Board of Directors Shortfall if any on this account may be made good in the normal course f The above contingent provision will be eligible for inclusion in Tier II capital v Higher Provisions There is no objection if the banks create bad and doubtful debts reserve beyond the specified limits on their own or if provided in the respective State Cooperative Societies Acts 52 Provisioning for Retirement Benefits Banks may have retirement benefit schemes for their staff viz Provident Fund Gratuity and Pension It is necessary that such liabilities are estimated on actuarial basis and full provision should be made every year for the purpose in their Profit and Loss Account 53 Provisioning Pertaining to Fraud Accounts With effect from May 14 2015 provisioning norm in respect of all cases of fraud identified in terms of the Master Circular on Frauds Classification and Reporting as updated from time to time are as under 531 The entire amount due to the bank irrespective of quantum of security held against such assets or for which the bank is liable including in case of deposit accounts is to be provided for over a period not exceeding four quarters commencing with the quarter in which the fraud has been detected 532 However where there has been delay beyond the prescribed period in reporting the fraud to Reserve Bank the entire provisioning is required to be made at once In addition Reserve Bank of India may also initiate appropriate supervisory action where there has been delay by the bank in reporting a fraud or provisioning there against 54 Guidelines for Provisions in Specific Cases i State Government guaranteed Advances From the year ended March 31 2006 State Government guaranteed advance and investment in State Government guaranteed securities would attract extant provisioning norms on the basis of classification of assets into prescribed categories as detailed in paragraph 3 above ii Advances granted under Rehabilitation Packages approved by Term Lending Institutions a The existing credit facilities sanctioned to a unit under rehabilitation package approved by term lending institutions should continue to be classified as substandard or doubtful asset as the case may be b However the additional facilities sanctioned as per package finalised by term lending institutions the income recognition and asset classification norms will become applicable after a period of one year from the date of disbursement c In respect of additional credit facilities granted to SSI units which are identified as sick and where rehabilitation packages nursing programmes have been drawn by the banks themselves or under consortium arrangements no provision need be made for a period of one year iii Advances against fixed term deposit NSCs eligible for surrender KVPs and life policies are exempted from provisioning requirements iv Advances against gold ornaments government securities and all other kinds of securities are not exempted from provisioning requirements v Advances covered by ECGC Guarantee a In the case of doubtful assets which are guaranteed by ECGC provision should be made only for the balance in excess of the amount guaranteed by the Corporation Further while arriving at the provisioning required realisable value of the securities should first be deducted from the outstanding balance in respect of the amount guaranteed by the Corporation and then provision made as illustrated hereunder b Banks have the option of following more stringent method of provisioning in respect of advances covered by the guarantees of ECGC as compared to the method given above vi Exposures guaranteed by Credit Guarantee Schemes In terms of circular DORSTRREC672106201202223 dated September 07 2022 banks have been permitted to apply zero risk weight to advances guaranteed by Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises CGTMSE Credit Risk Guarantee Fund Trust for Low Income Housing CRGFTLIH and

Primary Urban Cooperative Banks UCBs under All Inclusive Directions The interbank exposures arising from deposits placed by UCBs with a UCB under AID and their nonperforming exposures arising from discounted bills drawn under LCs issued by a UCB under AID shall be fully provided within five years at the rate of 20 annually Further the interest receivable on the deposits shall not be recognised

under a scheme of restructuring revival of a UCB under AID provision on the portion of deposits converted into such instruments shall not be required 6 Transfer of Loan Exposures The asset classification and provisioning requirements in respect of transactions involving transfer of loans shall be as per the Reserve Bank of India Transfer of Loan Exposures Directions 2021 7 Clarification on certain frequently asked questions is given at Annex 4 Annex 1vide para 213 Direct Finance to Agriculture 11 Finance to Individual Farmers for Agriculture and Allied Activities Dairy Fishery Piggery Poultry Beekeeping etc Loans to individual farmers including Self Help Groups SHGs or Joint Liability Groups JLGs ie groups of individual farmers provided banks maintain disaggregated data on such loans engaged in Agriculture and Allied Activities viz dairy fishery animal husbandry poultry beekeeping and sericulture up to cocoon stage 12 Loans to others such as corporates partnership firms and institutions for Agriculture and Allied Activities dairy fishery piggery poultry beekeeping etc up to an aggregate limit of 2 crore per borrower for the following purposes i Shortterm loans for raising crops ie for crop loans This will include traditionalnontraditional plantations horticulture and allied activities ii Medium longterm loans for agriculture and allied activities eg purchase of

purchase of land for agricultural purposes vi Loans to distressed farmers indebted to noninstitutional lenders against appropriate collateral vii Export credit for exporting their own farm produce Annex 4 Clarification on certain frequently asked questions vide para 7 1 Whether a working capital account will become an NPA if the stock statements are not submitted regularly What should be the period for which the stock statements can be in arrears before the account is treated as an NPA Banks should ensure that drawings in the working capital accounts are covered by the adequacy of current assets since current assets are first appropriated in times of distress Considering the practical difficulties of large borrowers stock statements relied upon by the banks for determining drawing power should not be older than three months The outstanding in the account based on drawing power calculated from stock statements older than three months would be deemed as irregular A working capital borrowal account will become NPA if such irregular drawings are permitted in the account for a continuous period of 90 days 2 Whether an account will become an NPA if the review renewal of regular adhoc credit limits are not done when due What should be periodicity of review renewal to decide the present status of an account Banks shall adhere to the instructions contained in the Master Circular for Urban Cooperative Banks UCBs on Management of Advances UCBs dated April 8 2022 as updated from time to time regarding the requirement of policy for periodic review of the working capital limits Further banks shall also adhere to the instructions issued vide circular DoSCOPPGBC11101005202021 dated August 21 2020 on AdhocShort ReviewRenewal of Credit Facilities incuding inter alia the requirement of a detailed Board approved policy on methodology and periodicity for reviewrenewal of credit facilities within the overall regulatory guidelines and strict adherence to the same An account where the regular adhoc credit limits have not been reviewed or have not been renewed within 90 days from the due date date of adhoc sanction will be treated as NPA In case of constraints such as nonavailability of financial statements and other data from the borrowers the branch should furnish evidence to show that renewal review of credit limits is already on and would be completed soon 3 Regularisation of the account around the date of balance sheet Whether it will be in order to treat a borrowal account as standard if it has been irregular for a major part of the year but has been regularised near the balance sheet date The asset classification of borrowal accounts where a solitary or a few credits are recorded before the balance sheet date should be handled with care and without scope for subjectivity Where the account indicates inherent weakness on the basis of the data available the account should be deemed as a NPA In other genuine cases the banks must furnish satisfactory evidence to the Statutory Auditors Inspecting Officers about the manner of regularisation of the account to eliminate doubts on their performing status 4 Classification of NPAs where there is a threat to recovery How should the instructions on classification of NPAs straightaway as doubtful or a loss asset be interpreted and what can be termed as a significant credit impairment An NPA need not go through the various stages of classification in case of serious credit impairment and such assets should be straightway classified as a doubtful loss asset as appropriate Erosion in the value of security can be reckoned as significant when the realizable value of the security is less than 50 per cent of the value assessed by the bank or accepted by RBI at the time of last inspection as the case may be Such NPAs may be straightaway classified under doubtful category and provisioning should be made as applicable to doubtful assets 5 Classification of credit facilities under consortium In certain cases of consortium accounts though the record of recovery in the account with a member bank may suggest that the account is a NPA the banks submit that at times the borrower has deposited adequate funds with the consortium leader member of the consortium and the banks share is due for receipt In such cases will it be in order for the member bank to classify the account as standard in its books Asset classification of accounts under consortium should be based on the record of recovery of the individual member banks and other aspects having a bearing on the recoverability of the advances Where the remittances by the borrower under consortium lending arrangements are pooled with one bank and or where the bank receiving remittances is not parting with the share of other member banks the account will be treated as not serviced in the books of the other member banks and therefore be treated as NPA The banks participating in the consortium should therefore arrange to get their share of recovery transferred from the lead bank or get an express consent from the lead bank for the transfer of their share of recovery to ensure proper asset classification in their respective books 6 Appropriation of recoveries What is the practice to be adopted by banks regarding appropriation of recoveries in NPA accounts In the absence of a clear agreement between the bank and the borrower for the purpose of appropriation of recoveries in NPAs ie towards Principal or interest due banks should adopt an accounting principle and exercise the right of appropriation of recoveries in a uniform and consistent manner 7 Overdues in other credit facilities There are instances where banks park the dues from a borrower in respect of devolved letters of credit and invoked guarantees in a separate account irrespective of whether the borrowers credit facilities are regular or not How to determine when the account in which such dues are parked has become an NPA A number of banks adopt the practice of parking the dues of the borrower in respect of devolved letters of credit and invoked guarantees in a separate account which is not a regular sanctioned facility As a result these are not reflected in the principal operating account of the borrower This renders application of the prudential norms for identification of NPAs difficult It is therefore advised that if the debts arising out of devolvement of letters of credit or invoked guarantees are parked in a separate account the balance outstanding in that account also should be treated as a part of the borrowers principal operating account for the purpose of application of prudential norms on income recognition asset classification and provisioning 8 Treatment of loss assets An NPA account will be classified as a loss asset only when there is no security in the account or where there is considerable erosion in the realisable value of the security in the account What can be termed as a considerable erosion for the account to be classified as a loss asset If the realisable value of the security as assessed by the bank approved valuers RBI is less than 10 per cent of the outstanding in the borrowal accounts the existence of security should be ignored and the asset should be straightaway classified as loss asset It may be either written off after obtaining necessary permission from the competent authority as per the Cooperative Societies Act Rules or fully provided for by the bank 9 Valuation of Security A major source of divergence in provisioning requirement was the realisable value of the primary and collateral security Can uniform guidelines be prescribed for adoption in this area at least for large value accounts With a view to bringing down divergence arising out of difference in assessment of the value of security it has been decided that in cases of NPAs with balance of 10 lakh and above a The current assets and their valuation are looked into at the time of Statutory Audit Concurrent audit However in order to enhance the reliability on stock valuations stock audit at annual intervals by external agencies could be considered in case of larger advances The cut off limit and the names of the external agencies may be finalised by the Board Annex 5 Prudential Guidelines on Restructuring of Advances Key Concepts i Advances The term Advances will mean all kinds of credit facilities including cash credit overdrafts term loans bills discounted purchased receivables etc and investments other than that in the nature of equity ii Fully Secured When the amounts due to a bank present value of principal and interest receivable as per restructured loan terms are fully covered by the value of security duly charged in its favour in respect of those dues the banks dues are considered to be fully secured While assessing the realisable value of security primary as well as collateral securities would be reckoned provided such securities are tangible securities and are not in intangible form like guarantee etc of the promoter others However for this purpose the bank guarantees State Government Guarantees and Central Government Guarantees will be treated on par with tangible security iii Restructured Accounts A restructured account is one where the bank for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrowers financial difficulty grants to the borrower concessions that the bank would not otherwise consider Restructuring would normally involve modification of terms of the advances securities which would generally include among others alteration of repayment period repayable amount the amount of instalments rate of interest due to reasons other than competitive reasons iv Repeatedly Restructured Accounts When a bank restructures an account a second or more times the account will be considered as a repeatedly restructured account However if the second restructuring takes place after the period up to which the concessions were extended under the terms of the first restructuring that account shall not be reckoned as a repeatedly restructured account v SMEs Small and Medium Enterprises as defined in terms of the circular FIDDMSME NFSBCNo4060231202021 dated August 21 2020 on New Definition of Micro Small and Medium Enterprises clarificationsas updated from time to time vi Specified Period Specified Period means a period of one year from the date when the first payment of interest or installment of principal falls due under the terms of restructuring package vii Satisfactory Performance Satisfactory performance during the specified period means adherence to the following conditions during that period NonAgricultural Cash Credit Accounts In the case of nonagricultural cash credit accounts the account should not be out of order any time during the specified period In addition there should not be any overdues at the end of the specified period NonAgricultural Term Loan Accounts In the case of nonagricultural term loan accounts no payment should remain overdue for a period of more than 90 days In addition there should not be any overdues at the end of the specified period All Agricultural Accounts In the case of agricultural accounts at the end of the specified period the account should be regular Annex 6 vide para 22729 Prudential Guidelines on Restructuring of Advances Annex 8vide para 226 Guidelines on Asset Classification of Projects under Implementation Banks must fix a Date of Commencement of Commercial Operations DCCO for all project loans at the time of sanction of the loan financial closure7 in the case of multiple banking or consortium arrangements For the purpose of IRAC norms all project loans may be divided into the following two categories i Project Loans for infrastructure sector ii Project Loans for noninfrastructure sector 1 Project Loans for Infrastructure Sector 11 A loan for an infrastructure project will be classified as NPA during any time before commencement of commercial operations as per record of recovery 90 days overdue unless it is restructured and becomes eligible for classification as standard asset in terms of paras13 and 14 below 12 A loan for an infrastructure project will be classified as NPA if it fails to commence commercial operations within two years from the original DCCO even if it is regular as per record of recovery unless it is restructured and becomes eligible for classification as standard asset in terms of paras 13 and 14 below 13 There may be occasions when completion of projects is delayed for legal and other extraneous reasons like delays in Government approvals etc All these factors which are beyond the control of the promoters may lead to delay in project implementation and involve restructuring rescheduling of loans by banks If a project loan classified as standard asset is restructured any time during the period up to two years from the original date of commencement of commercial operations DCCO in accordance with prudential guidelines on restructuring of advances at paragraph 227 above it can be retained as a standard asset if the fresh DCCO is fixed within the following limits and further provided the account continues to be serviced as per the restructured terms a Infrastructure Projects involving Court Cases Up to another 2 years beyond the existing extended period of 2 years ie total extension of 4 years in case the reason for extension of date of commencement of production is arbitration proceedings or a court case b Infrastructure Projects delayed for other reasons beyond the Control of Promoters Up to another 1 year beyond the existing extended period of 2 years ie total extension of 3 years in other than court cases 14 The dispensation in para 13 is subject to the condition that the application for restructuring should be received before the expiry of period of two years from the original DCCO and when the account is still standard as per record of recovery The other conditions applicable would be i In cases where there is moratorium for payment of interest banks should not book income on accrual basis beyond two years from the original DCCO considering the high risk involved in such restructured accounts ii Banks should maintain provisions on such accounts as long as these are classified as standard assets as under For the purpose of these guidelines mere extension of DCCO will also be treated as restructuring even if all other terms and conditions remain the same 2 Project Loans for NonInfrastructure Sector 21 A loan for a noninfrastructure project will be classified as NPA during any time before commencement of commercial operations as per record of recovery 90 days overdue unless it is restructured and becomes eligible for classification as standard asset in terms of paras 23 and 24 below 22 A loan for a noninfrastructure project will be classified as NPA if it fails to commence commercial operations within six months from the original DCCO even if it is regular as per record of recovery unless it is restructured and becomes eligible for classification as standard asset in terms of paras 23 and 24 below 23 In case of noninfrastructure projects if the delay in commencement of commercial operations extends beyond the period of six months from the date of completion as determined at the time of financial closure banks can prescribe a fresh DCCO and retain the standard classification by undertaking restructuring of accounts in accordance withprudential guidelines on restructuring of advances at paragraph 227 above provided the fresh DCCO does not extend beyond a period of twelve months from the original DCCO This would among others also imply that the restructuring application is received before the expiry of six months from the original DCCO and when the account is still standard as per the record of recovery The other conditions applicable would be a In cases where there is moratorium for payment of interest banks should not book income on accrual basis beyond six months from the original DCCO considering the high risk involved in such restructured accounts b Banks should maintain provisions on such accounts as long as these are classified as standard assets as under 24 For this purpose mere extension of DCCO will also be treated as restructuring even if all other terms and conditions remain the same 3 These guidelines will however not be applicable to restructuring of commercial real estate and housing loans 4 Other Issues 41 All other aspects of restructuring of project loans before commencement of commercial operations would be governed by the instructions on restructuring of advances as contained in this Master Circular 42 Any change in the repayment schedule of a project loan caused due to an increase in the project outlay on account of increase in scope and size of the project would not be treated as restructuring if i The increase in scope and size of the project takes place before commencement of commercial operations of the existing project ii The rise in cost excluding any costoverrun in respect of the original project is 25 or more of the original outlay iii The bank reassesses the viability of the project before approving the enhancement of scope and fixing a fresh DCCP iv On rerating if already rated the new rating is not below the previous rating by more than one notch Definition of Infrastructure Lending Any credit facility in whatever form extended by lenders ie banks FIs or NBFCs to an infrastructure facility as specified below falls within the definition of infrastructure lending In other words a credit facility provided to a borrower company engaged in developing or operating and maintaining or developing operating and maintaining any infrastructure facility that is a project in any of the following sectors or any infrastructure facility of a similar nature a road including

testing facilities for quality construction of educational institutions and hospitals laying down and or maintenance of gas crude oil and petroleum pipelines any other infrastructure facility of similar nature Annex 9 A List of Circulars consolidated in the Master Circular B List of Other Circulars from which instructions have also been consolidated in the Master Circular 1 Any amount due to the bank under any credit facility if not paid by the due date fixed by the bank becomes overdue 2 An account should be treated as out of order if i the outstanding balance in the CCOD account remains continuously in excess of the sanctioned limitdrawing power for 90 days orii the outstanding balance in the CCOD account is less than the sanctioned limitdrawing power but there are no credits continuously for 90 days or the outstanding balance in the CCOD account is less than the sanctioned limitdrawing power but credits are not enough to cover the interest debited during the previous 90 days period The aforesaid previous 90 days period is inclusive of the day for which the dayend process is being run 3 Refer paragraph 216 4 Systembased asset classification would mean asset classification downgrading as well as upgrading carried out by the CBS computerized systems of the bank in an automated manner on an ongoing basis based on the relevant RBI instructionsguidelines 5 As per circular DORREGNo840701000202223 dated December 01 2022 6 CRERH would consist of loans to buildersdevelopers for residential housing projects except for captive consumption under CRE segment Such projects should ordinarily not include nonresidential commercial real estate However integrated housing projects comprising some commercial space eg shopping complex school etc can also be classified under CRERH provided that the commercial area in the residential housing project does not exceed 10 of the total Floor Space Index FSI of the project In case the FSI of the commercial area in the predominantly residential housing complex exceeds the ceiling of 10 the project loans should be classified as CRE and not CRERH 7 For greenfield projects financial closure is defined as a legally binding commitment of equity holders and debt financiers to provide or mobilise funding for the project Such funding must account for a significant part of the project cost which should not be less than 90 per cent of the total project cost securing the construction of the facility

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=903&fn=14,Date Banks in India Challenges Opportunities,This role is perhaps the most unheralded aspect of our activities yet it remains among the most critical This includes ensuring credit availability to the productive sectors of the economy establishing institutions designed to build the countrys financial infrastructure expanding access to affordable financial services and promoting financial education and literacy Smt Arundhati Bhattacharya Chairman State Bank of India Shri Deepak Parekh Chairman HDFC Shri V G Kannan Chairman SBI Cap Securities Ltd Shri Mani Palivesan Managing Director SBI Cap Securities Ltd distinguished panelists and participants It is a pleasure to address the BFSI Conference 2014 which features panel discussions on topical issues in banking The first panel discussion interestingly is on Disruptive Themes for Next Decade The word disruptive is usually used with a negative connotation and therefore to be chosen as the theme for the panel discussion is a bold decision On a careful rethinking it seems disruptions can be used as synonym for challenges posed by paradigm shifts in the environment thereby questioning the way things are done today These challenges are opening the opportunities which banks should harness if they want to remain relevant in the financial service space in India Therefore in my address I intend to focus on some of these challenges opportunities 2 As at endMarch 2013 there were 155 commercial banks including 151 scheduled commercial banks SCBs of which Regional Rural Banks were 64 The total number of bank offices at endMarch 2014 is estimated to have reached 115014 and the population per office 110052 In terms of the regional spread of the bank offices while North Eastern region accounted for about 2 per cent 2785 bank offices Southern region accounted for about 28 per cent 30925 bank offices Despite such vast expansion of banking network banking penetration still remains relatively low According to the CRISILs financial inclusion index Inclusix which covers three parameters of branch penetration deposit penetration and credit penetration at all India level the index is placed on a scale of 100 at 401 in 2011 reflecting under penetration of formal banking facilities in most part of the country While the Southern region witnessed highest financial inclusion with index at 622 NorthEastern region registered lowest with 285 Underpenetration is evident in terms of number of ATMs and POS per million population also In India it stood at about 94 and 695 respectively as compared to say 1200 and 4853 respectively in Russia The credit to GDP ratio is at around 53 per cent which is low compared to the creditGDP ratio of many advanced developing economies Hence there is a need for much greater banking and credit penetration going forward This is so because despite efforts to develop the corporate bond market the Indian financial system remains bankdominated with commercial banks accounting for over 60 per cent of the financial sector assets It is therefore essential for the Indian economy striving for an accelerating sustainable and inclusive growth in the medium to longterm to have a healthy and growing banking system 3 Indian banking in future is thus expected to grow exponentially supported by technology intensive processes and customer friendly models with focus on convenience and cost effectiveness A report titled Indian Banking 2020 Making Decades Promise come True brought out by the Boston Consulting Group in 2010 had identified ten broad trends for the Indian banking These and a few other areas which should receive the attention of banks seeking opportunities for sustainable growth are summarized below Retail banking will be immensely benefited from the Indian demographic dividend It is important to note that the middle class population is expected to touch 200 million by 2020 and 475 million by 20272 This would imply mortgages would grow fast and likely to cross 40 trillion by 2020 Another segment that will provide huge opportunities will be the financing of affordable housing for growing low middle class Rapid accumulation of wealth in rich households will drive wealth management to 10X size The Next Billion consumer segment will emerge as the largest in terms of numbers and will accentuate the demand for low cost banking solutions and innovative operating models throwing up a big market of small customers Branches and ATMs will need to grow 2X and 5X respectively to serve the huge addition to bankable population Low cost branch network with smaller sized branches will be adopted Mobile banking will come of age with widespread access to internet on mobile reaping the benefit of the high mobile density in the country Banks will adopt CRM and data warehousing in a major way to reduce customer acquisition costs and improve risk management Banks will have to understand and adopt new technologies like cloud computing and invest significantly in analytics based on big data Margins will see downward pressure both in retail and corporate banking spurring banks to generate more fees and improve operating efficiency Banks will discover the importance of the SME segment for profitability and growth and new models to serve SME segment profitably will be found as more than three fourth of the segment is still waiting to be served Investment banking will grow 10X driven by demand from corporates for transaction support and capital market access and Infrastructure debt will surpass 45 trillion half of which will be on banks books It will touch the ALM limits of banks and will require a significant upgrade of banks risk management systems The focus of agricultural financing will be on areas like endtoend supply chain management various aggregation models of financing organic and other niche areas of agriculture Rural banking predominantly will have to harness branchless models and alternative channels of service Although banks will continue to focus on domestic business given the rising trend of globalization crossborder banking business will need more attention As per a recent World Bank report India retained its topmost position with US 70 billion in remittances in 2013 followed by China US 60 billion the Philippines US 25 billion Mexico US 22 billion Nigeria US 21 billion Egypt US 17 billion Pakistan US 15 billion and Bangladesh US 14 billion Apart from remittances and deposit investment related transactions originating from the growing Indian diaspora India has been witnessing a significant increase in trade finance and outward direct investments In other words banks will need to gear up to reap the benefits of increasing business arising out of globalization of India and resident and nonresident Indians It has now been realized that manufacturing will have to be one of the key drivers of growth though in the recent past with moderation in the growth rate the sector also witnessed a slowdown A recent report of the McKinsey Global Institute3 observes that for making a substantial improvement in the standards of living of the Indian people and alleviating poverty about 115 million new nonfarm jobs will have to be created between 2012 and 2022 and of these about 27 million new jobs need to be created in manufacturing The required growth rate in manufacturing sector output needs to be at least 10 per cent a year probably higher The National Manufacturing Policy envisages share of manufacturing in GDP to 25 per cent by 2022 Achieving this rate of growth would require significant amount of financing by the banks Challenges from the regulatory perspective Reorientation of the Indian Banking Structure 5 As the economyexpands a greater quantum of resources will be needed for supporting the growth process The Indian banking sector also needs to catch up the likely acceleration in the credit to GDP ratio as the economy expands To support the economic growth as envisaged in the 12th Five Year Plan the banking business needs to expand significantly to an estimated 288 trillion by 2020 from about 115 trillion in 20124 Given this there is a need for reorienting the banking structure to make it more dynamic and flexible while ensuring safety and systemic stability There is enormous scope for increasing the size and capacity of the banking structure Accordingly the Reserve Bank came out with a set of guidelines for licensing of new banks in the private sector in February 2013 The process of licensing culminated with the granting of inprinciple approval to two applicants who would set up new banks in the private sector within a period of 18 months 6 While announcing the decision to grant inprinciple approval to the two applicants the Reserve Bank indicated that going forward it would use the learning experience from this licensing exercise to revise the guidelines appropriately and move to grant licences more regularly on tap basis Further Reserve Bank would work on a policy of having various categories of differentiated bank licences which will allow a wider pool of entrants into banking leading to greater banking penetration and more competitive environment Reserve Bank has accordingly been working on the relevant guidelines for licensing payment banks and small banks 7 Eventually over the years as visualized in the Discussion Paper the reoriented the banking structure may comprise four tiers The first tier may consist of three or four large universal Indian banks with domestic and international presence along with branches of foreign banks in India The second tier is likely to comprise several midsized banking institutions including niche banks like Payment Banks with economywide presence The third tier may encompass old private sector banks Regional Rural Banks and multi state Urban Cooperative Banks The fourth tier may embrace many small privately owned local banks and cooperative banks Competition 8 W Chan Kim A Renee Mauborgne in their Blue Ocean Strategy have shown that companies can succeed not by battling competitors but rather by creating Blue Oceans of uncontested market space These strategic moves create value for the company its buyers and its employees while unlocking new demand and making the competition irrelevant Unlike the Red Ocean Strategy the conventional approach to business of beating competition the Blue Ocean Strategy tries to align innovation with utility price and cost propositions Similarly financial sector reforms have brought about significant structural changes and created several blue oceans A manifestation of this development is reflected in the increase in bank competitiveness The share of public sector banks PSBs in total banking assets which was 90 per cent on the eve of reforms in 1991 has since declined to around 72 per cent a decline of roughly 1 percentage a year In a move that is further expected to increase competition in the domestic banking industry the Reserve Bank released the framework for setting up of Wholly Owned Subsidiaries WOS by foreign banks to India in November 2013 besides the framework for new universal banks and differentiated banks such as small banks and payment banks which is in the offing As I mentioned above new banks are set to enter banking sector Further banks are facing increasing competition from nonbanks including NBFCs MFIs and tech companies Going ahead there may be increase in the nonbank related financing activities through innovations like PeertoPeer P2P lending5 direct consumer lendings and social investing With increasing competition banks will need to tap into untapped business opportunities This would also call for harnessing resources at the bottom of the pyramid Small customers are as important to their business growth as big business opportunities The challenge before banks would be to make the best use of technology and innovation to bring down intermediation costs while protecting their bottom lines Basel III implementation 9 The implementation of Basel III framework will throw various challenges for banks In particular the adoption of Basel III capital requirements by Indian banks would push down their return on equity RoE to an extent Investors have a wider choice and the stocks of the manufacturing sector may be preferred to banking sector stocks and as such it may perhaps be difficult to convince the investor community to invest in Indian banks in the shortterm It is however expected that by looking at the benefits of implementation of Basel III capital requirements by way of increasing resilience of the banking system investors will get adjusted to the new reality This issue also needs to be seen in a historical perspective to understand the fact that Indian banks have successfully transited in the past from the regime of no regulatory requirement for capital to progressively tighter capital requirements and it would be logical to expect that Indian banks would be able to navigate the current phase as well Nevertheless it needs to be recognized that while moderation of growth in RoE is inevitable the key to cushion this impact is to optimise capital and augment efficiency 10 On June 9 2014 the Reserve Bank issued guidelines for the implementation of the Liquidity Converge Ratio LCR which is a part of the Basel III framework on Liquidity Standards In India the LCR will be introduced in a phased manner starting with a minimum requirement of 60 per cent from January 1 2015 and reaching minimum 100 per cent on January 1 2019 Further Government securities in excess of minimum SLR requirements and the Government securities within the mandated SLR requirement to the extent allowed by the Reserve Bank under Marginal Standing Facility MSF are permitted to be treated as Level 1 assets for the computation of LCR Adoption of liquidity standards under Basel III may induce changes in funding preferences of the Indian banks reflecting the fact that availability of and access to quality liquid assets may be a challenge going forward when the LCR requirement increases incrementally Capital mobilisation 11 In the process of phased adoption of Basel III capital norms Indian banks in general have a relatively comfortable capital adequacy position to begin with Rising required amount of capital going forward would be however a challenge to which I turn now The Reserve Bank issued final guidelines on implementation of Basel III capital regulations on May 2 2012 The guidelines became effective from April 1 2013 in phases and will be fully implemented as on March 31 2019 Though there are various estimates about the additional capital mobilization by the PSBs arising out of the phased implementation of Basel III capital requirements one thing is clear that the required magnitude of capital in the run up to the full implementation will be substantial During the last four years the Government has infused 586 billion in the PSBs The Government has made a provision of 112 billion in the interim budget for 201415 PSBs hold more than 70 per cent of the banking assets Therefore capital infusion from the Government of this order may not be sufficient It is also important to note that there has been over reliance on the Government to infuse equity despite headroom available for the management of the banks to raise equity from markets There have not been concerted efforts made by PSBs to shore up their equity capital base from the markets keeping in view the Basel III capital adequacy requirements Their internal generation of capital has suffered mainly due to sharp deterioration in the asset quality possibly due to adverse selection of assets The growing pressure on asset quality of PSBs and the threat of rating downgrades will further add pressure on the equity of banks Further there would be further requirement of capital based on supervisory review and evaluation process under Basel Pillar II framework 12 With higher additional capital requirements as discussed above recapitalisation of PSBs could exert significant stress on the governments fiscal position There are however several potential options available to meet the challenges of mobilization of additional capital These would include Divestment of Governments shares in PSBs Given the present level of government shareholding in these banks which ranges from 58 per cent to 89 per cent there is substantial ground for raising equity from the market without diluting the public sector character The roles and responsibilities of the Boards of PSBs could be reviewed The effectiveness of the Board and senior management has a moderating effect on the risk profiles and consequently overall capital requirements in a bank The Government being the owner of the PSBs could address the governance aspects concerning PSBs In addition to the public and rights issues banks have other routes available to raise equity in the form of qualified institutions placement QIP and ESOP Boards of PSBs need to explore all the feasible options to raise equity capital Providing tax incentive to investors on investments in banks Tier 1 bonds like tax exemption of interest incomein part or in full with a view to promoting and deepening the market for these bonds may be useful at this stage PSBs may issue nonvoting equity shares to the public thereby while the Government can hold less than 51 per cent of the total equity shares it can still maintain at least 51 per cent voting rights of the total voting equity Similarly the option of issuance of differential voting equity could also be considered These issuances will allow the Government to maintain their voting rights at the desired level even though there may be a dilution in the economic interest ie in terms dividend income to the Government The Governments stake in PSBs can be diluted below 51 per cent in conjunction with certain protective rights given to the Government by amending the respective statutes governing PSBs In this connection the proposals of the Committee to Review Governance of Boards of Banks in India Nayak Committee to transfer the Governments shares in PSBs to an investment company viz Bank Investment Company BIC reduce Government stakes in PSBs to less than 50 percent and provide more autonomy and professionalism to PSBs which are expected to improve the returns on equity and attract more capital from the market apart from reducing provision requirements etc are worth serious consideration and As regards distressed banks in private sector Nayak Committee has also recommended that private equity funds including sovereign wealth funds be permitted to take a controlling stake of 40 percent Asset quality 13 During the quarter ended December 2013 banks collectively held loan provisions of about Rupees one lakh crores an increase of 13 percent over the year indicating that loan asset quality of banks in India deteriorated considerably The trend of yoy growth in gross nonperforming advances GNPA outstripping the yoy growth of advances that started from the quarter ended September 2011 continues although the gap in the growth rates is narrowed6 The PSBs continued to register the highest level of stressed advances at 113 per cent of the total advances as at end March 2014 followed by the old private bank at 58 per cent Though agriculture sector showed the highest GNPA ratio the industry sector showed distinctly high level of restructured standard advances resulting in the stressed advances of the industry sector reaching 156 per cent followed by the services at 79 per cent as at December 2013 There are five subsectors namely infrastructure which includes power generation telecommunications roads ports airports railways other than Indian Railways and others infrastructure iron and steel textiles mining including coal and aviation services had significantly higher level of stress and thus these subsectorssegments were identified as stressed sectors in the banks lending portfolios The share of these five stressed subsectors to the total advances of the SCBs is around 24 per cent Infrastructure has the highest share at 147 per cent in the total advances Among the bankgroups these five subsectors have the highest share at 273 per cent in the case of PSBs 14 It is widely accepted that the economic slowdown has affected the asset quality of banks adversely though the impact is not similar across bank groups Sectorwise and their sizewise analysis of asset quality shows that the GNPA ratio of PSBs across the sectors and their size are significantly higher than the other bankgroups How do we face upto the challenge of deteriorating asset quality of banks Though analysts have often pointed out that the poor asset quality of the banks to a great extent could be attributed to the not so encouraging macroeconomic situation it is expected that the implementation of the new initiatives by the Central Government would address these issues effectively Skeptics though may still point out at factors such as the threat of El Nino which could result in poor monsoon global developments such as quantitative easing etc and geopolitical risks could threaten the performance of banks in India It is also true that even when general economic outlook is healthy the asset quality of banks could still suffer due to inadequacies in credit management There are no short cuts for proper credit appraisals and monitoring Recognising early warning signals and taking timely measures to take care of the weaknesses observed are very important 15 The Reserve Bank on January 30 2014 has issued a Framework to Revitalise the Distressed Assets in the Economy wherein banks would recognise at an early stage the stress in their assets and take prompt steps towards resolution recovery of distressed assets and detailed guidelines in this regard were issued on February 26 2014 The Framework has identified certain structural impediments in the way of smooth resolutionrecovery of stressed assets of banks and suggested steps such as revamping the SARFAESI Act revitalizing DRTs etc and rejuvenating Asset Reconstruction Companies are also being mooted 16 The Reserve Bank of India has set up the Central Repository of Information on Large Credits CRILC to collect store and disseminate data on all borrowers credit exposures including Special Mention Accounts SMA 0 1 2 with aggregate fundbased and nonfund based exposure of 50 million and above The CRILC has started disseminating information on large credit which will reduce credit information asymmetry and improve informed credit decision making by banks Banks will be able to know large common exposures and buildup of leverage in the system Banks will have access to asset classification of individual large exposures by different banks Banks are required to activate the Joint Lenders Forum for initiating corrective actions when a lender reports a borrower as SMA2 to CRILC We have engaged with banks to avoid delay in submission of data and ensure quality and integrity of data It is expected that once it stabilizes the CRILC framework would exert moral pressurediscipline on large borrowers to repay dues in time lest their names appear in SMA2 report and bank managements would be better equipped to assess the health of their high value credit portfolio for initiating timely action Governance 17 As mentioned earlier Nayak Committee has made some major observations regarding governance aspects of banks in India especially that of PSBs According to the Committee there is a need to upgrade the quality of board deliberation in PSBs to provide greater strategic focus Further there are seven themes which appear critical to their mediumterm strengths comprising Business Strategy Financial Reports and their Integrity Risk Compliance Customer Protection Financial Inclusion and Human Resources All other items for discussion should be brought to the Boards by exception and should typically be discussed in committees of boards It is added that among these seven themes identified for detailed board scrutiny predominant emphasis needs to be provided to Business Strategy and Risk dimensions Further the Committee is of the view that as the quality of board deliberations is sensitive to the skills and independence of board members it is imperative to upgrade these skills in boards of PSBs by reconfiguring the entire appointments process Otherwise it is unlikely that these boards will be empowered and effective For this the Government has to move towards establishing fully empowered boards in PSBs solely entrusted with the governance and oversight of the management of the banks The proposed BIC which is expected to hold the shares of the Government in PSBs should commence the process of professionalising and empowering bank boards by reconstituting them and this in turn would help to improve the corporate governance in a big way As per the recommendations of the Committee eventually in phase III all ownership functions would be transferred by BIC to the bank boards The appointments of independent bank directors and wholetime directors including the CEO would become the responsibility of bank boards Equally important from PSBs point of view would be the quality of the top management particularly from the points of view of experience expertise continuity While professionalization and effectiveness of boards of PSBs emerged as a major challenge it is no less as issue with many private sector banks say for example when there is domination of prominent shareholdersCEOs Private sector banks also need to focus on the skillset and profile of their top management and the board of directors Risk Management System in Banks 18 The design of risk management functions should be based on size complexity of business and the quality of MIS The banks should have the necessary skill set available or develop it through proper inhouse capacity building Banks therefore will need to refine and reorient their risk management skills for enterprisewide risk management In addition banks need to have in place a fair and differentiated risk pricing of products and services since capital comes at a cost This involves costing a quantitative assessment of revenue streams from each product and service and an efficient transferpricing mechanism that would determine capital allocation Generally it is observed that some banks put the risk management architecture in place to meet the regulatory requirements without using the risk inputs for taking business decisions The risk is not properly priced for various products The most challenging part is the integrity and reliability of data It must be appreciated that Risk Based Supervision RBS under which all the banks will be covered by the Reserve Bank over a period of time 28 banks were under RBS last year is highly data intensive The risk profile of a bank its rating and most importantly the computation of supervisory capital which are the outputs of RBS are determined on the basis of data and other qualitative information furnished by the banks It may be remembered that supervisory findings also go towards formulation of regulatory guidelines and other macroeconomic policies It is therefore the responsibility of the top managementsBoards of the banks to ensure that this area is given utmost attention HR Management 19 This is an area where most of our banks especially the PSBs are found lacking In their eagerness to expand their core business they tend to forget the relevance of human expertise which drives their business in a sustainable manner The complexities of modern banking and the dependence on IT makes it all the more important why the banks should have requisite manpower with right amount of knowledge and experience at appropriate places Many of the present day ills in Indian banks eg weak appraisal standards not being able to pick up the early warning signals in problem accounts which leads to fraudulent transactions or accounts becoming NPA recurring customer grievances etc can be ascribed to skill gaps in the manpower of the banks Near vacuum in the senior management over the next few years lack of expertise in critical areas like IT risk management credit appraisal and treasury operations absence of succession planning for middle and senior management positions attracting retaining and nurturing fresh talent ad hoc responses to capacity building and poor performance management system are some of the major HR challenges staring the PSBs The proposal of universal and differentiated bank licenses being available on tap will make it tougher for PSBs to retain whatever skilled manpower is available with them In respect of private sector banks the problem in many cases relates to the work culture focussing unduly on achieving unrealistic targets by all means This implies certain aversion towards employment in such banks and could have serious reputation risk implications for them Challenges from the payment systems perspective Financial inclusion through the payments route 20 Leveraging technology enabled payment system for electronic transactions provides challenges and opportunities to the banks by expanding outreach in terms of expanding customer base offering multiple product choices achieving cost efficiency providing assurance in terms of standardization safety and safety Despite the impressive growth in the volume and value of electronic transactions the same is concentrated in metros and big cities thus widening the digital divide This imbalance is reflected along various parameters be it the deployment of ATMs or the POS infrastructure mobile banking services etc Needless to state the vision of financial inclusion aided through the payments path cannot be achieved unless the rural and semiurban areas find an equal footing in the policy horizon for banks 21 While the ultimate goal is to migrate most of the payments to electronic mode we cannot lose sight of the reality that large segment of population is still dependent on cash for daytoday requirements The lopsided development of infrastructure mentioned above also contributes to this challenge Hence from a perspective of achieving inclusive payment system it is also necessary to facilitate remittance and cashhandling requirements of a large segment of society particularly the migrant population The Reserve Bank has already put in place the policy framework under the Guidelines for Domestic Money Transfer DMT and now it is up to the banks to take this forward Towards this end experiments like Cardless cash withdrawal for the unbanked is gaining ground We have recently given inprinciple approval for two entities to take this service forward Of course for this to gain traction active participation of and promotion by banks would be imperative as the delivery channels envisaged in these models are the ATMs and Business Correspondents BCs Standardisation and capacity buildup 22 While any development in offering electronic services is welcome standalone systems not only work in silos but also fragment the market to some extent Hence as the payments ecosystem matures interoperability becomes essential for which standardization in processes and procedures is a prerequisite This not only facilitates uniformity in transaction handling but also enables uniform customer experiences A related point is that of ensuring that systems are not just adequate to meet present needs but also the growing volumes Hence even as the Reserve Bank is building capacity in the systems operated by it for instance the RTGS or NEFT it is equally important for banks to review and upgrade their own infrastructure as well in tune with their policy and expected growth in business Partnerships with nonbanks 23 Even as we have adopted a bank led model for achieving the goal of financial inclusion opportunities have been given to the nonbanks to involve themselves in payments area whether it is through the BC White Label ATMS WLAs or prepaid card routes In many of these areas nonbanks need to work in close coordination with banks It is imperative that banks also see the potential for synergetic growth by partnering with these nonbanks and leveraging on their strengths so as to reap efficiency gains for both the entities a case in point is bankMNO partnership for expanding mobile banking space We have seen instances of such partnership particularly with MNOs acting as BCs Similar developments should occur in other areas too A word of caution is however essential banks cannot abdicate their responsibilities towards customers in ensuring safe and secure services particularly in scenarios where a large part of the activities involved in payments are outsourced In some context we have also observed concentration in a few service providers and banks should take cognizance of this Safety and security of payment transactions 24 Last but not the least is the consideration towards safety and security of payment transactions This goes a long way in influencing customer behavior in the choice of payment methods While the Reserve Bank has mandated many requirements to strengthen security and enhance risk mitigation standards for the electronic transactions it is essential that these are implemented not only in letter but also in spirit Further with the increased volume of transactions the need for Straight Through Processing STP becomes essential Hence while catering to large volumes certain procedural changes would need to be made For example there is the requirement under NEFT and RTGS where the credit is afforded to the beneficiary customers account solely on the basis of the account number given in the remittance request by the sender While the intention behind this policy is to facilitate easier handling of growing volumes at banks through STP the riskbased approach to handle customer grievance should not be lost sight of and banks should also seek to proactively address of the payee and redress customer issues emanating from such electronic transactions Customer as well as frontline staff awareness and education is crucial in ensuring not only acceptability of the payment products but also their assurance in terms of safety and security Concluding Thoughts 25 Finally let me conclude by highlighting that the challenges facing banks as they gear up to the task of funding an economy aspiring to become a middleincome country in the years to come are known knowns But the known unknown is how the banks will be able to adapt to the evolving situation and come on top of it What compounds the matter further is the fact that Indian banks have to operate in an increasingly globalised environment because of which there will be many factors regulatory technological crossborder financial flows impacting them over which they may not have any control In particular Will the banks be able to mobilise required amount of capital from the market for meeting their current and future business growth and prudential requirements Will banks be able to understand the varied and dynamic requirements of its diverse set of clientele and devise customised products Will banks be able to do so in a cost effective manner Will banking be able to attract and retain skilled manpower and leverage them for both for business growth and risk mitigation without sullying their image as responsible and responsive employers Will banks be able to enlarge their outreach in terms of customer base and product choices by leveraging technology enabled payment systems in affordable accessible acceptable and assured manner 1 Keynote address delivered by Shri Harun R Khan Deputy Governor at the BFSI Conference 2014 organized by SBICap Securities on June 12 2014 in Mumbai The

business entities on the online platforms without any role of a traditional financial intermediary like a bank or a nonbanking financial institution Crowd funding is a common term where small amounts of money from large number of individualsorganizations is raised to fund an art work social cause or startup venture through webbased platform The P2P lending is carried out through the websites of

total advances declined to 39 per cent in March 2014 from 42 per cent in September 2013The net nonperforming advances NNPA as percentage of total advances also declined to 20 per cent in March 2014 from 23 per cent in September 2013 This improvement in asset quality was due to the lower slippage of standard advances to nonperforming and a seasonal pattern of higher recovery and writeoffs that generally take place during the last quarter of financial year The stressed advances of SCBs also declined to 96 per cent of total advances as at end March 2014 from 102 per cent of September 2013 This improvement in the asset quality was observed across all the bankgroups

includes ensuring credit availability to the productive sectors of the economy establishing institutions designed to build the countrys financial infrastructure expanding access to affordable financial services and promoting financial education and literacy Guidelines on Digital Lending were issued vide Circular DORCREREC662107001202223 dated September 02 2022 Q 1 Whether a lending transaction would fall under the definition of digital lending only if all the processes in the life cycle of a loan viz customer acquisition credit assessment loan approval disbursement recovery and associated customer service are carried out digitally or some of the aforesaid processes can be carried out in physical mode also Ans The phrase largely by use of seamless digital technologies has been used in the Digital Lending definition to accord operational flexibility to REs in Digital Lending Therefore even if some physical interface with customer is present the lending will still fall under the definition of Digital Lending However while doing so the REs should ensure that the intent behind the Guidelines is adhered to Q 2 Whether any service provider to whom RE has outsourced some of its credit intermediation activities would fall within the definition of Lending Service Provider LSP even if the lending transaction in question does not fall under the definition of Digital Lending Ans Para 1 of the Annex I to the Circular dated September 02 2022 specifies that these Guidelines are applicable to Digital Lending Hence only if a lending transaction qualifies under the definition of Digital Lending will the service provider facilitating such lending be designated as LSP Q 3 Whether all LSPs need to appoint Grievance Redressal Officers Ans Only those LSPs which have an interface with the borrowers would need to appoint a nodal Grievance Redressal Officer However it may be reiterated that the RE shall remain responsible for ensuring resolution of complaints

Conduct 2022 Such transactions shall not be covered under the Guidelines on Digital Lending However other loan products offered on Credit Cards which are not covered envisaged under the aforesaid para of the Master Direction shall be governed by the stipulations laid down under the Guidelines on Digital Lending Further the Guidelines will also be applicable to all loans offered on Debit Card including EMI programmes Q 5 How to disclose APR in case of floating rate loans Ans In case of floating rate loans APR may be disclosed at the time of origination based on the prevailing rate as per

include insurance charges in the calculation of APR Ans The insurance charges shall be included in the computation of APR only for the insurance which is linkedintegrated in loan products as these charges are intrinsic to the nature of such digital loans Q 7 Whether the flow of funds between the bank accounts of borrower and lender in a lending transaction can be controlled directly or indirectly by a thirdparty including LSP Ans No Q 8 Can the services of Payment Aggregators PA be used for loan disbursals and repayments Ans The principle underlying the Digital Lending Guidelines is that a LSP should not be involved in handling of funds flowing from the lender to the borrower or vice versa While entities offering only PA services shall remain out of the ambit of Guidelines on Digital Lending any PA also performing the role of an LSP must comply with the Digital Lending Guidelines Q 9 In case of delinquent loans recovery servicing of digital loans may be undertaken by a recovery agent collecting cash from borrowers Will such cases be exempted from the requirement of direct repayment of loan in the REs bank account Ans In case of delinquent loans REs can deploy physical interface to recover loans in cash where absolutely necessary In order to afford operational flexibility to REs such transactions are exempted from the requirement of direct repayment of loan in the REs bank account However any recovery by cash should be duly reflected in the borrowers account and REs shall ensure that any fees charges etc payable to LSPs are paid directly by them REs and are not charged by LSP to the borrower directly or indirectly from the recovery proceeds Q 10 In certain cases such as loan products involving advances against salary though the loan is disbursed directly to the bank account of the borrower the repayment is from the corporate employer which deducts the EMI amount from the salary Whether in such cases it still has to be ensured that repayment is directly from the bank account of the borrower Ans Such repayments can be allowed subject to the condition that the loan is repaid by the corporate employer by deducting the amount from the borrowers salary Further REs should ensure that LSPs do not have any control over the flow of funds directly or indirectly in such transactions It has also to be ensured that repayment is directly from the bank account of the employer to the RE Q 11 For colending transactions exemption has been granted from direct disbursal to the bank account of the borrower to the extent of flow of money

15 per cent of public deposits outstanding as on the last working day of the second preceding quarter Of the 15 NBFCs are required to invest not less than ten percent in approved securities and the remaining 5 can be in unencumbered term deposits with any scheduled commercial bank Thus the liquid assets may consist of Government securities Government guaranteed bonds and term deposits with any

dematerialised form with the entities stated above at a place where the registered office of the company is situated However if an NBFC intends to entrust the securities at a place other than the place at which its registered office is located it may do so after obtaining the permission of RBI in writing It may be noted that liquid assets in approved securities will have to be maintained in dematerialised form only The liquid assets maintained as above are to be utilised for payment of claims of depositors However deposits being unsecured in nature depositors do not have direct claim on liquid assets 62 What does RBI do to protect the interest of NBFC depositors RBI has issued detailed regulations on deposit acceptance including the quantum of deposits that can be collected mandatory credit rating mandatory maintenance of liquid assets for repayment to depositors manner of maintenance of its deposit books prudential regulations including maintenance of adequate capital limitations on exposures and inspection of the NBFCs besides others to ensure that the NBFCs function on sound lines If the Bank observes through its inspection or audit of any NBFC or through complaints or through market intelligence that a certain NBFC is not complying with RBI directions it may prohibit the NBFC from accepting further deposits and prohibit it from selling its assets In addition if the depositor has complained to the Company Law Board CLB which has ordered repayment and the NBFC has not complied with the CLB order RBI can initiate prosecution of the NBFC including criminal action and winding up of the company More importantly RBI initiates prompt action including imposing penalties and taking legal action against companies which are found to be violating RBIs instructionsnorms on basis of Market Intelligence reports complaints exception reports from statutory auditors of the companies information received through SLCC meetings etc The Reserve Bank immediately shares such information with all the financial sector regulators and enforcement agencies in the State Level Coordination Committee Meetings As a premier public policy institution as part of its public policy measure the Reserve Bank of India has been in the forefront in taking several initiatives to create awareness among the general public on the need to be careful while investing their hard earned money The initiatives include issue of cautionary notices in print media and distribution of informative and educative brochurespamphlets and close interaction with the public during awarenessoutreach programs Townhall events participation in State Government sponsored trade fairs and exhibitions At times it even requests newspapers with large circulation English and vernacular to desist from accepting advertisements from unincorporated entities seeking deposits 63 Who rates deposit taking NBFCs for acceptance of deposit NBFCs may get itself rated by any of the six rating agencies namely CRISIL CARE ICRA FITCH Ratings India Pvt Ltd Brickwork Ratings India Pvt Ltd and SMERA 64 What are the symbols of minimum investment grade rating of different companies When a companys rating is downgraded does it have to bring down its level of public deposits immediately or over a period of time The symbols of minimum investment grade rating of the Credit rating agencies are It may be added

public deposits report the position within fifteen working days to the RBI and bring within three years from the date of such downgrading of credit rating the amount of public deposit to nil With the introduction of revised regulatory framework in November 2014 deposit taking NBFCs have to mandatorily get investment grade credit rating for being eligible to accept public deposits 65 What is the purpose of enacting Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments Act by the State Governments The purpose of enacting this law is to protect the interests of the depositors The provisions of RBI Act are directed towards enabling RBI to issue prudential regulations that make the financial entities function on sound lines RBI is a civil body and the RBI act is a civil Act Both do not have specific provisions to effect recovery by attachment and sale of assets of the defaulting companies entities or their officials It is the State government machinery which can effectively do this The Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments Acts confers adequate powers on the State Governments to attach and sell assets of the defaulting companies entities and their officials 66 Will the passage of the Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments by the State Governments help in nailing unincorporated entities and companies from unauthorisedly accepting deposits Yes to a large extent The Act makes offences such as unauthorized acceptance of deposits by any entity firm or company a cognizable offence that is entities that are indulging in unauthorized deposit acceptance or unlawful financial activities can be immediately imprisoned and prosecuted Under the Act the State Governments have been given vast powers to attach the property of such entities dispose them off under the orders of special courts and distribute the proceeds to the depositors The widespread State Government State Police machinery is best positioned to take quick action against the culprits The Reserve Bank has therefore been urging all the State Governments to pass the legislation on Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishment Act 67 Still there are cases of unscrupulous financial entities cheating public time and again How does RBI plan to strengthen its surveillance on unauthorized acceptance of depositsunauthorized conduct of NBFI business by companies The Reserve Bank is strengthening its market intelligence function in various Regional Offices and is constantly examining the financials of companies references for which have been received through market intelligence or complaints to the Reserve Bank In this context members of public can contribute a great deal by being vigilant and lodging a complaint immediately if they come across any financial entity that contravenes the RBI Act For example if they are accepting deposits unauthorisedly andconducting NBFC activities without obtaining due permission from the RBI More importantly these entities will not be able to function if members of public start investing wisely Members of the public must know that high returns on investments will also have high risks And there can be no assured return for speculative activities Before investing the public must ensure that the entity they are investing in is a regulated entity with one of the financial sector regulators F Collective Investment Schemes CIS and Chit Funds 68 Are Collective Investment Schemes CIS regulated by the Reserve Bank of India No CIS are schemes where money is exchanged for units be it time share in resorts profit from sale of wood or profits from the developed commercial plots and buildings and so on Collective Investment Schemes CIS do not fall under the regulatory purview of the Reserve Bank 69 Which is the authority that regulates Collective Investment Schemes CIS SEBI is the regulator of CIS Information on such schemes and grievances against the promoters may be immediately forwarded to SEBI as well as to the EOWPolice Department of the State Government 70 Is the conducting of Chit Fund business permissible under law The chit funds are governed by Chit Funds Act 1982 which is a Central Act administered by state governments Those chit funds which are registered under this Act can legally carry on chit fund business 71 If Chit Fund companies are financial entities why are they not regulated by RBI Chit Fund companies are regulated under the Chit Fund Act 1982 which is a Central Act and is implemented by the State Governments RBI has prohibited chit fund companies from accepting deposits from the public in 2009 In case any Chit Fund is accepting public deposits RBI can prosecute such chit funds G Money CirculationMultiLevel Marketing MLM Ponzi Schemes Unincorporated Bodies UIBs 72 There are some companies like MultiLevel Marketing companies Direct Selling Companies Online Selling Companies Do they come under the purview of RBI No MultiLevel Marketing companies Direct Selling Companies Online Selling Companies do not fall under the purview of RBI Activities of these companies fall under the regulatoryadministrative domain of respective state government The list of regulators and the entities regulated by them are as provided in Annex I 73 What are money circulationPonzimultilevel marketing schemes Money circulation multi level marketing Chain Marketing or Ponzi schemes are schemes promising easy or quick money upon enrollment of members Income under Multi level marketing or pyramid structured schemes do not come from the sale of products they offer as much as from enrolling more and more members from whom hefty subscription fees are taken It is incumbent upon all members to enroll more members as a portion of the subscription amounts so collected are distributed among the members at the top of the pyramid Any break in the chain leads to the collapse of the pyramid and the members lower in the pyramid are the ones that are affected the most Ponzi schemes are those schemes that collect money from the public on promises of high returns As there is no asset creation money collected from one depositor is paid as returns to the other Since there is no other activity generating returns the scheme becomes unviable and impossible for the people running the scheme to meet the promised return or even return the principal amounts collected The scheme inevitably fails and the perpetrators disappear with the money 74 Is acceptance of money under Money CirculationMultilevel MarketingPyramid structured schemes allowed Does RBI regulates such schemes No Acceptance of money under Money CirculationMultilevel MarketingPyramid structured schemes and Ponzi schemes is not allowed as acceptance of money under those schemes is a cognizable offence under the Prize Chit and Money Circulation Banning Act 1978 and are hence banned The Reserve Bank has no role in implementation of this Act except advising and assisting the Central Government in framing the Rules under this Act 75 Then who regulates entities that run such schemes Money CirculationMultilevel Marketing Pyramid structured schemes are an offence under the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes Banning Act 1978 The Act prohibits any person or individual to promote or conduct any prize chit or money circulation scheme or enrol as member to its schemes or anyone to participate in it by either receiving or remitting any money in pursuance of such chit or scheme Contravention of the provisions of this Act is monitored and dealt with by the State Governments 76 What if someone operates such a scheme Any informationgrievance relating to such schemes should be given to the police Economic Offence Wing EOW of the concerned State Government or the Ministry of Corporate Affairs If brought to RBI notice we will inform the same to the concerned State Government authorities 77 What are Unincorporated Bodies UIBs Has RBI any role to play in curbing illegal deposit acceptance activities of UIBs Who has the power to take action against Unincorporated Bodies UIBs accepting deposits Unincorporated bodies UIBs include an individual a firm or an unincorporated association of individuals In terms of provision of section 45S of RBI act these entities are prohibited from accepting any deposit The Act makes acceptance of deposits by such UIBs punishable with imprisonment or fine or both The State government has to play a proactive role in arresting the illegal activities of such entities to protect interests of depositorsinvestors UIBs do not come under the regulatory domain of RBI Whenever RBI receives any complaints against UIBs it immediately forwards the same to the state government police agencies Economic Offences Wing EOW The complainants are advised to lodge the complaints directly with the State government police authorities EOW so that appropriate action against the culprits is taken immediately and the process is hastened As per Section 45T of RBI Act both the RBI and State Governments have been given concurrent powers Nonetheless in order to take immediate action against the offender the information should immediately be passed on to the State Police or the Economic Offences Wing of the concerned State who can take prompt and appropriate action Since the State Government machinery is widespread and the State Government is also empowered to take action under the provisions of RBI Act 1934 any information on such entities accepting deposits may be provided immediately to the respective State Governments Police DepartmentEOW Many of the State Governments have enacted the State Protection of Interests of Depositors in Financial Establishments Act which empowers the State Government to take appropriate and timely action RBI on its part has taken various steps to curb activities of UIBs which includes spreading awareness through advertisements in leading newspapers to sensitise public organize various investors awareness programmes in various districts of the country keeps close liaison with the law enforcing agencies Economic Offences Wing 78 There are some entities not companies which carry on activities like that of NBFCs Are they allowed to take deposits Who regulates them Any person who is an individual or a firm or unincorporated association of individuals cannot accept deposits except by way of loan from relatives if hisits business wholly or partly includes loan investment hirepurchase or leasing activity or principal business is that of receiving of deposits under any scheme or arrangement or in any manner or lending in any manner 79 What precautions have to be taken by the public to forewarn themselves about the likelihood of losing money in schemes that offer high rates of interest Before investing in schemes that promise high rates of return investors must ensure that the entity offering such returns is registered with one of the financial sector regulators and is authorized to accept funds whether in the form of deposits or otherwise Investors must generally be circumspect if the interest rates or rates of return on investments offered are high Unless the entity accepting funds is able to earn more than what it promises the entity will not be able to repay the investor as promised For earning higher returns the entity will have to take higher risks on the investments it makes Higher the risk the more speculative are its investments on which there can be no assured return As such the public should forewarn themselves that the likelihood of losing money in schemes that offer high rates of interest are more 80 Who can the DepositorInvestor turn to in case of grievances The two Charts given at Annex I and II depict the activities and the regulators overseeing the same Complaints may hence be addressed to the concerned regulator If the activity is a banned activity the aggrieved person can approach the State PoliceEconomic Offences Wing of the State Police and lodge a suitable complaint 81 What constitutes Commercial Real Estate exposure An exposure to be classified as CRE the essential feature would be that the funding will result in the creation acquisition of real estate such as office buildings to let retail space multifamily residential buildings industrial or warehouse space and hotels where the prospects for repayment would depends primarily on the cash flows generated by the asset Additionally the prospect of recovery in the event of default would also depend primarily on the cash flows generated from such funded asset which is taken as security as would generally be the case The primary source of cash flow ie more than 50 of cash flows for repayment would generally be lease or rental payments or the sale of the assets as also for recovery in the event of default where such asset is taken as security These guidelines will also be applicable to certain cases where the exposure may not be directly linked to the creation or acquisition of CRE but the repayment would come from the cash flows generated by CRE For example exposures taken against existing commercial real estate whose prospects of repayments primarily depend on rental sale proceeds of the real estate should be classified as CRE Other such cases may include extension of guarantees on behalf of companies engaged in commercial real estate activities exposures on account of derivative transactions undertaken with real estate companies corporate loans extended to real estate companies and investment made in the equity and debt instruments of real estate companies Q 82 In terms of para 71 of the revised regulatory framework issued vide CC No 002

Registration from the Bank 5 A single group is having under its fold various prospective Core Investment Companies with an aggregate asset size of more than Rs 100 crore One of the entities has raised holds public funds one of the pre requisites for qualifying as a CICNDSI In such a situation whether every CIC within the group or only the parent CIC or the specific entity that has raised holds

should be relied upon viz certificate from Statutory auditor or audited balance sheet for one year or more Ans Yes CICs presently registered with the Bank but fulfilling the criteria for exemption under Notification No 220 dated January 05 2010 can seek voluntary deregistration Both audited balance sheet and auditors certificate are required to be submitted for the purpose 16 Whether CICs

19 Can CICsCICsNDSI accept deposits Ans No CICs CICsNDSI cannot accept deposits That is one of the eligibility criteria 20 What does the term public funds include Is it the same as public deposits Ans Public funds are not the same as public deposits Public funds include public deposits intercorporate deposits bank finance and all funds received whether directly or indirectly from outside sources such as funds raised by issue of Commercial Papers debentures etc However even though public funds include public deposits in the general course it may be noted that CICsCICsNDSI cannot accept public deposits 21 In the definition of public funds what do the term indirect receipt of public funds mean Ans Indirect receipt of public funds means funds received not directly but through associates and group entities which have access to public funds 22 Can CICs issue guarantees and will this be considered part of definition of public funds Ans Yes CICs may be required to issue guarantees or take on other contingent liabilities on behalf of their group entities Guarantees per se do not fall under the definition of public funds However it is possible that CICs which do not accept public funds take recourse to public funds if and when the guarantee devolves Hence before doing so CICs must ensure that they can meet the obligation there under as and when they arise In particular CICs which are exempt from registration requirement must be in a position to do so without recourse to public funds in the event the liability devolves If unregistered CICs with asset size above Rs 100 crore access public funds without obtaining a Certificate of Registration CoR from RBI they will be seen as violating Core Investment Companies Reserve Bank Directions 2011 dated January 05 2011 23 What is a Group company Ans For the purposes of determining whether a company is a CICCICNDSI companies in the group have been exhaustively defined in para 31 b of Notification No DNBS PD 219CGMUS2011 dated January 5 2011 as an arrangement involving two or more entities related to each other through any of the following relationships vizSubsidiary parent defined in terms of AS 21 Joint venture defined in terms of AS 27 Associate defined in terms of AS 23 Promoterpromotee as provided in the SEBI Acquisition of Shares and Takeover Regulations 1997 for listed companies a related party defined in terms of AS 18 Common brand name and investment in equity shares of 20 and above 24 How can a company register as a CICNDSI Ans The application form for CICsNDSI available on the Banks website can be downloaded and filled in and submitted to the Regional Office of the DNBS in whose jurisdiction the Company is registered along with necessary supporting documents mentioned in the application form 25 A CICNDSI should have 90 investment within the group and in terms of current exposure norms NBFCsNDSI are permitted only 40 of both lending and investment within any group Therefore no NBFC as it stands would be able to become a CIC without breaching the NOF CRAR or Concentration Norms since its entire business is in a subsidiary However an NBFC may voluntarily seek to become a CICNDSI since it brings clarity to the holding structure in their organization How would this issue be resolved Could NBFCsNDSI be provided exemption from Capital adequacyexposure norms during the transition period just as unregistered CICsNDSI are given 6 months time Ans The NBFC would have to apply to RBI with full details of the plan and exemptions could be considered on a selective basis on the merits of the case 26 A company has investments in Group companies but does not meet the criteria of principal business as defined in terms of assetincome criteria to be as an NBFC Can the company still be registered as a CIC or does it need to first register as an NBFC Ans CICs need not meet the principal business criteria for NBFCs 27 If a company is a CIC but does not exactly meet the criteria specified does the company need to register as an NBFC Ans A holding company not meeting the criteria for a CIC laid down in para 2 of Notification No DNBS PD 219CGMUS2011 dated January 5 2011 would require to register as an NBFC However if such company wishes to register as CICNDSI be exempted as CIC it would have to apply to RBI with an action plan achievable within the specific period to reorganize its business as CIC If it is not able to do so it would need to comply with NBFC requirements and prudential norms 28 Whether a Holding Company which is not able to comply with the CIC criteria all four conditions would still need to comply with NBFC requirements and prudential norms even in the event that it is not satisfying the assetincome criteria For example the holding company owns 60 per cent equity in another group company and is not meeting other three conditions Therefore it does not qualify as a CIC Further the income from financial assets is also less than 50 per cent of total income Whether such a company would require compliance with NBFC norms Ans No since the Company is not fulfilling the Principal Business Criteria assetincome pattern of an NBFC ie more than 50 of its total assets should be financial assets and the income derived from these assets should be more than 50 of the gross income it is not required to register as an NBFC under Section 45 IA of the RBI Act 1934 However it should register itself as an NBFC as soon as it fulfills the criteria of an NBFC and comply with the NBFC norms 29 A group would like to set up a CICNDSI in the group to rationalize the set up However no company can commence the business of NBFI without COR from RBI Therefore the proposed company would have to apply for COR before transferring shares from different companies to the CICNDSI But at that time the company would not be eligible in terms of the requirements as it would not have 90 of net assets as investment in group companies What should the company do Ans The company would have to apply for COR to RBI giving a business plan within a prescribed time period of one year in which it would achieve CICNDSI status In case the company is unable to do so the exemptions would not apply and the company would have to comply with NBFC capital adequacy and exposure norms 30 Whether CICs that are exempt from registration either because they have an asset size of less than Rs 100 crore or are not accessing public funds are required to register as NBFCs Ans CICs that a have an asset size of less than Rs100 crore irrespective of whether they are accessing public funds or not and b have an asset size of Rs 100 crore and above and are not accessing public funds have been exempt from registration with the Bank under Section 45IA of the RBI Act 1934 in terms of notification No DNBSPD221CGMUS 2011 dated January 5 2011 Thus they are not required to register with the Bank at all As this is an exemption given under Section 45NC of the RBI Act 1934 they are not required to approach the Bank at all 31 Would a similar benefit apply to NBFCs ie would NBFCs with an asset size of less than Rs 100 crore and not accessing public funds be exempted from registration with the Bank Ans No this exemption is specifically given to CICs only NBFCs other than CICs are not covered by this or any other aspect of the CIC Directions and would have to register with the Bank and comply with all applicable Directions of the Bank as issued from time to time 32 Should Net assets include operating assets Ans Net assets have been defined in Notification No DNBSPD 219CGMUS2011 dated January 05 2011 para31e specifically for the purpose of defining a CIC As such they will only include the items specifically mentioned therein irrespective of whether any of these qualify as operating assets or not 33 Definition of Group Companies should include LLPs and Partnerships in the Group Ans Neither LLPs nor Partnerships are companies and hence have been deliberately excluded from the definition of Group Company Further in view of the loose structure and regulatory framework for these entities it is felt that they should not be included in the definition 34 While instruments that are compulsorily convertible into equity shares within a period not exceeding 10 years from the date of issue are excluded from Outside Liabilities in terms of the Companies Act such instruments are excluded from the definition of public deposit if they are convertible with a period of 20 years Ans The period of 10 years was specified as a prudential measure not necessarily in alignment with a provision of the Companies Act Moreover the issue here is not public deposits but Outside Liabilities 35 Unlike other NBFCs can CICs NDSI a no longer make overseas investment or b raise ECB or c obtain bank finance for acquisition of shares Ans The Directions on CICNDSIs have not restricted them from making overseas investment Such investment will be governed by the provisions of Chapter VII of Master DirectionCore Investment Companies Reserve Bank Directions 2016 Similarly presently CICNDSIs can raise funds through ECB The same would be governed by the instructions contained in the ECB Policy issued by Foreign Exchange Department of the Reserve Bank Lending to NBFCs CICs by banks will be governed by the provisions as applicable to banks and specifically contained in the instructions on bank finance to NBFCs issued by Department of Banking Regulation of the Reserve Bank 36 If one of the small CICs in a group does not access public funds why should it register based on the condition of aggregate asset size Ans As already clarified in the FAQs a CIC that does not access public funds is exempt from registration irrespective of having other CICs in the Group that access public funds Illustratively if A is a CIC and B and C are also CICs and Group Companies of A provided A does not access any form of public funds including any funds from any Group Company including B and C it would not require to register as a CIC If A B and C do not access public funds in any form none of them would be required to register as a CIC 37 Will adjusted net worth of all the CICs in the Group also be aggregated for compliance purposes Ans Adjusted net worth ANW is a concept akin to capital requirement wherein the ANW should not be less than 30 of the risk weighted assets RWA In cases where asset size is aggregated all the CICs within the group will be registered as CICNDSI ANW will be applicable individually 38 There is an apparent anomaly in the definition of public funds as the moment public deposits is included in the definition of public funds and CICs will be deemed to have raised public deposits and will therefore become an NBFC subject to exposure norms Ans Even though public funds include public deposits in the general course it may be noted that CICs cannot accept public deposits It may further be reiterated that no NBFC can accept public deposits without specific permission of the Bank even if it holds a CoR from the Bank 39 Would para 7 of the revised regulatory framework for NBFCs issued vide CC DNBR PD CCNo 0020310001 201415 dated November 10 2014 on multiple NBFCs in a group also apply to Core Investment Companies CICs in the group Ans No CICs in a group would not be considered for aggregating the assets of multiple NBFCs in a group under the circular Instructions contained in the Core Investment Companies Reserve Bank Directions 2011 dated January 5 2011 shall be applicable to CICs in this regard 40

NBFCs with assets Rs 500 crore as specified in the Systemically Important NonBanking Financial NonDeposit accepting or holding Companies Prudential Norms Reserve Bank Directions 2015 41 What are the standard asset provisioning norms applicable to CICs Ans Registered CICs with assets Rs 500 crore shall maintain standard asset provisioning of 025 as specified in the NonSystemically Important NonBanking Financial NonDeposit accepting or holding Companies Prudential Norms Reserve Bank Directions 2015 and those with assets Rs500 crore shall maintain standard asset provisioning of 040 which

Companies CICs permitted to invest in Liquid Fund Schemes Mutual Funds with maturity of less than 91 days Ans Yes As per the present directions for CICs they are permitted to make investments in money market instruments including money market mutual funds Since Liquid Funds are also mutual funds with the underlying being money market instruments CICs are permitted to invest their surplus funds in Liquid Fund Schemes also 43 CICs which presently have an asset size of less than Rs 100 crore are required to apply to the Bank within three months of the date of achieving a balance sheet size of Rs

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_PressRelease.aspx?prid=56750&fn=2759,Date RBI Bulletin November 2023,The Reserve Bank has a rich tradition of generating accurate and timely data policyoriented and topical economic research publication of statutory and other themebased reports and knowledgesharing Today the Reserve Bank released the November 2023 issue of its monthly Bulletin The Bulletin includes five speeches four articles and current statistics The four articles are I State of the Economy II Reading the Markets Mind Decoding Monetary Policy Expectations from Financial Data III Transitioning Indias Power Sector Repurposing of CoalFired Power Plants IV Monetary Policy Transmission in India Recent Dynamics I State of the Economy The global economy shows signs of slowing down in the final quarter of 2023 as manufacturing languishes while services sector activity appears to have reached the end of its postpandemic expansion Going forward tightening financial conditions is a significant risk to the global outlook In India the momentum of the change in GDP is sequentially expected to be higher in Q3202324 with festival demand remaining ebullient Investment demand appears to be resilient with the governments infrastructure spending an uptick in private capex automation digitalisation and indigenisation providing a boost Headline inflation came down to 49 per cent in October from the average of 67 per cent in 202223 and 71 per cent in JulyAugust 2023 II Reading the Markets Mind Decoding Monetary Policy Expectations from Financial Data By Joice John Bhimappa A Talwar Priyanka Sachdeva and Indranil Bhattacharyya This article uses the Overnight Index Swaps OIS rate to decode the nearterm market expectations of changes in the monetary policy rate during 2016 to 2023 Further this article also analyses the impact of anticipated and unanticipated changes in the policy rate on interest rates across market segments and maturities Highlights During 20162023 unanticipated changes in policy rate or monetary policy surprises have been rare suggesting that the RBIs communication has been effective in guiding market expectations The anticipated changes in policy rate are found to have no immediate impact on longer term interest rates as those were already factored in by the markets In contrast the few instances of monetary policy surprises had an instantaneous impact across market segments and maturities on the day of the policy announcement III Transitioning Indias Power Sector Repurposing of CoalFired Power Plants By Brij Raj and Amit Kumar As India navigates the dual challenge of balancing its growing energy demands with environmental sustainability this article explores the potential risks associated with stranded assets in the coal and fossil fuel sectors as well as their probable impact on banks and financial institutions FIs that have exposure to these sectors Highlights Globally there is an observable trend of tightening financing conditions for coal projects reflecting a heightened awareness of risks associated with the energy transition Repurposing coalfired power plants is a complex endeavor but emerging climate finance tools like coal transition mechanisms can expedite the shift towards cleaner energy despite being in a nascent stage Banks and FIs can contribute to the decarbonization of the power sector by improving their Environmental Social and Governance ESG practices and providing transition financing to help producers meet environmental and emission norms A balanced approach is recommended for a smooth transition from coal and fossil fuel financing considering Indias developmental requirements IV Monetary Policy Transmission in India Recent Dynamics By Yuvraj Kashyap Avnish Kumar Anand Prakash and Shubhangi Latey Against the backdrop of the shift in the monetary policy cycle this article reviews recent monetary policy transmission dynamics in India It estimates the degree of passthrough to lending and deposit rates and attempts to delineate the potential determinants of the passthrough Highlights The external benchmarkbased lending rate EBLR system of loan pricing calibrated normalisation of surplus liquidity and robust credit growth strengthened transmission during the current tightening phase although it is still not complete The transmission to term deposit rates has been strong while savings deposit rates have remained largely unchanged Therefore the pace of increase in deposit rates term deposits and savings account deposits taken together has lagged the pace of increase in lending rates in the current tightening cycle which is reflected in an improvement in NIMs of banks during 202223 An empirical banklevel analysis in a panel framework indicates that surplus liquidity in the banking system and a higher share of CASA deposits in total deposits has a softening impact on lending rates The passthrough to lending rates is found to be higher during the tightening cycle High creditdeposit CD ratio raises deposit and lending rates Surplus liquidity and excess SLR lower the passthrough to deposit rates The views expressed in the Bulletin articles are of the authors and do not represent the views of the Reserve Bank of India Yogesh Dayal Chief General Manager Press Release 202320241300

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1394&fn=2759,Date Towards A Greener Cleaner India Inaugural Address by Dr Michael Debabrata Patra Deputy Governor RBI at the New York Fed Central Banking Seminar organised by the Federal Reserve Bank New York on October 9 2023 at New York,The Reserve Bank has a rich tradition of generating accurate and timely data policyoriented and topical economic research publication of statutory and other themebased reports and knowledgesharing Good Morning to you all I am delighted to be here again at the prestigious Annual Central Banking Seminar a flagship event of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for which it has earned global renown It is truly an honour to interact with central bankers from around the world our community of tomorrow You embody the theme of Indias G20 Presidency Vasudhaivya Kutumbakam the world is one family The Climate is Striking Back In my past interactions in this Seminar I have dwelled on macroeconomic stability price stability exchange rate stability financial stability all essentially issues centered around the core competence of conservative central bankers from which we are reluctant to stray After all central banks stand for stability Today however I will venture to address a theme which threatens to overwhelm all these aspects of stability the sum of all fears to borrow the name of a gripping 2002 movie starring Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman It is a theme about which several central banks have expressed reservations about engaging in order to avoid mission creep while others have expressed inability in view of lacking the instruments to deal with it The stark ominous reality is that the climate is striking back Central banks cannot be immune or inactive any longer Climate change is not new The earths climate has changed in the past and quite drastically The Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History has released findings about the earths temperature over the last 500 million years2 They show warm temperatures dominating most of the time with global temperatures repeatedly rising above 266 degree Celsius C and even above 32C much too warm for ice sheets or perennial sea ice In fact polar caps cannot exist when the temperature crosses 18C This is the fever line About 250 million years ago it was too hot for even swamps to exist In the last 100 million years global temperatures have peaked twice In fact during much of the Paleocene3 and early Eocene4 epochs 5556 million years ago the poles were free of ice caps and palm trees and crocodiles lived above the Arctic Circle About 60 million years ago the earths climate changed dramatically due to the devastating impact of a large asteroid colliding with the earth leading to the extinction of dinosaurs However one dinosaur survived the theropod group which included Trex It evolved into the birds that rule earths skies today Modern human civilisation which has developed over just the past 10000 years or so has seen a period of low temperatures and relative global climate stability Compared to most of the earths history this period has been cold at 148C known as the interglacial period5 The earths temperature has begun rising In September 2023 it averaged 164C degrees Celsius 175 degrees warmer than the preindustrial period of 18501900 World Meteorological Organisation WMO October 20236 The warming up of the climate can have cataclysmic consequences Climate Catastrophes Paralysing Earth Climate change is manifesting itself at an alarming scale and pace globally undermining livelihoods infrastructure and endangering health food energy and water security Humanity is imperilled and so is the future of the planet According to the World Meteorological Organisation WMO the period 201522 has been the warmest on record In the Northern hemisphere this years summer has been the hottest on record and the year 2023 is on its way to becoming the hottest ever7 Climatic disasters are occurring more frequently and across the globe The world recorded its warmest September on record in 2023 In the European Alps glacier melt records were broken in 2022 Switzerland lost about 6 per cent of its glacier ice volume For the first time in history there was no accumulation of fresh ice even at the very highest measurement sites according to the WMO Sea levels increased by about 5 millimetres during January 2021 August 2022 due to increasing ice melt During 2022 58 per cent of the ocean surface experienced at least one marine heat wave There was a drop in the Antarctic Sea ice extent to 192 million km2 which was the lowest level on record and was almost 1 million km2 below the longterm average This has been associated with increasing global surface temperatures droughts storms dangerous floods and heat waves of increased intensity and frequency around the world India faced its hottest February in 2023 since recordkeeping began in 19018 In March large parts of the country experienced hailstorms and torrents of unseasonal rain leading to extensive damage to standing crops According to Indias Centre for Science and Environment CSE the country experienced extreme weather events on 314 of 365 days of 2022 which claimed 3026 lives affected 196 million hectares of crop area and 423249 houses and killed over 69899 animals9 In 2023 April witnessed a recordbreaking heat wave in India and other parts of Asia May was the warmest since 1850 June and July were the hottest on record and August was the driest for India since 190110 In sharp contrast to the world India experienced among its wettest Septembers in 2023 This Time is Different Although temperature increases have been recorded during the course of earths history as I mentioned earlier the current episode of anthropogenic climate change is qualitatively different from the historical experience First changes in the earths climate that are underway are largely humaninduced as noted earlier while the earlier incidences were primarily the result of various natural factors Second the pace of climate change during the current phase is remarkably rapid it is unfolding over decades whereas earlier occurrences of climate change happened over centuries and millennia Third costs involved in the policy responses for adaptation to and mitigation of climate change related challenges are unprecedented Fourth the current experience with climate change is truly global in nature with accentuated regional implications Climate scientists recognise three anthropogenic or humaninduced drivers of climate change green house gas GHG emissions aerosols and land use and land cover Estimates show that the contribution of humancaused global surface temperature increase is 107C during 20102019 relative to 18501900 levels almost the entire increase in global temperature during this period11 The rise in extreme weather events has also increased the economic costs associated with such events Measuring Climate Change In order to comprehend what is going on and respond effectively it is important to first measure the phenomenon of climate change Climate scientists use many physical indicators including atmospheric oceanic and cryospheric to assess climate change only some of which I shall elaborate on in the interest of time Global mean surface temperature the average of land surface temperature LST and sea surface temperature SST apart from the secular rise in LST more than 90 per cent of the net energy or heat increase in the climate system is stored in oceans and over 60 per cent in the upper ocean 0700 metres In fact the heat absorbed in the upper layer of the ocean has increased causing thermal expansion melting of glaciers and ice caps rise in sea level and ocean acidification Each decade is becoming warmer than the previous one by around 02C since the 1980s The rise in surface temperatures is increasing evaporation which in turn is causing more overall precipitation and more frequent and more intense storms and floods On account of the unequal pattern of precipitation wet areas are getting wetter while dry land is becoming drier Uncertain rainfall patterns have increased the frequency of droughts and floods Unlike land or water surface ice reflects almost all the solar energy that falls on it When snow or ice melts in response to a rise in temperature it exposes open water or land surface that absorbs solar energy and raises temperature further in the atmosphere Furthermore the melting of glaciers and ice adds to sea level expansion Moreover snow and ice are potential sources of fresh water supply required for ecosystems agriculture recreation and livelihoods Losses of snow cover glaciers ice sheets and sea ice lead to increases in absorbed solar radiation and this in turn causes further warming as well as turbulent heat fluxes at the surface The cumulative glacier mass loss since the beginning of 1970 is more than 25 meters of water equivalent mwe The strong increase in ice glacier decline rates in each decade until the present day leaves no doubt about ongoing climate change While each indicator has its own relevance in explaining climate change the totality of what we face warrants a composite indicator that has been developed by using 11 key physical indicators12 in a dynamic factor model DFM framework The DFM extracts an unobserved or latent common factor from these indicators We call it the global climate change index or GCCI It shows an upward trend since the late 19th century following the Industrial Revolution The correlation between the GCCI and the total number of extreme weather events is 09 indicating a rise in the frequency of disaster events with climate change With the current state of climate policy action emissions an average of 38 giga tons of carbon dioxide equivalent will result in a rise in global temperature by 27C over the preindustrial average by 2100 Even if all pledges and targets announced so far are incorporated associated with an average 102 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent the global rise in temperature can reach a minimum of 19C above preindustrial levels under the most optimistic path of global emission reduction In order to achieve net zero by 2070 and the global temperature increase of 15 degrees Celsius emissions have to be reduced much lower Climate Change Global Actions Climate change has moved to the centre stage of the global public policy debate today While the growing recognition of the adverse effects of climate change has led to some recent actions that are weakening the correlation between carbon emissions and GDP growth globally an absolute decoupling is yet to happen Climate change can affect price stability through supply shocks such as food and energy shortages and through a decline in productive capacity Demand shocks can arise due to the loss of wealth of firms and households on account of frequent natural disasters Physical and transition risks can affect the balance sheets of financial institutions and banks limiting the flow of credit to the real economy These destructive forces interact with each other to form vicious feedback loops Hence almost all countries have committed to timelines for the transition to net zero emissions with the majority committing to achieve this target by 2050 While 23 per cent of the countries have made the target a legal obligation 18 per cent have proposed to make it into a legal obligation and the remaining 59 per cent have made their pledges in official policy documents All these countries together account for around 73 per cent of global CO2 emissions 59 countries have proposed actions or are in discussions Climate Change and India The Indian subcontinent has a diverse topography ranging from the snowclad Himalayas in the north the youngest and tallest mountains in the world fertile plains the worlds largest delta in the east the Thar desert in the northwest and a long coastline of more than 7500 kilometres Consequently the country is intrinsically exposed to different temperature and precipitation patterns More recently however India is becoming vulnerable to extreme weather events Coastal cities which are among the most densely populated regions of the world are becoming increasingly prone to cyclones flooding and salinisation of farmlands and freshwater supplies The Indian subcontinent receives about 75 per cent of its annual rainfall during the southwest monsoon SWM season from June to September This rainfall is crucial for the summer cropping season Over time the southwest monsoon SWM pattern has subtly changed with a rise in average annual rainfall At the same time dry periods have become more common while intense wet spells have also increased Overall risks to agricultural production and food price volatility have both increased significantly The past decade 20112021 has been the warmest on record with 11 of the 15 hottest years in India since 1901 the years 2022 and 2021 are ranked as the fifth and sixth warmest years respectively since 1901India Meteorological Department Extreme weather events including unseasonal rainfall cyclones and heatwaves have become more frequent Indias Energy Requirements The sectoral composition of Indias GDP is skewed towards services 60 per cent which is emissionlight with a relatively lower energy intensity of output a natural lid on emissions Although emissions from the industrial sector 16 per cent are higher the emission intensity of agriculture which involves both energy related emissions and nonenergy related emissions is in fact higher than certain industries such as textiles machinery and equipment as well as construction activity Energy production drives around threequarters of global GHG emissions In terms of the overall energymix fossil fuelbased energy sources viz coal oil and natural gas continue to dominate energy consumption in India The share of coal in Indias electricity production is around 70 per cent World Energy Outlook 2021 The War against Emissions The energy intensity of the economy is being reduced by moving from fossil to nonfossil fuels adopting energy efficiency measures employing new and improved technologies and increasing productivity The International Energy Agency IEA states that Indias energy intensity of GDP has been declining at an average rate of 3 per cent per year during the last three decades to 025 tonnes of CO2 per 1000 US dollars in 2021 indicating relative decoupling since the 1991 peak The Climate Change Performance Index CCPI published annually since 2005 by German Watch a nonprofit nongovernmental organisation that lobbies for sustainable development is an independent monitoring tool for tracking countries climate protection performance It increases transparency in national and international climate policy and enables comparison of individual countries climate protection efforts and progress India is among the high performing countries in the index India earns a high rating in the GHG emissions and energy use categories with a medium rating for climate policy and renewable energy The country is on track to meet its 2030 emissions targets compatible with a wellbelow 2C scenario Since the last CCPI India has updated its Nationally Determined Contributions NDCs and announced a net zero target for 2070 Green Initiatives in India By July 2023 renewable energy including hydro installed capacity stood at 177 giga watts GW accounting for 42 per cent of total installed capacity but renewable energy accounts for only 272 per cent of total generation Indias clean energy target is 500 GW by 2030 Capacity under construction is around 80 GW taking the total available capacity to about 250 GW The required capacity addition is another 250 GW by 2030India needs to add 25 GW of renewable energy capacity annually for the next eight years which would involve an investment of US 15 to 16 billion 125000 crore This implies that renewable energy including hydro installed capacity should increase at a rate of 164 per cent Globally the sales of electric vehicles EVs have crossed the 10 million mark in 2022 with a yearonyear yoy growth of 55 per cent The share of EVs in total new sales is rising rapidly in India and sales have crossed 1 million in 2022 Estimated GHG Emissions Under Alternative Growth Scenarios Emerging market and developing countries including India face a tradeoff they must continue to prioritise growth aspirations while pursuing climate related nationally determined goals Scenarios have been developed on Indias roadmap to net zero by 2070 conditional on different assumptions for real GDP growth the share of green energy in total energy demand and energy intensity of GDP In the baseline scenario the Indian economy grows at the rate of 66 per cent per year which is its average growth rate over the last decade but without taking actions to fulfil its environmental commitments A decline in energy usage per unit of economic activity by 23 per cent annually is assumed with steady carbon sequestration at 03 gigatonnes This scenario is associated with increasing emissions An alternate scenario retains the GDP growth assumption of 66 per cent per year It focuses on meeting immediate NDC objectives like reducing emission intensity and raising renewable energys share to 50 per cent in electricity generation by 2030 Achieving net zero emissions by 2070 would require even more energy efficiency with energy intensity declining to 50 per cent by 2070 Green energys share should reach 70 per cent by 2070 Under this scenario greenhouse gas emissions peak by 203233 and India reaches net zero by 2070 Energy consumption in 2070 is projected to be 18 times the level of 202122 compared to 72 times in the baseline scenario but it will be difficult to maintain the longterm growth rate of 66 per cent A second alternate scenario assumes that India would achieve annual real GDP growth of 96 per cent between 202324 to 204748 which is required for it to become an advanced economy by 2047 With respect to climate goals however the assumptions in this scenario are the same as in the baseline Higher growth would translate into even higher energy requirements and emissions The total primary energy requirement and net GHG emissions are estimated to be 125 times and 105 times higher respectively than their levels in 202122 The best scenario assuming a GDP growth of 96 per cent per annum over the period 202348 while adhering to the NDC commitments will require more aggressive efforts than the current NDC targets involving sharper declines in energy intensity and a higher proportion of green energy Energy intensity which has been steadily declining since the 1990s needs to decrease by 54 per cent annually and green energys share must rise to around 82 per cent by 2070 Energy consumption in 2070 would be 31 times higher than in 202122 Indias aspiration to become an advanced economy by 2047 would need to take into account these considerations India COP 26 and 27 In 2021 at COP26 India presented Panchamrit of Indias climate action Reach 500 GW nonfossil energy capacity by 2030 50 per cent of its energy requirements from renewable energy by 2030 Reduction of total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes from now to 2030 Reduction of the carbon intensity of the economy by 45 per cent by 2030 over 2005 levels Achieving the target of net zero emissions by 2070 India participated in COP27 in 2022 at Sharm El Sheikh Egypt with a focus on mainstreaming the theme of LiFE Lifestyle for Environment It highlighted the theme of LiFE everyone can contribute within ones capacity Green Initiatives by the RBI There is a growing recognition that even if governments are the most influential agency for climate change central banks and financial sector regulatorssupervisors are going to become the major stakeholders because 1 financial institutions play a key role in intermediation and hence have a more direct role in addressing climate change and 2 climate change is impacting the achievement of their mandates of price and financial stability In December 2007 the Reserve Bank mandated Corporate Social Responsibility Sustainable Development and Nonfinancial Reporting Role of Banks highlighting the importance of global warming and climate change in the context of sustainable development In 2015 loans for generation of renewable energy and public utilities run on nonconventional energy were made part of directed priority sector lending by banks In April 2021 the RBI joined the Network for Greening the Financial System NGFS to benefit from and contribute to the best practices in climate risk management and green finance In January 2022 the RBI conducted a Survey on Climate Risk and Sustainable Finance to assess the status of climate risk and sustainable finance in leading scheduled commercial banks In JanuaryFebruary 2023 the RBI issued sovereign green bonds worth US 22 billion 16000 crore in two tranches to mobilise resources for the Government for green infrastructural investments In April 2023 the RBI introduced a Framework for Acceptance of Green Deposits from June 01 2023 Conclusion Central banks generally pursue a relatively narrow mandate focused on stability Climate change is certainly not a part of it At least till now Yet as more evidence accumulates that climate change is overwhelming the earth due to human activity we cannot remain silent spectators So in the RBI we began from scratch and immersed ourselves in the economics of climate change Uncharacteristically we pooled all that we could gather on the climate and put it into our flagship publication The Report on Currency and Finance This is our small contribution towards a greener cleaner India To conclude climate change threatens to overwhelm the earth but we can reverse it because we have induced it The time to act is now on several fronts Development and climate change are not necessarily pitted in a trade off sustainable development is key The climate is a global public good global action is needed for humanity to live in harmony with our planet And it is in our hands Thank you 1 Inaugural Address delivered by Michael

policyoriented and topical economic research publication of statutory and other themebased reports and knowledgesharing Namaskar and Good Afternoon Our eminent chief guest Professor S R S Varadhan Frank Jay Gould Professor of Science New York University and recipient of the Padma Vibhushan Professor Rajeeva L Karandikar Chairman National Statistical Commission we eagerly await his keynote address Professor G Sivakumar Professor Computer Science Indian Institute of Technology Bombay whose guidance has been illuminating the voyage of CIMS from an idea to reality distinguished members of the Technical Advisory Group who have provided wise counsel all the way honoured guests of the Reserve Bank of India RBI my colleagues from the Department of Statistic and Information Management DSIM colleagues from various departments of the RBI ladies and gentlemen More than a decade and a half ago the birthday of Professor Mahalonobis was chosen as Statistics Day in India My illustrious predecessor former Deputy Governor Dr Rakesh Mohan who mentored me and who I always look up to remarked on the occasion of the first Statistics Day celebration in 2007 As a member of the statistics community it is a matter of great pride that June 29 the birth anniversary of late Professor Prashanta Chandra Mahalonobis has been declared by the Government of India as Statistics Day Significantly India started celebrating Statistics Day even before the UN General Assembly designated October 20 as World Statistics Day in 2010 to be celebrated every five years on that day With our DSIMs deep bonds with the Indian Statistical Institute ISI founded by Professor Mahalonobis and with several ISI alumni taking up statistics as a professional career in the department the RBI was among the earliest institutions to celebrate his legacy right up to the 17th commemoration by the RBI of his birth anniversary that elapsed yesterday For us it is a time to look back at the light shone by Professor Mahalanobis and look forward to relive his vision It is also a time for taking stock of the road travelled so far and to explore new frontiers of statistical enquiry Our deliberations today commencing with the insighful memorial lecture to which we were just treated the extremely topical and relevant keynote address to which we are looking forward and the thematic papers around the theme of Indias G20 Presidency all imbibe the essence of this journey Several of us present here have not been as rigorously nurtured in the statistical temper as others who have been more fortunate but statistics touches and moulds every aspect of our lives in fundamental ways Accordingly instead of the foolhardy audacity of trying to talk statistics to statisticians I thought I would use this opportunity to share a users perceptions on how statistics informs and empowers the conduct and implementation of monetary policy in India In this area of our work we are forced more often than not to fly blind yet always mindful of the fact that policy errors can be costly and welfare diminishing for our society In this mountain of dark uncertainty statistics provide a foothold by visualising causal relationships or the absence of them simulating plausible scenarios peering into the crystal ball at the future with forecasts feeling the pulse of households and businesses and communicating our assessment to the rest of the world so as to build common expectations all chiselled with precision and confidence This is the subject of my address today the key role of statistics in making monetary policy work The Context After all the various processes that lead up to the monetary policy decision have been completed the choice of policy action is ultimately a tradeoff between the desirable and the feasible2 It is always formulated under conditions of high uncertainty and eventually rests on a judgment call based on information experience and a feel or a sniff of how the state of the economy is likely to evolve over the future Illustratively information on monetary policys goal variables growth and inflation at the time of taking the policy decision is lagged and preliminary at any given point in time the number available on the growth of the economy is at least three months old while data on inflation are at least one month old and subject to revisions but the policy decision is not Moreover these variables move with time and their paths are unknown Achieving these goals always involves making the best possible guess of their likely course even as the economy is constantly being bombarded by meteorites in the form of supply shocks Also as is well known monetary policy itself works its way into the economy through long and variable lags an increase in the policy rate today does not deliver disinflation tomorrow Uncertainty also shrouds the deep parameters that monetary policy has to wield in order to achieve its goals In a new Keynesian world for instance a vital parameter is the sensitivity of aggregate demand to the real interest rate Precision in the knowledge about it is crucial to calibrate the size and timing of monetary policy actions too little may be futile not much may be overkill Even ahead of this decision point the monetary policymaker is conscious that while the policy action is imparted at the shortest end of the market continuum it is done so with the conviction that the policy impulse will be transmitted through other market segments and the structure of interest rates to the longer term interest rates that affect aggregate demand and hence output and inflation The reality is that much is lost in the transmission itself a subject of another speech which I commend for your reference3 Another key parameter is the responsiveness of aggregate supply to prices or costs the slope of the celebrated Phillips curve Is there some low level of inflation that greases the wheels of production and conversely is there some high level of inflation that is inimically harmful for output A good fix on it is essential to determine the growthinflation tradeoff the sacrifice of output that has to be made for every unit of disinflation or the gains in output that can be secured without pushing inflation beyond the limits of tolerance The policy rule typically formulated with feedback in the form of a reaction function involves searching issues as well Is the Taylor principle that the policy rate changes more than proportionately visvis the change in inflation satisfied Where is the larger weight to be assigned to aligning inflation with the target or to stabilising output around its trend and when How much interest rate smoothing or baby steps should the central bank engage in so as to avoid unpleasant monetary surprises Or should it adopt the cold turkey approach of large and sudden policy moves to ensure that its actions are credible and goalfocused In this sense the formulation of monetary policy has been likened to gazing at a radar screen or a distant early warning DEW line scouring it for friendly or enemy formations in the information that is available As soon as a formation is detected monetary policy authorities must be ready to shoot forward and preemptively while judging the trajectory of the goal variables The RBIs Full Information Approach Against this backdrop the first stage of the monetary policy process involves assimilating and parsing every information that is available on the health and functioning of the economy and the external environment in which it operates In this regard the DSIM specialises in two critical areas corporate finances and external sector statistics In fact our statisticians have a long and hallowed history in both fields with databases and analytics dating back to the 1940s They also contribute directly to the national statistical system in these areas while matching the worlds best practices India is compliant with the International Monetary Funds Special Data Dissemination Standards SDDS which guide members in the provision of timely and comprehensive economic and financial statistics to the public In turn these data disseminations contribute to sound macroeconomic policies and improved functioning of financial markets In the case of external sector statistics the formal compilation of which goes back to 1948 India has developed among the most sophisticated databases in the world Yet the operational reality in India is that balance of payments statistics are essentially a biproduct of exchange control The intrepid statistician compiling them has to acquire domain knowledge in the conduct of foreign exchange management the functioning of forex markets and the husbanding of official foreign exchange reserves in order to meet the exacting standards of data dissemination From the point of view of monetary policy these statistics assume vital importance in assessing the contribution of net exports to GDP the imported component of inflation capital flows as a supplement to domestic saving to meet desired investment rates and the net international investment position of the economy Although monetary policy has an exclusive domestic orientation it is framed in a dynamic international environment replete with spillovers and spillbacks It is in this context that external sector statistics serve as a beacon of light showing monetary policy makers the way forward in navigating formidable global tides In the area of corporate finances the RBIs data fill important information gaps For long the RBI has been a source of independent evaluation of corporate savings and investment which serves as a useful crosscheck to the estimations of the National Statistical Office NSO The database is specifically designed to yield information critical to monetary policy formulation such as assessments of domestic demand input cost pressures pricing power and the contribution of corporate profitability to gross value added in the economy Mapping the sources and uses of funds in the corporate sector helps the monetary policymaker to evaluate the economys position in the capex cycle Areas of corporate vulnerability like leverage and debt servicing capacity are also tracked as they guide the setting of riskminimising monetary policy Understanding and analysing external and corporate finances are important inputs in the monetary policy processes because they convey key information on the working of the economy They are however backwardlooking in that they tell us about developments up to the most recent past For meeting the requirement of setting forwardlooking monetary policy we need forwardlooking information to which I now turn Surveys Empower Forwardlooking Monetary Policy A popular expression of the stance of monetary policy in uncertain times is being datadependent or relying on incoming data4 As explained earlier however monetary policy has to aim forward because of the lags in its operation and the fact that its goal variables are time and space contingent Even forecasts based on incoming data are backwardlooking by definition since they draw from information about the past The RBI bridges this gap through its forwardlooking surveys of households and businesses Messages therefrom shape the policy reaction function Incorporating surveybased information is consistent with the received wisdom on the role of expectations in fashioning monetary policy Economic agents such as consumers and firms are believed to be rational in that they use all available information in making their decisions within their budget constraints with a view on the future This tendency is fully utilised by efficient markets in pricing financial assets in such a way that forward rates of interest implicit in the yield curve provide unbiased estimates of the markets expectations of future spot rates By putting a finger on the pulse of households and businesses surveys enhance the efficacy of monetary policy and also brings inclusivity to its working Conducting surveys that meet the highest standards of robustness is a formidable task as all statisticians know the RBI is fortunate to be guided in this regard by a technical advisory committee on surveys comprising statisticians of the finest mettle and repute The difficult part for a professional statistician working in a central bank lies in communicating survey findings to the lay public and employing the insights gleaned from them for monetary policy purposes For instance the RBIs inflation expectations survey provides quantifiable estimates of households perceptions of the current inflation situation These perceptions are significantly higher than outcomes measured by official statistics In the May 2023 round of the survey households felt that inflation was ruling at 88 per cent whereas the CPI released by the NSO for that month on June 12 showed that retail inflation declined to 43 per cent What is missed in the narrative is that households are essentially backwardlooking in their assessment of inflation conditions They form their expectations on the basis of the prices of salient items in the consumption basket that they encountered during the last weekly or monthly purchase In May 2023 the CPI showed cereals inflation at 127 per cent spices inflation at 179 per cent milk inflation at 89 per cent tur dal inflation at 168 per cent liquified petroleum gas LPG inflation at 111 per cent and open market kerosene inflation at 372 per cent In fact 40 out of the 299 items comprising the CPI recorded double digit inflation in May Yet analysts question the apparent dissonance between the surveys findings and the published CPI Our view is that the utility of the survey lies in providing a sense of future direction rather than of level The survey also sheds light on the variance of inflation expectations indicating their anchoring or deanchoring It also alerts us about the bias that needs to be controlled for while reading the results Another instance relates to the consumer confidence survey The results have been interpreted as consumers being eternally pessimistic about the current situation but ever optimistic about the future the indomitable power of hope rather than an objective assessment of the underlying macroeconomic situation and outlook What is not focused on is the gap between current perceptions and expectations India is emerging out of a onceinacentury pandemic which stretched this gap to its widest level in the surveys history but it is now closing rapidly a phenomenon last seen in 2019 before the onset of the pandemic The scars of the pandemic are deep but they are healing and consumers that make up around 60 per cent of GDP are getting their groove back Seen from this perspective the future does look a little brighter and the messages from the survey a little more credible emboldening us to expand its coverage into rural areas Our enterprise surveys provide nuggets of priceless forwardlooking information for formulating monetary policy such as the level of capacity utilisation CU in key manufacturing industries and sentiments on future expectations of CU the outlook for demand price expectations both input and output and a view of employment evolution These results enrich our growth and inflation forecasts Another area of discomfort in the public perception is that the results of these surveys are expressed as net responses the proportion of respondents expressing optimism minus the proportion expressing pessimism Illustratively the March 2023 round of the industrial outlook survey showed that in the fourth quarter of 202223 the sentiment on cost of raw materials was negative at 591 suggesting extreme pessimism about input costs Yet a comparison with the results of the previous three rounds covering the rest of the year would show a 25 percentage points swing in the proportion of those expressing improvement from 844 Q1 725 Q2 and 649 Q3 If over the year therefore the proportion of respondents that felt input costs are high has been steadily and substantially falling the correct reading should have been that it is providing real information on the actual softening of input cost pressures that we are experiencing today with wholesale prices in deflation 35 per cent in May 2023 Forecasts Intermediate Targets of Forwardlooking Monetary Policy The conduct of monetary policy has undergone several regime shifts over the course of history causing changes in goals operating procedures and nominal anchors Very briefly the Bretton Woods system employed fixed exchange rates as the nominal anchor of monetary policy until their abandonment in the early 1970s when exchange rates began to float This was followed by regimes of credit allocation and rationing in which credit targets performed the role of nominal anchor a brief period of targeting monetary aggregates during the 1980s a twilight zone marked by the checklist or multiple indicator approach and eventually inflation targeting IT that began in the early 1990s and gains popularity by the day In the IT framework inflation is the nominal anchor of monetary policy The inflation forecast functions as an intermediate target which provides a proximate view of the unobservable goal variables Hence the forecast assumes vital significance requiring comprehensiveness in terms of crystallising all available information and precision in viewing the future trajectory of inflation In the RBI forecasting follows a threestage procedure In the first stage contemporaneous variables including indicators of sentiment are chosen from their point of view of their relevance to key components of GDP and inflation They are aggregated into nowcasts that predict the very recent past and the present for which no official data are available because of inherent lags On this base the next stage involves full information nearterm forecasts valid for the next 12 months with key assumptions imposed as exogenous conditions They average out the results of several small time series and structural models based on past forecasting performance These nearterm forecasts are presented as part of the resolution of the monetary policy committee In the third stage these nearterm forecasts are fed into macroeconomic models in which some parameters are calibrated and others are estimated These models produce longerterm forecasts which are disseminated to the public through a semiannual monetary policy report In a flexible inflation targeting framework forecasts also perform the role of communication tools giving the public a sense of the future direction of monetary policy besides being intermediate targets as explained earlier Consequently public attention tends to be focused on these forecasts and nearterm deviations from actual outcomes are subjected to animated debate Some caveats are in order here First the overlapping shocks of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine resulted in massive structural disruptions including gaps in data availability which produced large and persistent but unavoidable errors Second a large portion of deviations when they occur stem from the exogenous assumptions we set as initial conditions These assumptions relate to the price of crude oil the exchange rate of the rupee the monsoon global growth the fiscal stance and changes in structural policies all of which are determined outside our forecasting framework and arguably outside the realm of domestic monetary policy Third forecast errors are used as a learning experience by us resulting in correctional steps and additional information gathering incidentally the RBI publishes these deviations regularly and explains reasons underlying them as mandated in legislation andor supporting regulations In fact this has resulted in our nearterm forecasts becoming increasingly accurate over time Fourth our analysis of forecast errors indicates there is no systematic bias and that they are offsetting when assessed over a sufficiently longtime span Another aspect of the forecasts is the manner in which they are communicated to the public The RBI expresses its forecasts in the form of fan charts picturising the balance of risks or uncertainty surrounding them within confidence intervals Arguably the choice of communicating tool could have been a point forecast like a dot plot but the fan chart is consistent with the high uncertainty characterising developing economies like India more than half of the CPI comprises food and fuel which are vulnerable to exogenous shocks Furthermore unlike the individualistic dot plot our fan chart marks a consensus among the members of the MPC Exploring New Frontiers We are in the middle of the fourth industrial revolution Unlike its predecessor waves which were driven by steamwater power electricity and computing this wave is being powered by artificial intelligence AI and big data whereby intelligent machines are given the ability to think and act like humans Like every other thing in its path AI is also transforming monetary policy and its conduct Since 2018 our initial forays have strengthened into formal work streams dovetailed into the monetary policy processes In the DSIM online food and house prices are collected and analysed satellite imagery and climatic factors are used for early assessment of crop production and likely movements in food prices newspaperbased sentiment analysis is conducted for key macroeconomic variables including the policy rate and analysis of the impact of central bank communication including speeches by the Governor are regularly undertaken The objective is to create leading and coincident indicators from information that is available on a near real time basis thereby overcoming the constraints faced by traditional data Since these inputs are drawn from high dimensional high frequency data from nontraditional sources they warrant new techniques such as text mining natural language processing NLP deep learning and other machine learning tools These efforts help to complement and validate our traditional forecasts greatly enhances the efficacy of monetary policy AI has also enabled critical selfassessment of monetary policy communication including responding to new questions that are emerging For instance how do specific terms like open mouth operations influence the public psyche In Governors monetary policy statements we have found that the use of words like nimble and watchful inspire public confidence The overall assessment is that while the readability of various monetary policy statements has been maintained periods of uncertainty induced by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine made them lengthier reflecting efforts to explain in greater detail to the public what then appeared like intractable situations A recent finding from the application of NLP to the MPCs minutes is that sentiments expressed by the members were deeply impacted by the war in Ukraine but synergy and cohesion as a group seems to have transcended individualistic views on specific aspects Another interesting aspect is how monetary policy communication is perceived in the media Statements providing confidence in the economy and financial stability are the most preferred in terms of quotations and headlines Content coverage is another indicator of the medias choice of transmission of messages put out by the RBI Conclusion It is said that economics studies uncertainty but statistics measures uncertainty By reducing uncertainty to a quantifiable value statistics enable monetary policy to manage its tradeoffs and chart its course through known and unknown unknowns This enhances accountability and hence credibility That is the power of statistics For my colleagues in the DSIM this empowerment involves riding an endless roller coaster every day through layers of data collection validation processing analysis and research This is true not just of the important monetary policy requirements tasked to them but also of almost all other functions of the RBI Besides their unshakable commitment to their calling they have shown remarkable adaptability in embracing new challenges techniques and data sources It is they who make the difference In an influential view the numbers have no way of speaking for themselves it is our statisticians who speak for them and imbue them with meaning5 To my DSIM colleagues

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1373&fn=2759,Date Inaugural Address by Shri Shaktikanta Das Governor at the 17th Statistics Day Conference organised by the Department of Statistics and Information Management Reserve Bank of India on June 30 2023 Mumbai,The Reserve Bank has a rich tradition of generating accurate and timely data policyoriented and topical economic research publication of statutory and other themebased reports and knowledgesharing I am happy to participate in the 17th annual Statistics Day Conference of the Reserve Bank and also to launch the Centralised Information Management System or CIMS which is our next generation data warehouse Over two decades ago the Reserve Bank was among the pioneer central banks to set up its data warehouse Considering the developments during the interregnum it is natural that we migrate to a new platform with a more enriched orientation 2 Celebration of the National Statistics Day which marks the birth anniversary of Professor Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis provides an opportunity for sensitising the general public especially the younger minds about the discipline of statistics which provides scientific basis for taking informed decisions across diverse domains Prof Mahalanobis was instrumental in institutionalising statistics in India both as an academic discipline and as a policy devising tool He always approached the subject as an applied science capable of addressing real life questions We are reminded of practical application of statistics such as his analysis of half a century data on floods which influenced the construction of the Hirakud dam and the second Fiveyear Plan model which focussed on rapid industrialisation of the Indian economy All these demonstrated how statistics can address complex problems and drive progress As we pay our tribute to Prof Mahalanobis on his birth anniversary we continue to draw inspiration from the sagacious endeavours of this great visionary 3 I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Dr CR Rao the living legend in statistics and a close associate of Prof Mahalanobis who has been selected for the prestigious and long overdue International Prize in Statistics in 2023 Incidentally we have two of his distinguished students Professor SRS Varadhan and Professor Rajeeva Karandikar amidst us today They will be talking about interesting areas in statistical theory and applications later during the day 4 Evidence and analysis are core inputs in policy formulation Of late macroeconomic policy making and monitoring processes have become more data intensive with considerable reliance being placed on detailed study of developments interlinkages among factors identification of patterns forecasts of possible path and scenario analysis all aided by the discipline of statistics A prerequisite of such analysis is the availability of timely and credible data with the three Cs of data quality ie completeness correctness and consistency 5 Unlike the economic variables that are directly compiled from transaction systems which are timely and robust certain core macroeconomic aggregates such as gross domestic product GDP growth and price inflation where compilation process is dependent on multiple channels are available with a time lag globally Also their early estimates which are indeed very useful are compiled with limited set of inputs and partial data and are prone to multiple and sometimes significant revisions Policymakers who use them as inputs however do not have the luxury of revising decisions in retrospect1 Monetary policymakers supplement official estimates with information on auxiliary variables to have firmer assessment and minimise policy errors emanating from data revision Statistical information is also used by businesses and households in making assessment of the economic situation and firming up their nearterm expectations 6 To our advantage technological developments have kept pace with the rising dimensions and depth of economic activities to support their detailed monitoring Advances in remote sensing automation digitisation information management ecosystem text mining natural language processing artificial intelligence and nowcasting provide us with quick and comprehensive information on activities Their optimal utilisation has supported and can further refine compilation of macroeconomic aggregates and increase their efficacy in navigating through uncertainties 7 The Reserve Bank uses statistical methods in almost all its core functions and is both a compiler and a user of macrofinancial statistics as well as other economic data collected through regular surveys The Reserve Bank follows latest global prescriptions and best practices and pursues standardisation across domains to generate consistent comparable and harmonised statistics We treat data as public good and are disseminating increasingly more data in public domain for use by analysts researchers and general public Our preference is for general dissemination over meeting individual requirements 8 The Reserve Bank established its first enterprisewide data warehouse the Central Database Management System CDBMS which was accessible to its internal users since 2002 A large part of this data system was placed in the public domain as the Database on Indian Economy DBIE portal in November 2004 Over the years DBIE has evolved from a simple data repository to an information processing and management system which has become the Reserve Banks data dissemination platform The DBIE remains very popular among domestic and international researchers analysts and general public especially students It received over 25 lakh hits in May 2023 9 The Reserve Banks Regulations Review Authority 20 RRA 20 has recently made several recommendations on streamlining reporting mechanism and reduction in regulatory compliance burden Many of these recommendations have already been implemented and others are in various stages of implementation A major recommendation on systembased submission of the remaining emailbased reporting will be implemented through the Centralised Information Management System CIMS in the coming months 10 Our investment in technology for information management periodic reviews continuous engagement with reporting entities and technological upgradation at their end have paid rich dividends in terms of improving coverage quality and timeliness of data During the COVID19 lockdown period our reporting system ensured business continuity the flow of validated information was seamless the work from home WFH environment was actively supported and the public dissemination of information went uninterrupted 11 With todays launch of CIMS we embark on a major change in our information management framework for handling the massive data flow aggregation analysis public dissemination and data governance This system uses stateoftheart technology to manage Big data and will serve as a platform for power users to carry out data mining text mining visual analytics and advanced statistical analysis connecting data from multiple domains such as financial external fiscal corporate and real sectors as well as prices In short to medium term it would lead to a paradigm shift in the Reserve Banks economic analysis as well as supervision monitoring and enforcement across multiple domains 12 The new system is starting with reporting by scheduled commercial banks and will be gradually extended to urban cooperative banks UCBs and nonbanking financial companies NBFCs Incidentally with the CIMS going live the first weekly statistical supplement WSS which is the Reserve Banks weekly data release on its own operations and on developments in banking and financial markets was compiled and processed in the CIMS for the week ended June 23 2023 It will disseminate more data for public use and will also support online statistical analysis by external users at their end Regulated entities will also have access to their past data and their assessment on quality parameters in the new system 13 Any transition in system with multiple dimensions involving large number of entities is prone to teething trouble and therefore our teams will support the reporting entities for smooth transition wherever necessary Several new features will also be augmented in the coming months 14 This conference is being organised against the backdrop of two international events with focus on statistics one the principle of data for development is an integral part of the work stream under Indias ongoing presidency of G20 and second the upcoming membership of India in the United Nations Statistical Commission UNSC after a gap of two decades I note that results of four research papers covering various aspects of G20 economies will also be presented today 15 Let me now conclude with the words of Prof Mahalanobis We shall naturally devote closer attention to the collection and analysis of data relating to India but we shall try to study all Indian questions in relation to world problems2 Drawing inspiration from these words let me also give a message to our statisticians in the Reserve Bank as you look for a wider canvas in your profession I urge all of you to abide by the spirit of these words of Prof Mahalanobis 16 I wish all success to todays deliberations which I am sure will ignite our teams particularly the younger officers to strive for professional excellence in their commitment to serve the nation

to the Reserve Bank of India henceforth RBI We are honoured to host this conference in physical mode after the arduous isolation imposed by the pandemic The hill town of Lonavala an ancient resting place for travellers and traders is nestled in Indias soontobe monsoondrenched western ghats a chain of mountains running 30 to 50 km inland parallel to Indias west coast across six provinces We do hope that its verdant ambience will dispel all pandemic blues and provide a salubrious backdrop for this Conference which has Productivity Growth and Resilience in the Asian Economies as its theme The Conference itself is a tribute to the fortitude and perseverance displayed by Asian economies through the pandemic and the war in Ukraine Before I turn to the subject of my address today I thought a journey down memory lane might be appropriate for the occasion The Asia KLEMS has a short but eventful history replete with promoting the building of databases and conducting international productivity comparisons among Asian economies The first Asia KLEMS conference was held in Tokyo in 2011 The abiding interest in that Conference was in productivity growth going by the papers presented a theme to which we return today The next four Conferences were hosted in Seoul Taipei Tokyo and Beijing in which attention diversified to setting up the KLEMS database and accounting framework structural change and sources of productivity growth methodological issues and productivity gaps growth and productivity and the role of factors such as information and communication technology or ICT intangibles trade and labour markets At the time of the fifth Asia KLEMS meeting in 2019 India was selected as the venue for the next conference Unfortunately COVID19related restrictions on international travel prevented the conference from being convened in 2021 but finally the sixth Asia KLEMS conference is being held today India KLEMS which is a part of Asia KLEMS and of the larger world KLEMS initiative aims to measure and analyse productivity growth in India by using the KLEMS framework It started in 2009 with financial support from the RBI From 2015 the India KLEMS Project was nurtured at the Centre for Development Economics CDE Delhi School of Economics by Prof KL Krishna and his team who have been making valuable contributions to the greater KLEMS initiative right from its inception From 2022 the RBI is the home of India KLEMS and its database which consists of inputs KLEMS output gross value added gross value of output and total factor productivity TFP estimates from 198081 to 201920 AprilMarch The next update of the database with the incorporation of data for 202021 is scheduled for August 2023 Talking KLEMS to hardcore KLEMS practitioners is a formidable challenge and I shall not venture where angels fear to tread In the rest of my address I will therefore try to provide a users perspectives on how we read KLEMS data for policy purposes II Some Stylised Trends It is widely believed that a structural slowdown has been spreading across the global economy after growth peaked in 2010 About half of this slowdown can be attributed to demographic factors ageing population slowing workingage cohort increases and declining labour force participation Alongside growth rates of investment and total factor productivity are declining The engine of trade which powered the global economy in the 1980s and 1990s has also weakened considerably Gains from better education and health have been diminishing as improvements in education and health care systems go abegging for lack of investments More recently powerful forces have accentuated the global slowdown financial crises recurring with disturbing intensity the onceinacentury pandemic and the war in Ukraine all of which have left lasting scars Accordingly the 2020s 202230 may turn out to be another lost decade preceded by the ten lost years from 2010 It has been argued that the global potential growth rate the maximum growth rate that an economy can sustain in the long term at full employment and full capacity without igniting inflation its speed limit if you will has fallen by close to a full percentage point in 201121 relative to 2000102 The global slowdown has pulled down advanced economies AEs and emerging and developing economies EMDEs alike but it has imposed a major setback on the latter pushing back their chances of catchup or convergence Consequently their capacity to lift their populations out of poverty reduce inequality and achieve the aspirational goals of development is endangered as well as their ability to harness the benefits of newer technologies stemming from green transition and the digital revolution What is worrisome is that for EMDEs all the drivers of growth factor reallocations human capital formation the share of working age population investment growth are losing strength at the same time This could stall the process of development that has been underway since the middle of the preceding century Meanwhile policy uncertainty at the global level has surged and forces of deglobalisation and trade and finance disintegration have gained ground vitiating the environment in which EMDEs sought to harness developmental opportunities and manage their challenges The World Bank estimates that for EMDEs potential growth as defined earlier fell to 50 per cent a year during 201121 from 60 per cent a year during 200010 and will slow further to an average of 40 per cent a year during 202230 In particular investment growth is likely to be insufficient to reach prepandemic trends In the view of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD greenfield foreign direct investment in industry remains fragile especially in developing countries There is significant risk that the momentum for recovery in international investment will stall prematurely hampering efforts to boost finance for sustainable development3 Turning to Asia the real GDP growth surge in east Asia which includes the Pacific region following the 199798 Asian financial crisis lost steam during the period between 201121 in a largely cyclical downturn With the onset of the COVID19 pandemic there was a sharp fall in fixed capital investment and labour supply which still remain below prepandemic levels The weakening of human and physical capital will likely weigh on medium to longterm growth prospects of the region in an environment of reconfiguration of supply chains elevated debt levels tighter financing conditions and uncertainty related to trade and technology transfer Over the period 202230 the regions potential output growth is projected by the World Bank to slow to 46 per cent a year from 62 per cent a year in 201121 Falling TFP growth is estimated to account for about threefifths of the slowdown with the remaining twofifths attributable equally to slowing labour supply growth and capital accumulation Economic activity in south Asia rebounded strongly from the recession caused by the pandemic when its large informal sector was hard hit by job and income losses Output in the region is on track to grow by about 60 per cent a year between 2022 and 2030 faster than the 2010s annual average of 55 per cent and only moderately slower than growth in the 2000s This will make it the fastest growing EMDE region in the remainder of this decade as demographic trends expand the working age population the investment rate remains elevated and productivity growth continues to benefit from the shift of resources away from agriculture and informal activity Although population growth is expected to moderate labour force growth will be supported by stabilisation of the participation rate after two decades of decline South Asias potential growth is projected to slow only marginally to 61 per cent a year on average in the 2020s from 62 per cent a year in the 2010s The forecast of potential output growth through 2030 is underpinned mainly by a projected recovery in TFP growth In central Asia4 the pandemic and the war in Ukraine have taken a grievous toll reversing recent progress in raising living standards and leaving deep economic wounds among vulnerable populations The regions output is estimated to have shrunk by 03 per cent in 2022 and is expected to flatten in 2023 weakened by erosion of labour productivity muted investment and scarred human capital Potential output growth is projected to slow from an annual average pace of 36 per cent per year over 201121 to 3 per cent per year over 202230 In west Asia5 GDP growth has been uneven over the past two decades slowing in the 2010s under the effects of political turmoil and military conflict The World Bank estimates that potential growth halved between the 2000s and 2010s with the slowdown driven by broadbased decelerations in capital stock in total factor productivity and in workingage populations The pandemic has further damaged these drivers with output contracting by 36 per cent in 2020 A rebound in 2021 was insufficient to reverse the decline in output Potential output growth is projected to remain lacklustre growing by about 25 per cent a year during 202230 A reduction in the contribution of labour to potential growth is expected to be partly offset by an anaemic improvement in TFP growth and stronger investment Human capital accumulation is projected to slow owing to weaker growth in the workingage population To sum up these trends global growth was slowing down ahead of the pandemic relative to its performance up to the global financial crisis GFC This loss of speed was led by AEs but EMDEs were pulled in by 20102011 Only east and south Asia proved resilient and maintained historical growth trends Even in these regions the share of labour in output and its contribution by way of quality has fallen while capital accumulation has moderated It is said that east and south Asia will become the worlds centre of gravity and capital accumulation will continue to contribute more than half of GDP growth6 The rest will have to come from productivity a subject to which I will turn shortly Potential growth is weakening broadly across Asia with all drivers TFP growth labour force growth and capital accumulation slackening East Asia is expected to be the EMDE region with the sharpest decline in both aggregate and per capita potential growth during 202230 mainly reflecting slower capital accumulation and TFP growth The second largest decline in potential growth in 202230 is projected for central Asia from the continued weakness in labour force growth Potential growth is projected to rise in west Asia in 202230 as strengthening TFP growth offsets demographic headwinds to potential growth The secular slowdown over the last decade and expectations of another slow decade ahead warrants a renewed exploration of the linkages between physical capital investment improvements in human capital and exploitation of technological advancement In an environment in which populations across the world are either ageing or declining and investment rates are trapped in a longterm deceleration including foreign direct investment it is perhaps an opportune moment to focus on productivity growth as the means of arresting the downturn and charting a new trajectory of pushing outwards the growth possibility frontier It has been observed that productivity is not everything but in the long run it is almost everything7 This is the theme of my address today III The Paradox of Productivity Globally productivity growth has undergone a prolonged slowdown since 2010 after a brief recovery in the years immediately following the GFC This deceleration in TFP is more pronounced in EMDEs than in their AE peers India has also suffered a decline in TFP growth although moderate relative to the global experience the average TFP growth rate in India slowed from 13 per cent during the period 2000 to 2007 to 12 per cent during 2011 to 2019 as against the EMDE average of 02 per cent and the global average of 01 per cent8 TFP growth accounted for about 20 per cent of Indias aggregate GDP growth during this period coinciding with the contribution of both capital and labour declining GDP growth in India has remained relatively resilient averaging close to 70 per cent during 2000 to 2022 with some ebbing of capital formation and employment growth in sync with the deceleration in TFP growth For the period 202230 the World Bank projects Indias potential growth to reflect the outlook for south Asia Underlying the generalised productivity slowdown are several confounding puzzles at least from the policy practitioners point of view I will focus on a few important ones in the interest of time First the slackening of productivity is synchronised across jurisdictions apparently impervious to differentials in levels of development inherent heterogeneity in country characteristics and differences in policy responses9 As the economist Alistair Dieppe points out in a factor modelling framework TFP growth is shown to be the one of the most important correlates of common developments in GDP growth Second this comovement of TFP across geographies suggests that it could be driven by common factors In this context it has been pointed out that cyclical factors including changing factor utilisation accounted for a third of the slowdown in the productivity in the post GFC period10 This suggests that fluctuations in productivity are actually demanddriven calling into question the received wisdom on the long run neutrality of demand with respect to productivity11 It also does not fit well with the observed long run slowdown in productivity which suggests that structural factors may be at work whereas cyclical drivers are more shortrun and reversible by definition Third the fall in productivity growth is coexisting with a slew of new technological developments such as cloud computing big data analytics robotics fintech and the digital revolution to name a few Once again the Solow paradox of the 1970s and 1980s you can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics12 seems to have come alive Some proximate hypotheses compete for explanatory power in unravelling the productivity puzzle First there is the mismeasurement view which would seek further refinements in the manner in which factor inputs and their quality are measured so as to yield uncontaminated estimates of TFP13 As Dale Jorgensen a founding father of the KLEMS framework used to emphasise the lesson of decades of experience is that these parameters are highly sensitive to methods of measurement There are also the output effects of adding newer inputs like digitalisation to be considered As the OECD has argued digital technologies are transforming our economies and seem to offer a vast potential to enhance the productivity of firms14 Second it is argued that new technological developments are still in the installation stage and hence they are producing only localised gains in productivity15 a GPT16 does not deliver productivity gains on arrival17 Raising productivity will need a sufficiently large stock of the new capital and complementary business process changes involving human capital and organisational changes in investment decisions have to be in place to integrate it into production in order to harness its benefits18 For instance it has been found that investments in IT yields substantial benefits but over a gestation period peaking after about seven years19 Moreover access to cutting edge technologies remains uneven among countries and between firms nearly half of SMEs and about a third of large firms in emerging and developing Asia report difficulty in obtaining financing as the major impediment to technology adoption20 Commensurately aggregate RD expenditure has slowed down in Asia and the world at large21 Other explanations of the productivity slowdown have also been offered in terms of the leapfrogging of many EMDEs over the relatively productive and labourabsorbing manufacturing sector to the relatively less productive services sector trade and technology fragmentation disruptions in global value chains and the possibility of dissipation of profits innovative firms displace lagging firms from the market but without adding commensurately to output22 IV Conclusion Given that multiple factors could be at work a multipronged approach woven into a comprehensive policy intervention is needed to reignite and sustain productivity growth The policy response has to be powered by technological capital deepening accompanied by long term investment in research and development to nurture a competitive innovation ecosystem skill development through sustained educational attainments and training and building up the physical infrastructure EMDEs need to leverage the potential of the services sector to drive productivity growth Investing in ICT infrastructure securing reduction in trade costs like those associated with shipping logistics and regulation and supportive businessenabling reforms could help to engage the private sector in partnering in this endeavour In addition raising labour force participation rates especially among women and older workers could also boost productivity but this will require investments in workability retraining and acquisition of new skills in step with changing technology The OECD has cited digitalisation as a key avenue for future productivity growth by harnessing the power to rapidly diffuse and replicate ideas informational goods and business processes at near zero marginal cost Easing and expanding access to finance for small and medium enterprises can generate productivity bursts especially in EMDEs Central banks are stakeholders in this effort in view of their mandates of macroeconomic and financial stability A deeper understanding of productivity trends is needed by them in order to judge the position of the economy on the business cycle so as to fashion appropriate policy responses that ensure sustained noninflationary economic growth In turn this will promote financial market confidence and the overall flow of finance in the economy Against this backdrop the theme of this Conference is indeed timely and relevant Your deliberations will surely provide deeper insights into the structural drivers of productivity and factor accumulation that create the conditions for sustainable development New challenges including climate change digitalisation and the reshaping of global value chains have to be addressed and new opportunities have to be seized The Conference brings together the best minds experiences and learnings on a subject of topical importance I am sure that your discussions will enrich our understanding of productivity and growth in Asia and lead to better policy outcomes I thank you all for your participation and wish you success in crossing another milestone in the journey of Asia KLEMS Thank you 1 Inaugural address delivered by Michael

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1347&fn=2759,Date South Asias Current Macroeconomic Challenges and Policy Priorities,The Reserve Bank has a rich tradition of generating accurate and timely data policyoriented and topical economic research publication of statutory and other themebased reports and knowledgesharing I am delighted to have been invited by the IMF to join this distinguished gathering here today to discuss pathways to resilient sustainable and inclusive growth in South Asia I am happy to note that the conference proceedings will be anchored by the research findings and policy recommendations of the book titled South Asias Path to Resilient Growth In the current international setting global trade and growth outlook appear uninspiring and policies have to be conducted amid a whirlwind of uncertainty At such critical times conferences of this nature can help us better understand the evolving scenarios and policy tradeoffs In my address today I shall briefly cover some of my thoughts on South Asias Current Macroeconomic Challenges and Policy Priorities 2 Looking back into history the South Asian region has been a key hub of ideas commerce art and culture etc The Indus Valley civilisation was among the three earliest civilisations on earth and was the most extensive In the so called middle ages trade and commerce flourished in a variety of commodities such as spices precious metals and other minerals handicrafts and food items Overall the South Asian region has had an outsized influence on the progress of civilisation and trade in the world Currently the region accounts for about 25 per cent of world population With a median age of 27 years it is one of the youngest regions in the world The average growth rate of the region has accelerated from 3 per cent in the 1970s to about 7 per cent in the latest decade prepandemic Consequently percapita income levels have risen alongside notable progress on key development parameters As per the IMF estimates South Asia contributes nearly 15 per cent to global growth led by India and Bangladesh The region also receives onefifth of total remittance flows in the world 3 The South Asian region has grown responding to formidable global challenges in the past Following the food crisis of the 1960s the region successfully implemented the Green Revolution After the oil shocks of the 1970s emigration from South Asia to West Asia became one of the largest marketdriven labour flows This in turn led to a significant increase in remittance flows to the region The Asian financial crisis of 1997 impacted the South Asian countries in terms of surges in capital outflows and exchange market pressures Over the years as a crisis prevention strategy the South Asian countries prioritised sound macroeconomic policies and embraced financial sector reforms focusing on competition prudential regulation enhanced transparency audit and accounting standards These measures helped in preserving macro stability while sustaining integration of domestic economies with the global economy 4 In recent years multiple shocks in particular the COVID19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have dampened the economic prospects of the South Asian region as in other parts of the world Some countries in the region have also been contending with the ramifications of unsustainable debt and climate change induced events Consequently they have been seeking recourse to the IMFs financing facilities Notwithstanding these challenges as per the World Economic Outlook database October 2022 of the IMF India Bangladesh and Maldives would be among the fastest growing economies in the world in 2022 and 2023 According to the Asian Development Banks December 2022 outlook the South Asian regions GDP is projected to grow at 65 per cent in 2022 and 63 per cent in 2023 5 The World Bank estimates that regional cooperation could be a winwin situation for all countries of the region1 For example intraregional trade is currently only onefifth of its potential implying an annual shortfall of US44 billion The World Bank assessment also suggests that a common electricity market for Bangladesh Bhutan India and Nepal can yield savings of US17 billion in capital costs Investment in transport and logistics could help reduce the cost for container shipments in South Asia According to a study by the IMF 2019 on South Asia more than 150 million people will enter the South Asian labour force by 2030 The dependency ratio is expected to continue ebbing for almost two decades indicating the strong demographic dividend the region is set to reap Policy Priorities I would now like to focus on some of the desirable policy priorities for the South Asian region I have identified six such policy priorities Taming Inflation 6 Multiple external shocks in the form of COVID related global supply chain disruptions food and energy crisis following the war in Ukraine and financial market volatility arising from the aggressive monetary policy tightening have exerted sustained price pressures in the South Asian economies as in other parts of the world During the first three quarters of 2022 food price inflation in South Asia averaged more than 20 per cent The regions heavy dependence on imported fossil fuels has made it vulnerable to imported fuel inflation For successful disinflation credible monetary policy actions accompanied by targeted supply side interventions fiscal trade policy and administrative measures have become the key instruments While the recent softening of commodity prices and supply chain bottlenecks should help in lowering inflation going ahead risks to growth and investment outlook may rise if inflation persists at high level Prioritising price stability may therefore be the optimal policy choice in the current context for the region The approach to disinflation however needs to be mindful of the rising risks to the growth outlook in an environment of deteriorating prospects for global growth and trade activity Containing External Debt Vulnerabilities 7 The surge in external debt in recent years and associated vulnerabilities have undermined macroeconomic stability in several countries of the South Asian region External debt which was already elevated in low and middleincome countries that include all South Asian economies in the prepandemic period surged to US 93 trillion in 2021 from US 82 trillion in 2019 an increase of US 11 trillion 8 The Debt Service Suspension Initiative DSSI was set up by the G20 in May 2020 Up to December 2021 an estimated US 129 billion of debt service was deferred According to the World Bank 60 per cent of the 73 DSSIeligible countries are at high risk of debt distress or are already experiencing it It is estimated that total external debt service payments on public and publicly guaranteed debt by poorest countries may rise by 35 per cent to over US 62 billion in 2022 and to remain high up to 2024 due to rising global interest rates and the compounding of interest on DSSI debt service deferrals 9 Even though the participation of private creditors was encouraged in the DSSI their response has not been encouraging There has been a notable shift in the creditor composition of low and middleincome countries between 2010 and 2021 The share of lending by private creditors in longterm public and publicly guaranteed debt was 61 per cent in 2021 46 per cent in 2010 and the share of debt owed to bondholders was 47 per cent in 2021 29 per cent in 2010 10 A distinct shift in the creditor base over time in favour of private lenders and nonParis Club official creditors has added a new dimension to debt restructuring processes for the lowincome International Development Assistance IDAeligible debtor countries The share of debt owed to nonParis Club creditors rose to 68 per cent in 2021 from 42 per cent in 2010 The increasing reliance on private creditors has raised debt servicing costs and complicated creditor coordination in debt resolution efforts During 20102021 the average maturity on loans from private creditors was 12 years as compared with 26 years for loans from official creditors and the average interest rate on loans from private creditors was 5 per cent visvis 2 per cent on loans from official creditors 11 The role of multilateral organisations particularly the IMF and the World Bank becomes crucial in making debt treatment efforts more effective while also strengthening the mechanism of recording reporting and analysis of debt data so as to enhance transparency and preserve debt sustainability The IMFs role in capacity building in the region with a focus on region specific macro dynamics policy effectiveness challenges and economic aspirations of the nations would also be helpful Raising Productivity 12 While sustained and broadbased economic recovery remains the current policy focus it is necessary to undertake deep structural reforms to raise the potential growth trajectories of the economies in the South Asian region Ongoing global realignment of supply chains green transition and advances in technology offer new opportunities for investment and growth but policies would need to create the congenial climate for attracting new private investment with public sector taking the lead in areas that can create large positive externalities such as infrastructure education and health 13 In this context let me highlight some specific areas of policy priority First undertaking desirable structural change would require an improvement in resource allocation moving production from low productive sectors to high productive sectors and promotion of innovation Second skill mismatches a major constraint to resource reallocation would warrant policy focus on education and skill upgradation This is particularly important to the South Asian region as the favourable demography of the region would require that production processes must be labourintensive while being globally competitive Third while free trade and FDI have been conventionally congenial for diffusion of technology and augmentation of productivity the regions investment on RD must also increase from the current low levels and the policy environment for scientific research and startups must be made more rewarding Fourth investment in physical infrastructure energy transportation telecommunication which are prime drivers of productivity growth have to be enhanced 14 Infrastructure in the contemporary world of digital revolution would also include digital infrastructure data centres cellular towers and fibre connectivity with an emphasis on scalability and resilience Fintech Ecommerce Ed Tech Health Tech and Food Tech are the new age growth propellers and need quality internet connectivity and reliable digital payments Strengthening Cooperation for Energy Security 15 The South Asian region has a high reliance on fossil fuels and imported energy making the region vulnerable to volatile oil gas and coal prices In view of the dominating influence of geopolitical factors in driving global energy market dynamics the region needs to strengthen energy cooperation arrangements so as to enhance resilience to external shocks 16 India and Bangladesh have already agreed to enhance the subregional connectivity in the energy sector by linking the power grids of the two countries synchronously The IndiaBangladesh Friendship Pipeline Project IBFPP a 130 km pipeline joining Siliguri in West Bengal and Parbatipur in Bangladesh would have a capacity to export petroleum products of one million metric tonnes per annum Other examples of cooperation include transportation of petroleum oil and lubricants across national jurisdictions Similarly crossborder petroleum products pipeline and joint venture hydroelectric projects are testimony to the immense scope for energy cooperation in the region 17 Harmonisation of testing processes performance and conservation standards and labelling criteria for electrical appliances in the region can contribute to regional energy security by promoting cost savings and by boosting efficiency and trade Integration of national power systems in the region could facilitate leveraging of untapped surplus hydropower while giving a fillip to development of solar and wind resources Programmes of bulk procurement and distribution of energyefficient appliances can be adopted by countries in the region India for example has the UJALA Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All scheme for distribution of LED bulbs at an affordable price Cooperation for a Greener Economy in the Region 18 South Asia is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change because of its large population and degradation of natural resources Extreme climate events floods droughts heat waves and unseasonal rains have increased over the past century As per the estimates of the International Finance Corporation IFC between 2018 and 2030 the funding requirements for investment in renewable energy greening the vehicle fleet and making future building stock green and resilient to climate change risks in South Asia alone would be over US410 billion US670 billion and US15 trillion respectively Besides financing access to technology and key minerals would also be critical for successful green transition Robust regional disaster management systems could help in ensuring timely and effective response to devastating climate events India spearheaded the global initiative and launched a Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure CDRI in 2019 Another initiative the International Solar Alliance ISA in partnership with the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet GEAPP aims at solarising the world The South Asian region must strengthen cooperation to make green transition of the region faster and at reasonable cost Promoting Tourism 19 Tourism is one of the major contributors to the GDP of some of the South Asian nations such as Maldives Nepal Bhutan and Sri Lanka As a sector tourism is a huge creator of employment The entire region has rich untapped potential in tourism In the recent period the tourism sector has somewhat revived in the region but is yet to reach preCOVID levels Intraregional tourist flows also remain below potential Regional initiatives such as religious tourism circuits spanning countries that have common historical and cultural footprint adventure tourism circuits and medicalspiritualAyurveda circuits can help boost the tourism industry and create a vibrant regional value chain Conclusion 20 With the global trade outlook for 2023 overcast greater intraregional trade in South Asia can enhance opportunities for growth and employment in the region At the central bank level a key dimension of cooperation in the region has been learning from each other on common goals and challenges such as infrastructure financing digital financial inclusion reducing the cost of crossborder remittances by linking with UPI system and unconventional monetary policy to name a few Rupee settlement of cross border trade and Central Bank Digital Currency CBDC where the RBI has already started moving forward can also be areas of greater cooperation in the future 21 The book to be released today provides plenty of new ideas for forging cooperation in the region and seeking solutions to common problems through right policy interventions I appreciate the efforts of the authors whose contributions made this book possible I do believe that the discussions during the day on policy choices will help us in reshaping the future prospects of the South Asian region Thank you 1

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1339&fn=2759,Date Inaugural Address by Shri Shaktikanta Das Governor Reserve Bank of India November 19 2022 at the Annual Research Conference of the Department of Economic and Policy Research Hyderabad,The Reserve Bank has a rich tradition of generating accurate and timely data policyoriented and topical economic research publication of statutory and other themebased reports and knowledgesharing I am delighted to be here with the economists of the Reserve Bank to inaugurate the annual research conference of the Department of Economic and Policy Research DEPR This conference is being held after a gap of more than three years While I have been regularly interacting with many of you individually or in groups to discuss various issues this is the first time that I am addressing all of you at one place 2 The economics profession today faces one of its toughest times as the global economy has been hit by multiple shocks one after the other These shocks have led to i globalisation of inflation with advanced economies AEs facing multidecadal high inflation ii sustained slowdown in economic growth and trade together with rising concerns about a possible global recession iii deteriorating global food and energy security situation iv realignment of global supply chains and policyinduced deglobalisation and v and weakening influence of multinational institutions in providing coordinated solutions to address global problems Emerging market economies EMEs face an additional challenge from threats to their external sector stability 3 Central banks given their mandate on preserving macro stability and the responsibility to be at the forefront of managing an economic crisis have a culture of diligently building synergies between research and policy making Research departments are thus empowered to work as the workhorse and as the think tank for ensuring continuous supply of reliable processed information analytical research and new ideas Such ideas help in designing time and state relevant policies Rapid advancement in technology has brought with it an avalanche of data The research departments role is to quickly process these data and derive meaningful inferences of relevance to policy making I am extremely happy that the research department of the Reserve Bank has been successfully adapting to these evolving challenges providing high quality research inputs on issues covering all key functions of the Bank and multiple dimensions of the economy The department has also been contributing to the greater public good by joining and guiding public discourse on key policy issues through its research reports and other publications 4 In my remarks today I would like to cover three important areas which touch upon the vital role of the research department in a central bank First I would like to talk about the challenges to our policy making in the context of the developments in the recent years both global and domestic that warranted robust data and research support Second I would highlight some of the important contributions of the research department in these turbulent times Third I would lay out several challenges ahead that one could anticipate requiring reimagination and rebalancing of the research function within the Reserve Bank I Recent Challenges in Policy Making and Research Issues 5 Given the enormity of the multiple shocks the world before the pandemic appears to have become a distant memory but I would like to start with a brief account of the key policy issues we were grappling with in the prepandemic period The global growth momentum was losing steam and domestically we were experiencing a slowdown in growth The key challenge was to understand the reasons behind the observed decline in growth and propose structural reforms and other policy changes Domestic inflation on the other hand was brought down averaging 39 per cent during the flexible inflation targeting regime June 2016 to February 2020 The research issue then was what factors contributed to the decline in inflation Another important policy challenge was the uncertainty about the time it would take to complete the balance sheet repair process or the twin balance sheet problem of corporates and banks and its ramifications for growth and financial stability Globally some of the empirical puzzles that received wide attention at that time were the weakening influence of economic slack on inflation or whether the Phillips curve is dead and little risk to inflation from quantitative easing or the missing inflation conundrum Widespread discontent about the negative spillover effects of globalisation had resulted in a growing shift towards protectionist policies challenging the prevailing wisdom of greater openness to maximise economic welfare 6 Since March 2020 three major shocks the COVID19 pandemic the war in Europe and the aggressive tightening of monetary policy across countries have posed very different set of challenges for economic research Policy responses had to be swift and wide ranging to contain the adverse effects on the overall macrofinancial conditions as well as sectoral vulnerabilities The first major challenge was data collection during the first wave of the pandemic and the associated statistical break in data During the second wave of the pandemic which was more lethal collecting information on sector level stress became even more important for designing targeted policy interventions The crisis thus created the opportunity to explore and harness the power of Big Data and strengthen direct feedback mechanisms while working from home 7 The pandemic also posed new research issues and analytical challenges for policy making These include i whether the pandemic caused a demand shock or a supply shock and which shock was transitory and which one durable ii the size and nature of policy stimulus required and their effectiveness iii the relationship of nationallocalised lockdowns and vaccination with economic activity iv the extent and nature of supply chain disruptions and its impact on inflation and growth v the asymmetric impact of the shockpace of recovery between contactintensive services and manufacturing and agriculture and vi the impact of the shock on household corporate and financial sector balance sheets Inflation and growth projections for monetary policy needed wider consultations with stakeholders and experts and use of surveybased data Generation of alternative nowcasts using Artificial Intelligence AI and Machine Learning ML techniques also gained more importance 8 The war in Europe brought with it new challenges just when the economy was about to normalise fully despite the third wave of the pandemic Suddenly the world encountered a severe food crisis and an energy crisis A new risk emerged in the form of fragmentation of the global economy driven by fast changing geopolitical considerations that brought to the fore the need for reducing dependence on any single source for critical supplies Commodity prices skyrocketed and supply chains knotted further These factors led to globalisation of inflation and policy makers were presented with a new set of research issues understanding the magnitude and likely persistence of these shocks the transmission channels of these shocks and the effectiveness of alternative policy tools As countries took recourse to trade policy measures tariff and nontariff and fiscal measures price freeze tax cuts and subsidies to the vulnerable the suitability of such measures in the Indian context also required focussed research attention 9 As inflation in systemically important AEs turned out to be persistent rather than transitory the third shock emanated in the form of aggressive tightening of monetary policy by the US Fed and subsequent unrelenting appreciation of the US dollar Spillovers to EMEs and to India were in the form of capital outflows depreciation pressures on currencies reserve losses and imported inflation Synchronised tightening of monetary policy globally has progressively increased the risk of a hard landing ie a recession to tame inflation India is however differently placed Age old research issues for EMEs like external sector sustainability assessment feasible range of policy options to preserve sustainability and analysis of their effectiveness have once again come to the forefront more so because the nature and size of the spillover risk is very different now 10 While I have presented some of the major policy challenges for us in the recent years let me also talk about how the research department of the RBI has responded to these challenges In the usual academic environment of a university or a research institute it is much easier to assess the impact of research done by the staff by aggregating data on published research output downloads citations and impact factor to give authors and organisations a score In contrast it is always hard to track in quantifiable terms the utility and impact of policy research undertaken in central banks a major part of which is used internally and not published I take this opportunity to place on record my appreciation of the excellent work done by the DEPR in these turbulent times Your research inputs have been very valuable in shaping several of our policies and actions II Contributions of DEPR and its role as a thinktank 11 For a fullservice central bank like the RBI its research function is all encompassing Accordingly the research department has a structure to be able to meet both the immediate as well as the strategic and policy research requirements It has trained researchers who not only specialise in specific areas but also respond to the challenge of working on any issue of immediate relevance Teamwork helps in pooling the comparative advantage of each and a robust internal peer review process ensures reliability and quality of research inputs before their use in policy formulation 12 As noted earlier standard models information collection systems and analytical frameworks used before COVID19 became inadequate to deal with the complex dynamics associated with multiple shocks that hit the economy Forecasting macroeconomic outcomes crucial for conducting forwardlooking monetary policy because of the usual lags in transmission required a revamped approach This involved strengthening the networks for direct collection of information from key stakeholders1 greater reliance on surveybased information wider use of AIML techniques and newmodified models to capture changes in the behaviour of economic agents to different shocks facing the economy A full information system with about 70 high frequency leadcoincident indicators of the economy and use of stateoftheart models to capture the timevarying dynamics helped us to generate results that passed the tests of robustness 13 Studying the impact of the pandemic on growthinflation dynamics and the outlook proposing policy interventions with rationale and expected outcomes and assessing the effectiveness of announced measures have been an integral part of the departments work all through the pandemic For inflation analysis increased attention was paid to interpreting prices data available from alternative sources when official data collection came to a halt during the early part of the pandemic Real time mobility indicators and market arrivals data for agricultural commodities were also put to use It became critical to study the role of supply and demand side factors as well as the behaviour of price markups in view of the lockdowns A supply chain pressure index for India was constructed in line with the global supply chain pressure index which is now updated and monitored regularly for policy purposes 14 When the inflation target reset date for another fiveyear period was fast approaching starting April 1 2021 a lively debate surfaced outside the Reserve Bank on the appropriateness of the 4 per cent inflation target with the 2 per cent tolerance band The researchers of the RBI undertook a comprehensive review of the monetary policy framework examining all relevant issues and recommended retention of the same target for the next five years We accepted this recommendation and sent proposals to the government accordingly The Report on Currency and Finance RCF 202021 with the theme Reviewing the Monetary Policy Framework has greatly helped in providing clarity on monetary policy and issues related with the framework 15 With the pandemics impact lingering and supply chain disruptions persisting an objective assessment of the scars of the pandemic and identification of reforms that could raise the countrys growth trajectory became an important research issue In the RCF 202122 with Revive and Reconstruct as theme the department examined in detail the effectiveness and limits of crisistime policies and the areas that needed policy attention to rejuvenate growth The revival of the annual RCF which had been published uninterruptedly since 1937 after a gap of seven years has been widely appreciated 16 A widely read publication of the department is the monthly State of the Economy article in the RBI bulletin which is being published since November 2020 This revived the tradition that began with the first issue of the bulletin in January 1947 but was interrupted in 1995 The bulletin also carries research articles on various topics of policy relevance that help inform and guide public debate Some of the important policy issues on which the economists of the department joined national debate through bulletin articles expressing their independent views include the impact of RBIs pandemic related policy measures the relationship between RBIs balance sheet size and inflation the equilibrium real interest rate in India drivers of movements in the yield curve COVID19 impact on food price markups rural urban inflation dynamics risk analysis of state finances the quality of public expenditure external debt sustainability and vulnerability privatisationconsolidation of public sector banks estimation of green GDP for India and the silent revolution in renewable energy 17 To further strengthen the general government statistics in India the maiden Report on Municipal Finances detailing the local government finances data was published by the department this month The report covers finances of 201 municipal corporations out of around 221 accounting for nearly 70 per cent of the finances of urban local bodies in India The coverage will be expanded going ahead 18 The department has also been expanding its scope of research activities to meet evolving challenges in areas such as climate change digitalisation and global spillovers The department collaborated with domain experts outside the Bank to compile KLEMS ie capital labour energy material and services data for India and has recently taken over the full responsibility for the same The department would also be hosting the 6th Asia KLEMS conference in India next year III Challenges Ahead for the Research Department 19 The world we face today is aptly described by using the acronym Vuca which stands for volatility uncertainty complexity and ambiguity Many of the backwardlooking models that run on past data may fall short of providing useful information and estimates for policy The department must further strengthen its consultative approach to collect firsthand information directly from the stakeholders When the department was faced with the challenge of explaining food inflation dynamics with greater certainty just before the pandemic it conducted a nationwide survey of farmers retailers and wholesalers The department would repeat the survey next month to understand the changes brought out by the pandemic The department also conducts a bimonthly survey of retailers through its regional offices collecting information from retailers on expected price changes of essential food items onemonth ahead which it uses in its nowcast of inflation A team from the Bank is working jointly with the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations ICRIER to develop a food inflation projection framework involving eminent agriexperts and market leaders in different food items Such initiatives must become the norm in other areas of research in the Bank 20 As I mentioned earlier there is increasing use of Big Data and data generated by private sources for policy research We cannot escape the fact that data is the new oil The department may have to look at all such data being mindful of ways to deal with misleading and noisy analysis that such data may at times throw up 21 For the research function in the Bank to remain effective it would require constant upgradation of skills of the economists in the department recognising the new possibilities in the information age and access to superior computing power at lower costs these days While the Bank has multiple schemes for training both in India and abroad for an economist there are two best ways to acquire the required skills first study and write more research papers regularly or learning by doing and second have a PhD that prepares you with all basic skills for conducting research An Economics Benchmark report by centralbankingcom in December 2021 after a survey of 33 central banks found that on average one in five economists in a central bank have a PhD I am glad to note that the Reserve Bank compares well as one in four economists in our research department has a PhD The Bank provides paid leave and financial incentives for staff to acquire PhD degrees and I hope in future our ranking would improve further An integral part of skill upgradation would be embracing new techniques for applied research With growing sophistication of the algorithms the manifold increase in the three Vs of data volume velocity and variety and the quantum leaps in computing human intelligence can be used better for analysis with AIML allowing automation of data processing 22 From the standpoint of the Bank research is increasingly becoming important to almost every major function as a result of which research units have been set up in other departments That process needs to be sustained and scaled up proactively Moreover in a vast and diverse country like India research on regional issues also merit policy attention 23 The department must internalise strategic medium to longterm research issues in its research agenda Separate teams may work on such issues This would help in identifying and maintaining a list of structural policy changes that can raise the growth trajectory of the economy in a sustainable and inclusive manner 24 The trifecta of deglobalisation climate change and deeper penetration of technology appears to be the most anticipated trend for the future This can be potentially disruptive requiring strategies to mitigate the associated risks The aftereffects of the three shocks I mentioned earlier are still unfolding and would warrant constant vigil The research function of the Reserve Bank therefore must remain prepared to respond to these multiple possibilities as it has done in the past 25 I wish the conference all success and do hope that the learnings from different sessions here would help the department in setting new goals to further strengthen the research function of the Bank 1 Feedback collected directly from stakeholders in several key sectors of the economy included vaccine manufacturing firms pharmaceutical companies transport operators hotels restaurants tour operators shopping malls amusement parks airport ground handling firms MSMEs mutual funds industry small finance banks and micro finance entities besides trade bodies and banks This helped in dealing with the information gap created by the pandemic
https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1334&fn=2759,Date Fifty Years of Indian Banking Through the Lens of Basic Statistical Returns,The Reserve Bank has a rich tradition of generating accurate and timely data policyoriented and topical economic research publication of statutory and other themebased reports and knowledgesharing Dr R B Barman former Chairman National Statistical Commission Shri S H Saoji Dr A K Nag and other former colleagues who contributed richly to the Basic Statistical Return BSR system senior officials from banks I am glad to see many Chief Compliance Officers CCOs of banks participating today Executive Directors and other colleagues from the Reserve Bank Ladies and Gentlemen 2 Today we celebrate the 50th year of the BSR system and pause to reflect on the way forward Any system which has served us for half a century would surely have inherent strengths and depth I believe that as an exhaustive data collection system the BSR has endured the test of time The development and maintenance of such a large system is demanding to say the least and it calls for constantly adapting to emerging realities For this I compliment my colleagues from the Department of Statistics and Information Management or DSIM The Reserve Bank has always strived to ensure that its policies are datadriven and in fact dataintensive Accordingly the Reserve Bank forms a significant part of the national statistical system Our early publications most of which have now been digitised and placed on our website profile the emphasis that the Reserve Bank has placed for decades past on information gathering systems censuses and surveys to secure meaningful inputs for policy making as well as to disseminate a wide and rich pool of information as a public good The BSR is a central feature of this hallowed history In fact the BSR has been a silent sentinel watching over the transformation of India banking and that is theme of my address today 3 For India banking services serve as the lubricant that turns the wheels of the economy In the early years agricultural finance became a priority for the Reserve Bank but comprehensive information for fashioning policies with the chisel of objective assessment was a yawning gap Way back in August 1943 the Reserve Bank wrote to all the state governments about and I quote from that correspondence having sample enquiries conducted rapidly in typical areas with a view to finding out the extent of indebtedness on the eve of the war how it has been affected by subsequent developments how agriculturists and moneylenders have reacted to them what are the tendencies and work for and against the utilisation of incomes for liquidation of old debts This shortfall was bridged postindependence by the Reserve Banks rural credit survey of 195152 It gave a detailed assessment of channels of finance in the hinterland which galvanised policies for expanding access to formal credit channels In those days the spread of banking assumed importance from the point of view of financially including farmers and small enterprises in order to reduce their reliance on informal sources of credit There was thus a concomitant objective of financial inclusion in banking policies of those early times 4 The next major milestone in the progress of Indian banking was the liberalisation of branch licensing policy in 1965 to check the tendency of banks to concentrate their branches in cities and major towns and to drive the expansion of branch networks to unserved and underserved areas The focus on credit to agricultural and small industries sectors remained steadfast through this reform These early developments led up to the establishment of the National Credit Council in 1967 It became a forum for assessing credit priorities on an allIndia basis so as to assist the Reserve Bank and the Government in the allocation of credit Notably the Council had to use credit data from multiple reporting systems as aggregate level regulatory reporting did not contain the desired dimensions2 This became the next challenge 5 The nationalisation of major commercial banks in 1969 was aimed to meet progressively and serve better the needs of development of the economy in conformity with national policy and objectives and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto3 This became the next milestone In this milieu the BSR system was introduced as a determined effort at systematising the reporting of banking data to ensure the availability of fairly comprehensive information with a minimum timelag to give more definite shape to the new policy of diversifying the pattern of credit4 6 Since then the BSR system has metamorphosed into a sound and comprehensive reporting system generating a wide array of useful statistics Combined with bank branch statistics popularly known as Master Office File or MOF system it has supported the postnationalisation expansion of the Indian banking system It has also caused attention to focus on financial inclusion by tracking the growing bank branch network and the access of the public to banking services 7 The collection and analysis of granular level financial data to assess the interconnectedness of financial institutions was brought forward in terms of priority after the global financial crisis GFC of 200809 Once again the BSR system has turned out to be well equipped and fortified well ahead of this need 8 Over the years innovations and demanding requirements resulting therefrom have led to several modifications in the BSR system in terms of coverage periodicity granularity and reference dates This unsung history is included in the Commemorative Volume being released today Developments in information technology have been exploited to improve quality and timeliness of statistics BSRs 3 4 5 6 and 8 have been discontinued As a part of further rationalisation to reduce the reporting burden on banks we also plan to discontinue the quarterly BSR 7 reporting from March 2023 This will leave us with only two BSRs viz BSR 1 on credit and BSR 2 on deposits both of quarterly frequency Regional rural banks RRBs will continue to report at annual frequency 9 We in the Reserve Bank regard the BSR as living returns continuously alive to structural changes in the economy and in the banking system and ready to quickly adapt and incorporate Let me give you a sense of the stories that the BSR has to tell We now have one commercial bank branch for every nine thousand citizens a far cry from a branch per forty thousand citizens in 1972 Commercial banks maintain around 225 lakh customer service points including over 175 lakh ATMs Cooperative banks also have a significant network of branches and ATMs In addition over nine lakh fixed point business correspondents BCs bring banking services virtually to the doorstep Digital banking has become a reality 10 The reach and spread of the banking network have improved the mobilisation of financial resources in the economy The number of deposit accounts per thousand population has increased from 43 in 1972 to over 1600 now Households currently account for 63 per cent of total bank deposits This is also reflected in the rise in the ratio of per capita bank deposits to income from 158 per cent to 712 per cent and the ratio of per capita credit to income from 122 per cent to 513 per cent over the period from 1972 to 2022 Branches across rural semi urban and urban areas have contributed to this mammoth financial intermediation 11 Patterns of financial intermediation are also shifting Industry has been a major recipient of bank credit but its share in total credit has come down from 60 per cent to 27 per cent during 19722022 broadly equal to that of services and personal loans In the personal loans segment borrowings by individuals now account for over 40 per cent as compared with less than 10 per cent share in 2000 This has ushered in to a unique phenomenon the share of smaller loans of up to Rs10 crore in total loans has increased to 60 per cent in 2022 from 45 per cent in 2014 This transformation has brought in its trail of associated changes in assessment risk management and pricing of loans On the lending side a feature that has impacted the banking system is the reduced role of term lending institutions and emergence of corporate treasuries with new avenues for shortterm financing This has resulted in a increased reliance on banks for longterm funds and b gradual reduction in the share of working capital in total loans Banks asset portfolios have become elongated with term loans accounting for 65 per cent of total loans 12 In conclusion I would say that the impetus for transformation has come calling as India already the fifth largest economy of the world prepares to be among the fastest growing economies and an engine of global growth 2nd largest contribution to global growth in 2022 By 202526 India will match Germany and become the fourth largest economy of the world By 2027 it will surpass Japan and emerge as the third largest economy of the world Indias population will become the largest in the world next year and its youngest It will demand the worlds best financial intermediation services Banks will have a critical role in this transformation Information will be the plumbing in this evolving architecture As we consolidate the gains of the past and move ahead to address new challenges it is going to be up to us all stake holders to keep the BSR system robust timely comprehensive and open to change Todays conference provides us an opportunity to prepare for this untravelled road that lies ahead Thank you 1 Speech delivered by Michael Debabrata Patra Deputy Governor Reserve

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1332&fn=2759,Date Reflections on Policy Choices in the Indian Financial System,The Reserve Bank has a rich tradition of generating accurate and timely data policyoriented and topical economic research publication of statutory and other themebased reports and knowledgesharing I Introduction Indian Financial System Looking back and looking ahead in the 75th year of Indian Independence Distinguished members of banking fraternity ladies and gentlemen It is a privilege to deliver the twelfth memorial lecture honouring the great legacy of late Shri RK Talwar I feel thankful and humbled for this opportunity as an occasion to remember personality like Shri RK Talwar given his contribution to the banking industry India recently celebrated 75 years of its independence and during this period our country has witnessed a transition to a promising and prominent force in the new global order However the journey is far from complete and a lot remains to be accomplished to realise our true potential Such occasions as these give us an opportunity to reflect on the path traversed the continuing and emerging challenges and the way ahead Shri R K Talwar took the helm at Indias largest bank at a very pivotal point in our banking history the period of nationalisation He reoriented the commercial banking to serve the underprivileged which aligned seamlessly with the objectives of nationalisation His emphasis on innovative banking rehabilitation of sick units convenient and accessible financing to small scale industries and credit impetus for rural development are testaments to his vision which later became the cornerstone of responsible banking paving way for inclusive development in our country Since independence our country has taken giant strides in growth and development in all sectors The GDP of India rose from a meagre Rs 5 lakh crore 195051 to about 147 lakh crore 202021 at constant prices of 201112 growing about 27 times with a CAGR of about 48 per cent But in the shadow of this growth story lies a duality which attracts the attention of every policymaker and concerned citizens Even as the GDP has grown 27fold in last seven decades the per capita income has grown merely sevenfold from about Rs14000 195051 to about Rs 1 lakh 202021 at constant prices of 201112 with a CAGR of about 29 per cent2 This duality highlights the importance and requirement of inclusive growth of our country a goal we all should aspire for and contribute towards in our respective professional capacities The evolution of the financial system too has been dotted with several twists and turns reflecting the policy choices made in a given socioeconomic and political context As is generally said policy making is not amenable to corner solutions The outcomes more often than not lie somewhere in the hazy middle reflecting the contextual tradeoffs In my remarks today I intend to dwell on some of these tradeoffs the idea being not to judge them for their existence or to contemplate about their counterfactuals but just to bring forth the specific structural paths our financial system has journeyed over the course of last seven decades whilst bolstering the everevolving Indian growth story I will therefore briefly touch upon some of such structural and regulatory dualities of Indian financial system which are integral to addressing some of the key questions that I highlight while venturing with a few thoughts of my own on the way ahead II Bankled vs marketled financial intermediation in India Is it possible to envision a transition from a bankdominated financial system to a nonbank intermediation channel There is extensive empirical evidence and literature which substantiates the claim that economic development of a country is closely associated with the development of financial system which creates an efficient system of pooling the savings and channelising them to productive capacities of the country While bank credit has historically been a dominant source of financing in India the same has been supplemented over the period by nonbank channels which have grown significantly in last one decade or so India now has more than 10 crore demat accounts and there has been a spurt in the entities accessing primary market to raise funds Relatively newer entrants to this game Mutual Funds have clocked assets under management AUM of around Rs 40 lakh crores The corporate bond market has also grown significantly though structurally it remains confined to better rated corporates with the expected penetration down the credit curve remaining an enduring challenge There has been a steady increase in the corporate bond issuances and the outstanding amount has crossed Rs 40 lakh crore as of March 2022 As we all know corporate bond market acts as a risk diffuser within the financial system redistributing the risk among a larger set of investors While the gradual shift in the flow of credit from banks to marketbased mechanisms has been evident the road has been longer in our case as we can still see the centrality of banks in the economic system Ironically banks have also been supporting several market segments of nonbank intermediation channel as providers of secondary market liquidity for credit enhancement and as market makers This makes the job of Reserve Bank as a regulator even more critical because of the interconnectedness of all economic agents with the banking system The government SEBI and the Reserve Bank have taken several steps to develop corporate bond market SEBI has put in place a market microstructure for corporate bonds in the form of DvP settlement electronic bidding platform and reporting of trades to increase transparency in pricing Reserve Bank has also endeavoured to develop complementary markets such as repo and CDS to supplement the efforts of SEBI We firmly believe that with growing need for credit the sources would also need diversification This would enable a competitive pricing of credit risk among the market participants and give more bargaining power to the companies looking to fund their growth and expansion and thus would be beneficial to the real sector However let me emphasize here that over the years there is one key aspect in which the role of banks has become more and not less important inclusiveness of intermediation both geographic as well demographic The banking sector has over the years borne much of the burden in this regard absorbing a lot of costs in the process Any assessment of the performance of the banking system visvis other channels must not lose sight of this critical aspect III Ownership Public vs Private Does there exist a middle ground in the debate Indian banking system has a very distinguishing characteristic preandpost liberalisation Before liberalisation Indian economy was largely a mixed economy with government playing a dominant economic role for planned development This economic structure was well aligned with the contemporaneous banking structure where public sector banks owned roughly 90 per cent of total banking assets in India especially after two major episodes of nationalisation of banks 1969 and 1980 The genesis of financial sector reforms in India could be attributed to the recommendations of the Committee on the Financial System chaired by Shri M Narasimham in 1991 popularly known as Narasimham Committee1 Based on the recommendations of the committee the dual regulation of banks was proposed to be removed interest rates were largely deregulated Statutory Liquidity Ratio SLR and Cash Reserve Ratio CRR were reduced to increase the productive capacity of bank capital and more importantly the banking sector started to get reorganised with entry of private sector and foreign banks The idea of introducing new banks was to improve the competitiveness of the banking system for better allocative efficiency Since commencement of their business the new age private sector banks have been contributing increasingly to the credit needs of the economy In about last 25 years their share in total credit has increased from about 3 per cent in 199697 to 36 per cent in 2021213 While private banks have had their share of problems their presence has made the financial system more resilient and has provided impetus to the efforts of financial deepening in form of an accelerated growth in bankcredit to GDP ratio from about 267 per cent in 1995 to about 52 per cent in 20214 As regards the public sector banks their role has been extensively debated over the years The idea of banking consolidation was first pitched in the Narsimham Committee1 through establishment of a threetier banking structure i three large banks with international presence ii eighttoten national banks and iii large number of regional and local banks It is argued that large consolidated banks may potentially have better risk diversification due to economies of scale and capacity to finance large projects The latter rationale of consolidation becomes more pertinent as Indian firms and their concomitant credit requirements grow Government of India has been facilitating consolidation of public sector banks in India over last few years As a result the number of public sector banks has reduced from 27 as of Mar 2017 to 12 as of Jun 2022 The number of private sector banks has remained constant at 21 during the same period The consolidation of public sector banks does not seem to have had any negative impact on their outreach or inclusive banking efforts as the total number of bank branches has largely remained same with minor reductions due to rationalisation preandpost merger Besides the financial inclusion efforts have already transcended to a business correspondent led model leveraging on technology At a broader level for enabling a reasonable level playing field there would have to be a gradual convergence in terms of the operating space and flexibility available to each class of entity In terms of regulatory and prudential norms governing the Public and Private Sector banking operations there is already a significant amount of convergence Therefore from prudential perspective the debate is infructuous However the same level of convergence would have to be extended to managerial and operational flexibility of PSBs based on certain governance standards Going forward this will generate the requisite space for both PSBs as well as private banks to grow their business and thrive IV Business models Diversified vs Specialised Does the promise of niche specialised banking still hold With widespread digital revolution and massive penetration of internet in Indian households the need for aligning banking practices of 21st century with new aspirations of India was felt Based on this evolving scenario a committee under the chairmanship of Dr Nachiket Mor the then member of central board of RBI was constituted to study the scope of comprehensive financial services to small businesses and lowincome households The committee submitted its report in 2013 and discussed idea of differentiated banking in India on the basis of horizontal and vertical differentiation involving formation of separate stylised banks on the basis of regionalsectoral scope and activities deposit transaction or credit The concept of payment bank was first discussed in that report which started the formal discourse on differentiated banking Subsequently the union finance minister announced in 201415 budget speech that RBI will create a framework for licensing Small Finance Banks SFBs and other differentiated banks In accordance with the announcement Reserve Bank issued guidelines for setting up SFBs and Payments Banks PBs in November 2014 The specified objectives of setting up of SFBs as envisaged in the licensing guidelines5 is to further financial inclusion by provision of savings vehicles and increase supply of credit to small business units small and marginal farmers micro and small industries and other unorganised sector entities through high technologylowcost operations On similar lines PBs were setup with the objective to further financial inclusion by providing small savings accounts and paymentsremittance services to migrant labour workforce lowincome households small businesses other unorganised sector entities and other users6 Since their inception SFBs have started playing a progressive role in mobilising savings from and providing credit to their niche customer segments furthering the cause of financial inclusion The growth of aggregate deposits and credit of SFBs have been significant since March 2018 In the quarter ended Mar 2022 the deposits grew by 373 per cent on yoy basis while growth in credit portfolio was 256 per cent as against growth rate of deposits and credit of SCBs at 102 per cent and 108 per cent respectively7 Although it may seem unfair to compare the concerned numbers of public and private sector banks to SFBs because of scaleeffects even in terms of outreach through bank branches SFBs represent about 4 per cent of bank branch network in India currently expanding from less than 1 in 20178 Payments Banks are truly firstgeneration new age differentiated banks designed on activity based functional differentiation The impact of these banks on digital payment economy and doorstep banking cannot be assessed just by their points of presence but also from the data of facilitated digital transactions Just to give you all a perspective on this the payments banks facilitated a total of about 114 crore mobile banking transactions amounting Rs17465 crore in value in the month of June 2020 which has increased to 473 crore transactions with aggregate value of about Rs46338 crore in just two years August 2022 growing by 41 times in terms of volume and 27 times in terms of value It is also important to highlight that as of August 2022 there were 25 crore active users of payments banks using their mobile banking facilities representing about 27 per cent of all active internet users in India9 The primary objective of a differentiated banking structure as alluded earlier was to expand the reach of financial services and institutions with financial inclusion being the overarching objective Therefore the underlying premise of differentiated banking institutions is based on differentiated reach As we all are experiencing now almost all banks have or are adopting technology to improve and expand delivery of financial services and products The Reserve Bank has been taking progressive measures to improve availability of digital infrastructure for banking services and this process recently got a significant boost by the launch of 75 Digital Banking Units DBUs by Honble Prime Minister These DBUs will be set up in 75 districts to commemorate 75 years of independence under the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav for a targeted Digital Banking drive The DBUs would facilitate the customers in embarking the digital journey through digital modeschannels in a paperless efficient safe and secured environment enhance financial inclusion and make available the full array of financial service products to the public in a seamless and efficient manner and enhance their banking experience These DBUs would also help in creating awareness on various aspects on digital banking lessening the hesitation among customers towards availing digital financial services and thereby catalyse faster adoption of digitization Establishment of DBUs is a noteworthy step to augment digital infrastructure for banking services in the country and facilitate a seamless banking experience Given the scope to scale up the financialisation of the Indian economy10 and accelerate the pace of financial inclusion there exists enough space for differentiated financial institutions to operate and grow At the same time it needs to be ensured that business models have to be sufficiently robust to provide the required financial resilience and good governance and technological standards are adhered to while striving to fulfil their desired objectives V Innovation vs Customer Protection Technologyenabled innovation in financial services has been one of the greatest disrupters to the traditional way of banking Alternate models of lending are rapidly changing the market dynamics and affecting the role of traditional intermediaries While banks have access to lowcost deposits tech firms advantage is that with technologys aid they can utilise a range of data alternate inputs for evaluating creditworthiness or who to lend to From a regulatory standpoint while there are strong arguments for making sure that the traditional vehicles of lending continue there is a view that regulators are reluctant to encourage fintech led innovations and this approach is perceived to unfairly skew the balance in favour of banks To my mind this would not be the right inference technological changes need to be imbibed in digestible doses to forestall destabilising of the financial system No doubt growth of tech led innovation need to be fostered but preserving financial system stability is an overriding objective for the Regulators and achieving the right mix of ensuring stability while fostering innovation remains the goal Therefore regulators expect that the nature of partnership between traditional banks and the new fintech players to evolve into a symbiotic one and not necessarily an adversarial one This could create a winwin outcome for all the stakeholders but one challenge that may arise is that of proxy disintermediation with the attendant risks of financial activities taking place outside the regulatory perimeter The recent guideline on digital lending is an attempt to have an enabling framework balancing competing considerations Most of the innovations in the delivery of financial services have an inherent aspect of conduct the choice between exploitative vs responsible conduct It is important to establish a common denominator of what is responsible This dimension has a lot more subjectivity while seeking to address the issue Ethical and responsible banking being sensitive to the needs of people we are serving being inclusive in our approach to vulnerable sections of the society taking prudent financial decisions these all are the choices which are always available to each one of us engaged in the financial sector Banking fraternity being the trust bearer of the society owes it to people and the country to be sensitive inclusive responsible and prudent Our financial institutions have navigated and will continue to navigate through these choices Adopting unfair means oblivious to the consequences may push top line in the short run but will potentially harm organisation in the long run After all financial institutions are not in this business for few years but for a long haul Hence purely from a business point of view it makes a lot of sense to act in the interest of all stakeholders All aspects affordability accessibility and especially the appropriateness should therefore be adhered whenever we design a financial product or deliver it Breaching any of the above cannot be a choice at all VI Concluding remarks I have tried to briefly highlight the critical dualities of Indian financial system As mentioned earlier I do not intend to judge any of these categories The only intention to bring forth these dualities is to emphasize the largely organic evolution of Indian financial system in response to our growing economy and highlight that the regulatory frameworks of RBI have facilitated meeting the everchanging needs of the country At every juncture of growth in financial system at every kink there are innumerable policy choices for a regulator The decisions we make today have the potential to shape the present and future of our economy and our nation But sometimes we can wonder on what could have been the counterfactual and answering such a counterfactual is difficult But it can be most certainly stated that the depth size and resilience of Indian financial system owes much to such decisions in past taken at various crossroads One may well argue that these policy choices were not necessarily proactive but sometimes reactive as well True Central Bankers do not have liberty to innovate freely we have to put our mandate and financial stability first There have been times when we are appreciated for our prudent policies and times when we are criticised for being conservative But let me assure you whatever we do we strive to do in broader public interest Every policy stance of ours is customised to the need of our growing economy and preserving financial stability and that remains our guiding principle In a conventional setup the banking regulation has some prespecified toolkits which are time tested and globally adopted Every financial crisis offers some insights to the regulators and the toolkit is accordingly modified in response to the lessons learnt But with a dynamically evolving financial system regulators do not have liberty to rely excessively on existing means because many of the potential challenges emanating from the emerging financial order are not foreseeable Worldwide regulators are striving to remain ahead of the curve because they simply cannot afford to be reactive in this environment The changes we feel to be insignificant can now grow manifold in a very short span of time posing threat to the stability of financial system Therefore we have to be cognisant of all the financial changes happening around and respond appropriately to such changes As the regulatory perimeter gradually extends to uncharted domains climate finance regulation of digital lending etc some of these issues will become even more relevant To guide us in this transition we have tried to fix some broad principles that make the policy stances adaptive enough to cope up with any present and future challenges while creating enabling environment for innovations with positive externalities At a broad level three guiding principles that would be helpful in framing financial regulation going ahead are principlebased proportionate and activitybased regulations In an uncertain business environment it is very difficult to predict and then prescribe all possible scenarios of a financial transaction Therefore such complex superstructure warrants that regulator should move away from rulebased prescriptive regime to principlebased regime and the principles of regulation should always have the financial stability and interests of consumers at its core The second principle for present and future regulation should be a differentiated regulatory system based on size complexity and contribution to systemic risk Further as the interconnectedness scope of activities and harmonisation of financial intermediation increases entitybased regulatory architecture may create arbitrage between different entities undertaking similar activity Therefore going forward activity should form a common regulatory thought for future regulations Let me end by citing a few lines from the wellknown poem by Robert Frost which not only resonates with what I just said but also touches upon the theme of this lecture the reflection on policy choices Two roads diverged in a yellow wood And sorry I could not travel both I took the one less travelled by And that has made all the difference Thank you once again IIBF for organising this lecture and giving me an opportunity to share my thoughts And thank you to all the distinguished guests for your patient listening Thank you

https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Speeches.aspx?Id=1324&fn=2759,Date Dynamics of Inflation in South Asia,The Reserve Bank has a rich tradition of generating accurate and timely data policyoriented and topical economic research publication of statutory and other themebased reports and knowledgesharing Good afternoon and a warm welcome to South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation SAARC central bank colleagues participating in this first physical seminar under the aegis of SAARCFINANCE after the onset of the pandemic Greetings to Ms Dechen Pelzom Executive Director Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan We are delighted to have with us colleagues from the Ministry of Finance and virtual participants from our central banks the Bank for International Settlements BIS and the International Monetary Fund IMF I am joined in our appreciation of your participation by colleagues from the Reserve Bank of India RBI representing various departments This Seminar marks the fulfilment of the commitment made by India in the 41st meeting of the SAARCFINANCE Governors Group in March 2021 Given the developments in our countries and the global inflation crisis gripping the world around us the seminars theme the Dynamics of Inflation and its Control in South Asia could not have been more timely and relevant From a broader perspective seminars and workshops of this type under the mandate of SAARCFINANCE have proved to be an effective avenue for intensifying our engagement through sharing of knowledge and experiences as well as by energising persontoperson interactions Our next seminar will be on the SAARCFINANCE database which will be hosted by the Maldives Monetary Authority SAARC Our History By way of historical background the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation SAARC was created in 1985 as an expression of the collective desire for fostering shared understanding and collaboration in our region At present Afghanistan Bangladesh Bhutan India Nepal Maldives Pakistan and Sri Lanka are members of the SAARC Over the years our countries have developed strong linkages in the form of trade remittances and financial transactions over and above our strong cultural ties and shared history We now look forward to strengthening our economies with the goal of accelerating economic development and prosperity by tapping into the full growth potential of the region SAARCFINANCE The Journey SAARCFINANCE was established in 1998 as a network of our Central Bank Governors and Finance Secretaries to facilitate dialogue on macroeconomic policies and the exchange of mutual experiences and ideas SAARCFINANCE received formal recognition in January 2002 at the 11th SAARC Summit held in Kathmandu Nepal Over the last two decades cooperation between our central banks has expanded and strengthened The swap facility which has been the cornerstone of this cooperation has played a vital role in helping to manage external sector pressures during the pandemic India has also extended financial support in the form of a number of credit lines to SAARC partners Policy interface technical assistance capacity building and knowledge exchange have all played a vital role in deepening this engagement In particular research and policy driven collaborative studies and symposiums and seminars such as this one have facilitated this whole endeavour by bringing about greater appreciation of the issues challenges and successes experienced by each country and the region as a whole To cite some fulfilled deliverables under the belt of SAARCFINANCE the Governors Group Meetings have formalised our cooperation and dialogue on macroeconomic conditions and policies The SAARCFINANCE website was developed and launched in 2011 The SAARCFINANCE Database went live on May 26 2016 at the Governors Symposium held in Mumbai The first issue of the halfyearly SAARCFINANCE eNewsletter was published in December 2006 During Indias Chair in 202021 the portal called SAARCFINANCE Sync was created as a network of connectivity among our central banks The scope and coverage of the Scholarship Scheme was expanded by including more universities more central banking related courses and by increasing both the scholarship amounts and the number of scholarships that may be granted in a year Efforts have also been made to revamp the SAARCFINANCE newsletter with a new design and format and by expanding its ambit to topical articles Our virtual seminars kept alive our engagement through the pandemic The Financial Inclusion Platform a repository of initiatives taken by SAARC central banks to promote financial inclusion and financial literacy has also facilitated policy making by enriching it with panregional perspectives The measures we have taken to deepen cooperation on capacity building are also noteworthy especially the collaborative studies on a variety of topics Macroeconomic Developments Opportunities and Challenges Our countries have come together to jointly fight COVID19 by establishing an exclusive SAARC COVID19 Emergency Fund with contributions from all members As a leading producer of vaccines India has remained deeply committed to equitable access India has delivered vaccines to many SAARC countries within a month from the rollout of its Vaccine Maitri Initiative in January 2021 The RBI remains committed to expanding cooperation in the field of digital banking and finance Its Payment Vision 2025 envisages global outreach of our real time gross settlement RTGS the National Electronic Funds Transfer NEFT the Unified Payment Interface UPI and RuPay Cards For instance Bhutan and India have built cooperation around RuPay cards so that Bhutanese banks can issue RuPay Cards to their citizens The share of intraSAARC trade in total exports of SAARC countries has increased from 61 per cent in 2010 to 71 per cent in 2020 Similarly the share of intraSAARC trade in total imports of SAARC countries has increased from 36 per cent in 2010 to 50 per cent in 2022 The pace of expansion of trade remains slow however even relative to other regional groupings like ASEAN Being severely hit by the pandemic the region witnessed economic contraction in 2020 A tenuous recovery coursed through 2021 with varying degrees of traction and pitfalls across the region The scars of the pandemic are still deep and painful in several parts of our region In 2022 elevated and persistent inflation has taken hold threatening to undermine the nascent progress made in 2021 Several members face double digit inflation in high reaches Global spillovers in the form of exchange rate volatility elevated commodity prices and supply chain pressures have exacerbated imported inflation Since February this year shortages of essential commodities and soaring food and energy prices have threatened livelihood and the welfare of our people On the external front terms of trade shocks and tightening global financial conditions have translated into wider current account deficits capital outflows high volatility in domestic financial markets and losses of reserves while amplifying external vulnerabilities Some of us are also experiencing debt distress Access to international financial markets constrained by rating downgrades by various external credit rating agencies has worsened external liquidity and financing conditions Some of us need urgent access to multilateral support in these challenging conditions Theme of the Seminar The theme of the seminar assumes significance in this milieu With inflation broadening across national jurisdictions repeated shocks stemming from the outbreak of the pandemic and more recently due to the war have translated into an inflation crisis not seen in years According to the IMFs World Economic Outlook Update of July 2022 surging commodity prices and broadening price pressures may cause inflation to reach 66 per cent in 2022 in advanced economies and 95 per cent in emerging market and developing economies posing a clear and present danger to macroeconomic stability In response the most synchronised and frontloaded monetary policy tightening ever seen in decades is underway Consequently as liquidity and monetary conditions harden the probability of a recession or hard landing has risen in advanced economies to levels that have preceded actual recessions in the past Central banks all over the world are aggressively striving to regain and entrench their credibility so as to anchor inflation expectations and bring inflation under control Despite the diversity of the South Asian region in terms of country size economic and social development geography population trade and political systems this daunting spectre of inflation haunts us all Food is a large part of our average consumption basket as well as our price indices its share in consumer prices ranging across the region between 35 and 47 per cent South Asia is most vulnerable to food inflation given the large segment of our populations battling poverty Moreover this is a region in which it is rising food prices that can trigger second round effects leading to the generalisation of inflation and its persistence Furthermore dependence on oil imports has made our countries commonly vulnerable to terms of trade and supply shocks Consequently inflation dynamics in the region show strong comovements with common drivers On the other hand our policy frameworks are somewhat diverse reflecting countryspecific circumstances and this will condition our approach to controlling inflation Our exchange rate regimes also reflect this diversity Dealing with the inflation crisis has become complicated as we battle global spillovers on an ongoing basis The region now faces a tremendous developmental challenge within which recovering the losses due to black swan events like the pandemic look the most formidable Our countries have also experienced sharp increases in fiscal deficits and deterioration of the balance of payments The future appears uncertain and gloomy against the backdrop of an unprecedented slowdown in economic activity employment and export earnings Risks to our growth prospects are slanted to the downside The dark shadow of stagflation looms over us and our outlook The Indian Experience In India we have adopted an inflation targeting framework since 2016 with a target of 4 per cent defined in terms of headline CPI inflation within a tolerance band of 2 per cent around it Policy decisions are taken by a majority vote by a monetary policy committee MPC There are strong accountability criteria embedded into the framework by legislation and associated regulations in the case of deviations of inflation outcomes from the target While inflation averaged under 4 per cent during 201620 it rose to 62 per cent in 202021 the year of the pandemics first wave Although it moderated in the following year ie 202122 to 55 per cent and was projected to ease further to 45 per cent in 202223 as recently as February 2022 the war in Ukraine has altered the outlook drastically Although it appears to be moderating from its peak of 78 per cent in April this year we would prefer to await more incoming data before we are convinced that this a durable trend While some easing of international commodity prices and supply chain pressures both globally and domestically are positive developments upside risks remain in the form of potential second order effects and the transmission of input cost pressures to the sticky core component of inflation For the financial year 202223 AprilMarch as a whole the RBI has projected that headline CPI inflation would average 67 per cent Accordingly the RBI has embarked on a frontloaded monetary policy response with a cumulative 140 basis points increase in the policy rate so far besides narrowing of the policy rate corridor in April that pulled up money market rates by 40 basis points from pandemic lows In its latest meeting in early August the monetary policy committee MPC decided to remain focused on withdrawal of accommodation to ensure that inflation remains within the target going forward while supporting growth Simultaneously the RBI is engaged in withdrawal of the liquidity infused into the economy during the pandemic in a calibrated multiyear time frame As the inflation forecast performs the role of an intermediate target in the monetary policy framework the RBI has taken several initiatives to strengthen inflation monitoring and improve the accuracy of forecasting Besides widening the ambit and depth of a suite of forwardlooking surveys a data science lab has been set up to explore alternative forecasting techniques and models including artificial intelligence and machine learning AIML In view of the sizable share of food in the consumer price index and the fact that the Indian economy is prone to supply shocks work on assessing the crop situation through remote sensing has also been started in the data science lab to assist inflation forecasting In addition new initiatives are being taken to gauge the publics expectations through sentiment analysis that should inform the forecasting exercise and thereby improve precision We have also stepped up the gathering of marketbased intelligence from trade bodies traders domain experts and regional units The intent is to assimilate as much useful information as possible and enrich our understanding of inflation dynamics In the nearterm however the inflation trajectory continues to be heavily contingent upon the evolving geopolitical developments international commodity market dynamics and global financial market developments Concluding Remarks As central banks and public institutions we are entrusted with ensuring and maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability and ensuring the progress of our economies to secure the full actualisation of our developmental aspirations We face challenging tradeoffs in our daytoday functioning and keen public scrutiny Mostly unsung our role has undergone a transformation in recent years From lenders of the last resort we have become defenders of the first resort Hence our response to inflation shocks such as the one we face today has to be predicated on managing expectations and fortifying credibility If credibility is high and the shock is transitory inflation returns to equilibrium without the need for any monetary policy action On the other hand repeated supply shocks which we are encountering now trigger second round effects through cost pushes expectations exchange rate and demand channels warranting preemptive monetary policy action Even with perfect credibility monetary policy cannot look through the secondround effects of repeated supply shocks If the inflation target is breached for a prolonged period this could unsettle expectations and eventually get reflected in higher inflation Higher credibility can reduce not substitute for the monetary policy response to second round effects of repeated supply shocks At the current juncture our experience is that by frontloading monetary policy actions credibility is demonstrated by showing commitment to the inflation target Another dimension of monetary policy credibility is the timing of its response A delay in the monetary policy response leads to a further loss of credibility unhinging of inflation expectations and eventually higher inflation outcomes with a higher sacrifice of growth SAARC has great potential for economic expansion with abundant natural resources human capital and market access The promotion of economic and social development through increased trade and investment and through deeper regional economic integration holds considerable promise in South Asia We must rise up to this challenge and seize the window of opportunity even as we recover from the debilitating effects of the pandemic and geopolitical developments High quality research and engagements in seminars such as this one will help us build capacity and technical skills illuminating our way forward The Roadmap of Regional Cooperation which was framed in 2016 needs to be revised to reflect the current realities and focus areas with quantifiable milestones and timelines within the mandate of SAARCFINANCE I wish you all success in your deliberations Thank you 1 Keynote address

publication of statutory and other themebased reports and knowledgesharing Dr Hrudananda Panda Regional Director Reserve Bank of India RBI Bhubaneswar distinguished guests of the RBI from the Government of Odisha academia banks financial institutions industry associations the media scholars and students my colleagues from the RBI Ladies and Gentlemen I am deeply honoured to be invited to deliver this address as part of the celebration of the 75th year of our Independence I thank Dr Panda for inviting me and more than that for the innovative drive and gracious hospitality he and his team which has made this event possible At this defining moment the elixir of energy inspiration new ideas and pledges awakens us to a bright and selfreliant future marked by the fulfilment of our dreams In many ways Bhubaneshwar is the embodiment of this Mahotsav a rich and glorious heritage a happening present and a smart city of the future in every respect Tribhuvan While my talk will attempt to kaleidoscope Indias journey through the last 75 years the focus is on the future India in the next 1050 years It is said that there is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come2 I do believe with the all the strength of my conviction that Indias time has come As the famous song marking the UNs International Day of Peace goes3 you may say I am a dreamer but I hope that after my talk I will not be the only one You too will dream with me and the world will be as one So I invite you to join me in this journey of dreams as India takes off to make a tryst with destiny India at Takeoff It is said that if the history of the universe can be compared to a journey of a 100 km it will not be until the 71st km or a little later that one will encounter life and the entire period of human existence comprises the last 12 metres Seen against this humbling perspective independent Indias journey of 75 years has been quite astonishing Between 2006 and just before the COVID19 pandemic struck more than 300 million people in India have been lifted out of poverty the highest rate of poverty reduction anywhere in the world The Indian economy is a world leader in the production of various agricultural commodities In 2021 India has emerged as the worlds Number 1 rice exporter with more than the combined exports of world Numbers 2 and 3 India has one of the widest manufacturing bases among emerging economies ranging from the largest producer and exporter of tractors and two wheelers to among the top 10 exporters of smartphones cars and spacecraft In several services including shipping personnel and information technology IT India is a world leader In the case of IT India has come to be known as the back office of the world A widely used indicator of economic progress of a country is the growth of gross domestic product which is the value of all the final goods and services produced in an economy during say a quarter or a year If one looks back over the last 75 years statistical tests BaiPerron structural break tests reveal that Indias growth trajectory has gone through three phases Up to the 1970s India averaged GDP growth of 36 per cent the so called Hindu rate of growth which has been associated with inwardlooking policies adopted over that period Growth picked up to 55 per cent during 1980 2002 as liberalisation opening up and an outward orientation commenced Thereafter GDP growth rose to an average of about 7 per cent till the pandemic arrived In 202021 GDP declined by 66 per cent due to the pandemic In 202122 it recovered to 87 per cent taking GDP 15 per cent above its prepandemic level For the current financial year ie 202223 the RBI has projected GDP to grow by 72 per cent which places India among the fastest growing economies of the world What are the drivers of Indias growth It turns out that the Indian economy is powered by We the people private final consumption expenditure PFCE comprising households spending on goods services rents insurance pension contributions and such other expenses that correspond with daily livelihood Private consumption constitutes 55 per cent of GDP although this share has come down from above 75 per cent in the 1960s There have been phases of exportled and investmentled growth which could not be sustained but they did provide turning points in the growth path In particular investment which is the production of goods that in turn produce other goods is seen as Indias game changer as for most developing countries that are capital scarce The investment rate total investmentGDP is widely regarded as the most important lever of growth in India A striking feature in India is that our growth is home financed investment is financed primarily by domestic savings with foreign savings playing only a supplemental role Another noteworthy feature is that the saving rate has started slowing down since 200708 after the global financial crisis Eventually this pulled down the investment rate which has exhibited deceleration since 201213 Reversing this trend is critical to achieve higher growth The current account deficit CAD in the countrys balance of payments BoP determines how much of foreign savings or net capital inflows into the country can be absorbed or used for growth Exports earn foreign exchange while imports have to be paid for in foreign exchange A country like India relies on the rest of the world for imports of items we dont produce such as crude oil and items such as machinery equipment and technology in which other nations either have a comparative advantage or they closely hold For India imports typically exceed exports and hence earnings of foreign exchange are not sufficient for covering import payments The gap has to be filled by borrowing from abroad which however has to be serviced through principal and interest payments If debt servicing exceeds our earnings we have to either reduce imports and stifle our growth prospects or default on debt payments and face international isolation Our experience has been that India can sustain a current account deficit of 2530 per cent without getting into an external sector crisis In fact in a telling reminder of this fact a record increase in oil prices and high gold imports took the current account deficit above this Plimsoll line and to historically high levels during 201113 When the US Federal Reserve contemplated the end of easy monetary policy in the summer of 2013 India faced the taper tantrum and was labelled as among the fragile five4 A CrossCountry Perspective Stepping back a little it is useful to observe Indias progress in a crosscountry setting Let me turn to the rise and fall of the top ten economies of the world since the early 1960s when developing countries in Asia started to put in place strategies for takeoff after two centuries of western dominance Noteworthy is the age of Japan which started in the 1960s and lasted through 1970s and 1980s The age of China began in the early 1990s taking it to the position of the second largest economy of the world It is from 2015 that Indias time seems to be arriving Today India is the worlds sixth largest economy in terms of market exchange rates For the year 2022 the International Monetary Fund IMF projects global growth at 32 per cent in 2022 lower than 61 per cent in 2021 India is projected to grow by 74 per cent in 2022 In spite of the pandemic and the war in Europe India is going to contribute about 14 per cent of global growth In fact India is likely to be the second most important driver of global growth in 2022 after China The use of market exchange rates for crosscomparisons of economic performance measured by GDP has been questioned After all exchange rates are subjected to bouts of volatility and idiosyncratic behaviour that makes them diverge from reality An alternative measure is purchasing power parity It is the price of an average basket of goods and services that a household needs for livelihood in each country An often used example is the McDonalds burger which is supposed to have the same wheat potatoes and other ingredients in every outlet in every country To show you how this works with the money paid in the US for a big Mac one can buy 25 Macs in India So what does this tell us about the exchange rate and GDP Currently India is the third largest economy in the world in terms of purchasing power parity PPP terms with a share of 7 per cent of global GDP after China 18 per cent and the US 16 per cent Indias GDP in market exchange rates is expected to reach US 5 trillion by 2027 By that year Indias GDP in purchasing power parity terms will exceed US 16 trillion up from US 10 trillion in 2021 The OECDs 2021 calculations indicate that the Indian economy will be overtake the US by 2048 This would make India the largest economy in the world after China In terms of PPP the exchange rate appreciates with the prosperity of a nation and a rise in its productivity The Indonesian Rupiah is set to become the strongest currency in the world with the Indian Rupee emerging as the second strongest currency The Window of Opportunity With this birds eye image of where India is today I will turn to the four engines that can power India to achieve escape velocity from the emerging economy orbit and take off towards becoming an economic superpower i Demographics I will start with the underlying realities of the widely cited demographic dividend The worlds population growth fell below 1 per cent for the first time in 2021 It will slow down through the rest of this century Indias population at 138 billion is the worlds youngest at 284 years By 2023 that is next year India will be the most populous country in the world 143 billion5 Aging will close Indias youth dividend by 2045 as it did for Japan in 2004 and Italy in 2002 This is evident from the changing structure of the population A key indicator is the total fertility rate the average number of children born to a woman over her lifetime As per the findings of Indias latest National Family Health Survey 201921 the total fertility rate TFR of 20 down from 22 in 201516 and 27 in 200506 has fallen below the replacement level for the first time According to the United Nations UN a generation with a total fertility rate6 lower than 21 is not producing enough children to replace itself Such a situation results in an outright reduction in the population of that country On the other hand the life expectancy of Indians has been rising and is likely to increase from the current level of about 70 years to about 82 years by 2099 A comparison of the ratio Indias workingage7 population WAP to the total population with that of other countries viz China Brazil USA and Japan shows that India stands at an advantageous position The workingage populations of these countries have started declining already while Indias WAP ratio will increase till 2045 even exceeding that of China by 2030 Making the most of this demographic dividend is Indias opportunity as well as a challenge ii Manufacturing Another engine for takeoff is manufacturing Indias development experience has been widely regarded as remarkable because it broke away from the usual path of a country moving from primary activities to secondary and then to tertiary activities8 India leapfrogged the secondary phase and progressed from primary activities to the tertiary sector Services account for twothirds of Indias economy today In hindsight the Indian experience may not have been the miracle it is credited to be India failed to absorb into gainful employment large masses of its lessskilled labour force that migrated from agriculture Apart from this labour absorptive capacity the manufacturing sector has backward and forward linkages with other sectors of the economy A robust growth of manufacturing is essential for boosting Indias exports Hence it is necessary to overturn the conventional wisdom and catch up with other leading manufacturers of the world According to the World Bank Indias manufacturing sector as a proportion to GDP in constant 2015 US dollar terms remains much below the world average as well as most peers The growth of Indian manufacturing has been quite volatile ranging between a peak of 178 per cent 200607 and a trough of 32 per cent 197980 Since the 1990s the average growth of manufacturing has been 7075 per cent If 75 per cent growth is attained in the next decade manufacturing would reach a share of 204 per cent of overall gross value added GVA by 203031 If manufacturing were to grow at 10 per cent the target set by the Make in India campaign its share would reach 25 per cent in 203031 India would become the manufacturing shop floor of the world with positive effects for employment and other sectors of the economy To achieve this three things are essential First the manufacturing sector must adapt to the fourth industrial revolution automation data exchange cyberphysical systems the internet of things cloud computing cognitive computing the smart factory and advanced robotics9 Second India must develop a skilled labour force by stepping up investment in human capital Third efforts must be directed to boost international competitiveness that allows manufacturing to find expression in global markets India must raise the share of manufacturing to at least 25 per cent of GDP to become a global manufacturing hub iii Exports Exports provide an avenue for the widening of markets and production capabilities beyond national borders Currently Indias exports of goods and services at close to US 800 billion constitute 27 per cent of the world total The Government of India has set a target of US 1 trillion to be achieved by 2030 This would take Indias share to 5 per cent of the global total and India would become an export powerhouse Several initiatives are in place to actualise this goal One District One Product ODOP initiative integrates the concept of Districts as Export Hubs The Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported products RODTEP scheme provides incentives in the form of refund of taxes on exported items in the range of 05 43 per cent of the value of exports covering around 8555 product lines Ubharte Sitaare scheme supports micro small and medium enterprises MSMEs in realising their export potential Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies RoSCTL scheme aims to make exports of apparelgarments globally competitive Under this scheme the exporters of apparel garments and madeups are refunded embedded taxes and levies which are currently not being rebated under any other mechanism Export potential in sectors such as IT and digital services high value agricultural products highvalue tourism financial services retail and ecommerce has to be tapped and exploited Raising Indias share in world exports to at least 5 per cent is within reach iv Internationalisation Indians are among the most internationalised people in the world The Indian diaspora is the biggest in the world and India is the top recipient of remittances The Indian rupee trades three times more offshore than onshore Yet we still talk of internationalisation as if it is a last frontier The economist Niall Ferguson writes that in human history there have been 70 empires The 69th and 70th empires are the Peoples Republic of China and the European Union respectively The 68th empire has all the attributes of an empire including waging wars beyond its borders Yet it is different in one fundamental way it does not annex foreign lands Ferguson calls it the reluctant empire it is the USA Drawing an analogy India can be regarded as a reluctant internationaliser If the INR turnover rises to equal the share of nonUS nonEuro currencies in global forex turnover 4 per cent the INR will have arrived as an international currency reflecting Indias position in the global economy Challenges Let me now address the challenges that confront us on the runway to takeoff In my view the focus should be on four major challenges The first one is the loss of output and livelihood due to the pandemic The agglutination of supply disruptions the health crisis an unparalleled mass migration and a hostile global environment took a heavy toll on the Indian economy The combination of demand compression and supply disruption that took hold in the pandemic and in its wake caused severe debilitating effects As stated earlier the Indian economy contracted by 66 per cent in 202021 In the first quarter of that year when the first wave of the pandemic raged GDP contracted by 24 per cent among the steepest in the world If a trend line is fitted to the level of Indias GDP and extended up to 202122 at the compound annual growth rate CAGR of 66 per cent that prevailed over 201320 a comparison for this trend GDP with the actual GDP in 202021 and 202122 will give a rough measure of the output lost to the pandemic Recovering this lost output may take several years this I will regard as the first most important challenge The second challenge is Indias infrastructure gap Indias per capita investment in infrastructure is one of the lowest in the world US 886 in constant 2015 dollars Infrastructure investment by India is currently around 46 per cent of GDP If India were to invest in infrastructure to the tune of 6 per cent of GDP it will achieve a GDP level of US 75 trillion by 2030 as estimated by the Global Infrastructure Hub10 and the infrastructure gap will close This is also consistent with our target of becoming a US 5 trillion economy by 2027 The main requirements for the infrastructure drive are transparent and faster regulatory processes clear transparent and efficient land acquisition and climate clearance policies and viable infrastructure finance that takes into long gestation in infrastructure projects Building world class infrastructure is the next big challenge for Indias takeoff The third challenge is developing a high quality labour force The contribution of labour in terms of both quality and quantity to GDP growth in India remains much lower than developed as well as many emerging market economies 83 per cent of the workforce is employed in the unorganised sector As India transforms into a manufacturing hub and powerhouse exporter the workforce has to expand and become more skilled over time The emphasis should be on increasing the contribution of the quality of growth to GDP rather than quantity Of Indias total labour force employability appropriate skills for a particular job is less than 50 per cent One important lever to break this constraint is to increase the participation of women in the workforce According to the World Bank World Development Indicators India ranks 178 among 187 countries in terms of the female labour force participation rate in 2020 We must create workplaces that do not stigmatise women at work and instead encourage them to earn their livelihoods with dignity and satisfaction This requires spreading awareness to influence social norms in favour of working women incentivising institutes to maintain diversity of students and employees flexible working hours women friendly policies and facilities at workplaces including taxation systems that are favourable for working parents and mandatory maternitypaternity leave across workspaces availability of work closer to the household and increased formalization of jobs Women participation is key to developing a high quality labour force The fourth challenge is a greener cleaner India At the Conference of the Parties 26 COP26 in Glasgow in November 2021 India took five pledges viz the Panchamrit reflecting its commitment towards the environment They include i attaining 500 gigawatts GW nonfossil energy capacity by 2030 ii energy mix comprising 50 percent renewable energy by 2030 iii reducing total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes from now onwards till 2030 iv reducing the carbon intensity of our economy by less than 45 percent by 2030 and v achieving net zero emissions by 2070 by cutting greenhouse gas emissions to as close to zero as possibleThe scale of finance needed to meet the above commitments is significant The Council on Energy Environment and Water11 has estimated that a cumulative investment of US 101 trillion is needed to meet net zero commitments by 2070 Of this US 84 trillion investment is needed to meet power sector transformation shift to renewable energy alone Industry reduction in coal and ramping up hydrogen usage will require US 15 trillion and the mobility sector is estimated to need US 198 billion There is a silver lining however in respect of renewables In order to reach 500 GW by 2030 renewables should grow at a compound annual growth rate of 142 per cent per annum At the current average rate of growth at 187 per cent 201415 to 202021 we may achieve the 500 GW target by 2027 India will require adequate energy storage facilities to wedge the gap between the timing of renewable power generation and actual power consumption We have to minimise transmission and distribution losses We have to address the regional concentration of renewable energy as it is location specific mostly the southern states and not evenly distributed The tariff structure must reflect actual costs while eschewing crosssubsidies that hurt industries and commercial establishments And we have to find a solution to the problem of legacy debts of DISCOMs Conclusion If India capitalises on its opportunities and overcomes the challenges that I have addressed in the time available for this talk it is widely believed that India will bend time So revisiting the purchasing power parity projections I alluded to earlier it is possible to imagine India striking out into the next decade with a growth rate of 11 per cent If this is achieved India will become the second largest economy in the world not by 2048 as shown earlier but by 2031 Even if it does not sustain this pace and slows to 45 per cent in 204050 it will become the largest economy of the world by 2060 As I said in my opening remarks you may think that I am a dreamer but let me remind you that while history does not repeat itself it often rhymes The distinguished British economist Angus Maddison who specialised in the measurement and analysis of economic growth and development has documented economic performance over long periods of time and across major countries in every continent of the world According to his work India was the largest economy of the world with the highest share in world GDP during 1 to 1000 AD Over the next 600 years India intermittently fell to the second position but reclaimed the position of the worlds largest economy by 1700 AD with a share of 244 per cent of world GDP Since then there has been an inexorable loss of share Ladies and gentlemen the time has come to halt the decline reverse it and repossess our rightful place on the worlds stage Thank you Annex 1 Speech delivered by Michael Debabrata Patra Deputy Governor Reserve

enterprises if a market value is not available at the close of business on March 31 September 30 Year estimate of the market value of your holding of equity securities can be calculated by using one of the six alternatives methods given in Q23 Debt securities should be recorded at market prices converted to domestic currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the close of business on March 31 September 30 Year For listed debt securities a quoted traded market price at the close of business on March 31 September 30 Year should be used When market prices are unavailable eg in the case of unlisted debt securities the following methods for estimating fair value which is an approximation of the market value of such instruments should be used discounting future cash flows to the present value using a market rate of interest and using market prices of financial assets and liabilities that are similar Q23 What is the method that can be used for approximating market prices for equity securities Ans When actual market values are not available an estimate is required Alternative methods of approximating market value of shareholders equity in a direct investment enterprise include the following Recent transaction price Unlisted instruments may trade from time to time and recent prices within the past year at which they were traded may be used Recent prices are a good indicator of current market values to the extent that conditions are unchanged This method can be used as long as there has been no material change in the corporations position since the transaction date Recent transaction prices become increasingly misleading as time passes and conditions change Net asset value Appraisals of untraded equity may be conducted by knowledgeable management or directors of the enterprise or provided by independent auditors to obtain total assets at current value less total liabilities excluding equity at market value Valuations should be recent within the past year and should preferably include intangible assets Present value and pricetoearnings ratios The present value of unlisted equity can be estimated by discounting the forecast future profits At its simplest this method can be approximated by applying a market or industry pricetoearnings ratio to the smoothed recent past earnings of the unlisted enterprise to calculate a price This method is most appropriate in which there is a paucity of balance sheet information but earnings data are more readily available Market capitalization method Book values reported by enterprises can be adjusted at an aggregate level by the statistical compiler For untraded equity information on own funds at book value can be collected from enterprises and then adjusted with ratios based on suitable price indicators such as the ratio of market capitalization to book value for listed companies in the same economy with similar operations Alternatively assets that enterprises carry at cost such as land plant equipment and inventories can be revalued to current period prices using suitable asset price indices Own funds at book value This method for valuing equity uses the value of the enterprise recorded in the books of the direct investment enterprise as the sum of a paidup capital excluding any shares on issue that the enterprise holds in itself and including share premium accounts b all types of reserves identified as equity in the enterprises balance sheet including investment grants when accounting guidelines consider them company reserves c cumulated reinvested earnings and d holding gains or losses included in own funds in the accounts whether as revaluation reserves or profits or losses The more frequent the revaluation of assets and liabilities the closer the approximation to market values Data that are not revalued for several years may be a poor reflection of market values Apportioning global value The current market value of the global enterprise group can be based on the market price of its shares on the exchange on which its equity is traded if it is a listed company Where an appropriate indicator may be identified eg sales net income assets or employment the global value may be apportioned to each economy in which it has direct investment enterprises on the basis of that indicator by making the assumption that the ratio of net market value to sales net income assets or employment is a constant throughout the transnational enterprise group Each indicator could yield significantly different results from the others Contact Details for
